Connor and i talked about this, where in screen info, you can choose ot pick a MIDI. I would like it to be able with MP3s as well!

Ideally how I would think we should do this is to make Enhanced Music work like Midis do- you have a list of numbered enhanced musics to play. The only problem is that script compat would take a lot of work to make the old script commands auto-translate to such a new system...
