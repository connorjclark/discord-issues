I've looked at every quest on the PZC database, and determined that these are the QRs that are both 1) not set in any quest and 2) don't _become set_ after applying compatability fixes while loading the quest

```
qr_EXPLICIT_RAFTING
qr_CONTFULL_DEP
qr_NOCLOCKS_DEP
qr_TEMPCLOCKS_DEP
qr_BRKBLSHLDS_DEP
qr_MAGICWAND_DEP
qr_MAGICCANDLE_DEP
qr_MAGICBOOTS_DEP
qr_NOROPE2FLASH_DEP
qr_NOBUBBLEFLASH_DEP
qr_GHINI2BLINK_DEP
qr_PHANTOMGHINI2_DEP
qr_NOPOTIONCOMBINE_DEP

qr_REDPOTIONONCE_DEP
qr_OLDTRIBBLES_DEP

qr_FADECS1
qr_BUGGY_BUGGY_SLASH_TRIGGERS
qr_ENEMIES_DONT_SCRIPT_FIRST_FRAME
qr_POUNDLAYERS1AND2
qr_NEW_HERO_MOVEMENT2
qr_CARRYABLE_NO_ACROSS_SCREEN
qr_NO_SCROLL_WHILE_CARRYING
qr_HELD_BOMBS_EXPLODE
qr_PARSER_NO_LOGGING
qr_WPNANIMFIX
qr_NOSCRIPTSDURINGSCROLL
qr_PARSER_FORCE_INLINE
qr_PARSER_BINARY_32BIT
qr_DO_NOT_DEALLOCATE_INIT_AND_SAVELOAD_ARRAYS
qr_PARSER_STRINGSWITCH_INSENSITIVE
qr_OLDMAPDATAFLAGS
qr_LOG_INVALID_UID_LOAD
qr_COMBODATA_INITD_MULT_TENK
qr_ZS_NO_NEG_ARRAY
```

That's 62 QRs. Some are probably just b/c they are recent additions (like `qr_ZS_NO_NEG_ARRAY`). Ignore those.

There's an opportunity here to simplify both the codebase and the massive amount of QRs users are faced with. Some things we could do:

1) Hide these from the ZQuest UI
2) On load quest in the player, if any rule is checked we show a dialog asking the user to alert us - `"We plan to remove functionality we thought was unused, but is required for this quest to work. Please alert the developers!"`
3) Eventually, mark these QRs in the code as `qr_DEAD_...` and delete their branches.

Before doing anything, I'd want to consume more quests than just what is on PZC. I guess the database on zeldaclassic.com _might_ have some oldies missing in PZC. Are there other sources?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:15

Sources:

- https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/blob/main/docs/quest_database.md (QRs as listed in the qst file)
- https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/blob/main/docs/quest_database_no_compat.md (QRs after loading quest and applying compats)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:21

BTW, another perspective worth looking at are QRs that are _always set_ (post-compat). That list is much shorter.

```
qr_BROKENHITBY
qr_BROKEN_RAFT_SCROLL
```

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:22

(I feel like something needs doublechecking here... qr_BROKENHITBY is brand new so I'd expect it to not be all on?)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:24

brokenhitby is the old array indexes; I don't think there's anything new enough to have it off partially because I don't think people turn compat rules off after loading tilesets

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:24

No, that makes sense. They get turned on when its broken. Ok, nothing to do for those two.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:29

``qr_BROKEN_ATTRIBUTE_31_32`` I guess probably no quest uses this but I was paranoid about breaking things if people relied on this behavior

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:29

BTW, the first list is in order of the QR#, so there's probably some point in the list where it makese since to split it - first half are old baggage QRs, latter half is just new stuff no quest has used yet

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:30

ahhh except sometimes QRs get added in the middle of the set. so nvm
_roughly_ in creation order üôÇ

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:31

``` qr_192b163_WARP
qr_8WAY_SHOT_SFX``` I feel like these were QRs that was reported to Zoria, who then implemented it as an emulation rule, which then got ported into QRs when those got deprecated
```ahhh except sometimes QRs get added in the middle of the set. so nvm``` me and Emily have a split so that we can both add QRs while minimizing merge conflicts

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:35

```qr_ARROWCLIP``` https://www.zeldaclassic.com/resource-listing/entry/83/
this quest broke because of the lack of this, reported by p-tux

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:37

Shit, I grabbed the wrong list. This one is all the QRs that are not explicitly set in the qst file, not post-compat. Let me update.

Updated.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:37

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "``` qr_192b163_WARP
qr_8WAY_S‚Ä¶"): ``qr_8WAY_SHOT_SFX`` 
```if ( tempheader.zelda_version < 0x250 ) 
    {
        set_bit(quest_rules, qr_8WAY_SHOT_SFX, 1);        
    }``` okay yeah, makes sense
```qr_EXPLICIT_RAFTING```... this is only defined and never used

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:39

Want me to make a spreadsheet for this?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:39

yes please
sorry for being disorganized

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:43

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1msCTFKJPNYl46hFvF2hKrFvkr5vnNQVVV4sDO2kPJqY/edit?usp=sharing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:43

there's apparently a thing called deprecated_rules? ``get_bit(deprecated_rules, qr_NOCLOCKS_DEP))``

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:43

yeah they get place in its own bitset
or are those from the old HDR?
before there was a RULE section
idk, it's v confusing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:45

Hell if I know...
```if((tempheader.zelda_version < 0x192)||
                ((tempheader.zelda_version == 0x192)&&(tempheader.build<149)))
        {
            set_bit(quest_rules,qr_BRKNSHLDTILES,(get_bit(quest_rules,qr_BRKBLSHLDS_DEP)));
            set_bit(deprecated_rules,qr_BRKBLSHLDS_DEP,1);
        }``` okay so it's setting the bit for qr_BRKBLSHLDS_DEP in deprecated_rules to 1 always if this code runs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:47

Good catch. My process is not detecting that then.
(wait... maybe it is?)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:47

```if(get_bit(deprecated_rules,qr_BRKBLSHLDS_DEP))
                tempguy->flags |= guy_bkshield;``` 
```if(get_bit(deprecated_rules,qr_BRKBLSHLDS_DEP))
            {
                guysbuf[i].flags |= guy_bkshield;
            }``` two places in the code are checking this
need to figure out if this is intentional or an oversight

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 22:55

This line copies from quest_rules to deprecated_rules: https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/blob/3e20ca69332b818e8799746d7d1e3dfdf8e3afa5/src/qst.cpp#L3114-L3114

Then these are the only 4 QRs that get set in `deprecated_rules` (straying from quest_rules):

```
qr_BRKBLSHLDS_DEP
qr_OLDTRIBBLES_DEP
qr_EXPLICIT_RAFTING
```

So my process only possibly overlooks those.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:57

Explicit rafting is 12

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 22:59

but comments indicate that deprecated_rules 12 is related to 24 heart containers
```if(get_bit(deprecated_rules, 12) != 0) // qr_24HC
                temp_sub->d3 = 1;```

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 23:02

```if(s_version<8)
    {
        set_bit(quest_rules, 12, 0);
    }
    else
    {
        set_bit(deprecated_rules, 12, 0);
    }``` I... have no clue what it's doing here

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 23:08

experimenting to find a good blame tool; smartgit had a really awesome blame tool for GUI and that's the one thing that Github Desktop is missing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 23:09

I just go to the website and use the blame tool there
Can step back as needed
Might get a deadend at 7 years ago Initial commit lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/06/2023 23:15

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Might get a deadend at 7 year‚Ä¶"): when I get a deadend there I have to manually go through the older versions that we have

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2023 23:17

subversion or git? Can you put them on the GitHub org?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/07/2023 00:04

they should be on the github org

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/07/2023 00:06

not a *full* history but can be used to view stuff at specific milestones

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/07/2023 00:08

under the 2.50 branch, there's commits for basically every major 2.50 beta too

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/07/2023 00:09

every file has a different, allcaps name before a certain point so that's a bit of an annoyance

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 00:52

I'm thinking some of these literal ones (like `tempitem.wpn2 = get_bit(deprecated_rules,27) ? wSSPARKLE : 0; //qr_SASPARKLES`)  _used_ to be the actual QR 27 constant, but when it was "deprecated" the QR # was reclaimed.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 00:53

some of the literals here could just be the qr_ enum tho

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 00:56

```cpp
if(s_version < 16 && get_bit(deprecated_rules, qr_COOLSCROLL+1))
{
    //addOldStyleFamily(&temp_zinit, itemsbuf, itype_wallet, 4);   //is this needed?
    temp_zinit.max_rupees=999;
    //temp_zinit.rupies=999; //This rule only gave you an invisible max wallet; it did not give you max rupies.
}
```
this is just nonsense tho. +1 is "NOSCROLL" but this has nothing to do with scrolling. What this _was_ is lost to time.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 02:00

ok i updated things to account for those two deprecated QRs being set (qr_BRKBLSHLDS_DEP and qr_OLDTRIBBLES_DEP). They are both used and need to remain.
