QR "Less Arbitrary Dock Combos" was off, when on it works.

1.92 has similar rafting code from what I can tell. I think raft would not activate there either. https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/777234dc570ed44473af9b364cc22e17b7a8373f/link.cc#L3095

But 2.10 seemed to ditch the `isRaftFlag(next(..))` check, and just activates raft always when touching a dock?
