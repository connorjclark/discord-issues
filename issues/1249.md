Note to self or @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) : check z1 disassembly. These keese are faster than the blue ones on NES

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/11/2021 04:46

Hmm...

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:37

blue keese max speed in the disassembly: 1f = 31
red/cset 9 keese max speed in the disassembly: 7f = 127
considering that the keese step speed in zelda classic is 62, i presume this means it would be 254 or 255
though, death knights only have 150... perhaps keese step speed needs to be recalculated?

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:40

```InitBlueKeese:
    ; Choose one of eight random directions.
    LDA Random, X
    AND #$07
    TAY
    LDA Directions8, Y
    STA ObjDir, X
    JSR ResetFlyerState
    LDA #$C0
    STA FlyingMaxSpeedFrac
    LDA #$1F
    STA Flyer_ObjSpeed, X
    RTS

InitRedOrBlackKeese:
    JSR InitBlueKeese

    ; Red and black keeses are like blue ones, but faster.
    LDA #$7F
    STA Flyer_ObjSpeed, X
    RTS```
that's sure sounding like it's setting the object speeds to be 1f and 7f respectively

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:42

yeah er, moldorms have $80 which would be 128
it's clearly not the same way of calculating step speed here

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:45

ok so $40 is 1 pixel per frame movement it seems

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 02:45

so $40 = 100 step

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 02:46

so take the input value `n`, and do `n / 0.64` to get a zc step speed?
0x7F = `198.4375`, so 198 step
....and `48.4375`, or 48 step, for the blue
I'd probably round those off to 50/200 for simplicity

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:50

```If the darknut is red, then move at q-speed $20 (0.5 pixels a frame).```
citation for what's a pixel per frame

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 02:52

eeyeah this doesn't seem right

the vire keese are faster but certainly not THAT much more so
i'll ask the randomizer community that has some hackers in it how many pixels per frame flying enemy speed results in

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 03:02

ok so i think what we need to do is
i need to know how many pixels per frame a keese step speed at max acceleration is
or preferably, what step speed would result in 1 pixel per frame
*in ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 03:07

100 = 1px/frame

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 07:22

Oh, so Red/Black Keese START at a higher speed, but have the same max speed as a Blue Keese

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 07:36

huh, odd

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2021 09:19

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I'd probably round those off‚Ä¶"): IIRC Blue Keese use a specific step speed that has a hardcoded side effect

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 14:19

Added a Keese (Fast) option to the list of Keese types
it makes them spawn at max speed but unlike bats still lets them stop slowly and start slowly like regular keese

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 14:26

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "IIRC Blue Keese use a specifi‚Ä¶"): oh?
also thanks, i'll try it out

(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìCSet 8 (Red)9 Keese Should Be Faster

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2022 05:39

It's a good effort, but it doesn't seem like they're as fast as they are on NES. Why do the red Keese seem faster on NES even though they and the blue ones have the same top speed?!?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 12:00

@ P-Tux7 all it does is start them with their max speed when they spawn
so if they aren't as fast, then that means that their max speed is higher than what the default quest has them as

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 15:41

(it also means that blue keese are also slower than they are in NES)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 15:42

oh, wait
hmm, red keese don't actually start at their max speed

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2022 18:38

oh i know, i made a test quest to try em out
sorry i'll upload it later

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 18:40

I think I figured it out
It's mostly just wrangling with the dumb way floater_walk is handled internally to add the features

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 18:41

@ P-Tux7 So I have two attributes, "acceleration step" and "acceleration frame delay"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 18:42

the first is how much step it increases the keese by when accelerating; the second is how many frames between each step increase there are
do you think that's clear, or is there a better way to name these?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2022 18:45

acceleration interval for the latter?
or maybe that for the former and acceleration timer for the latter

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 20:12

@ P-Tux7 was Z1 60 FPS?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2022 20:17

yuh
you've found a disassembly right

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 20:18

I used the one you linked, but reading the assembly is tedious cause I only half understand it
Just to confirm, Keese max speed are 3 pixels per frame, right?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2022 21:20

Uh I'll check once I get home
In the meantime I can give you the tip to set your Level to 4 in Buffet and give yourself a sword to easily test Vires
(Black Keese only show up in the second quest but act the exact same as Vire/Red)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 22:05

@ P-Tux7 there's no way their max speed is 3 pixels per frame
that's way too fast
even with the more gradual speeding up
(I can't check the buffet hack cause I don't have a Z1 emulator set up)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 22:07

even 200 feels too fast

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2022 22:07

you might want to join the reloaded randomizer server or the speedrun server and ask about it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 22:07

link?
hmm
100 feels just right though

I did do something with the default red keese; let me know if that feels right @ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 02/16/2022 04:01

thanks!
what was it specifically?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:02

I gave them a landing cooldown of 4 seconds
or was it 5? goldfish memory
so they won't try to land until after they've been in the air for at least that much time
they also spawn at max speed
