You know how, when you click and drag, the combo you have selected will just paint over the canvas. Well, with the new autobrush thing (where you can click and drag on the combo pane to make your brush bigger and for example place 2x1 combos now), doing click-drag just kinda smears it with an after-image appearance. 

The feature request is this: 

When your brush is larger than 1 tile, ZQuest will not overwrite combos you just placed while dragging. Until you let go of the mouse. So if you click and place a 2x2 combo, those combos cannot be overwritten as you drag the cursor until you let go of the click. 

The application for this is, I am using a floor pattern that is 2x2, and I wanted to click-drag to fill in the whole floor easily with a 2x2 pattern. 

Unless there's already a way to flood a screen with a repeating pattern of larger-than-1 sized combos then nevermind.

TL;DR when click dragging with combos larger than 1 tile, ZQuest will not paint combos until you have moved the cursor (BrushSizeX + 1 || BrushSizeY + 1) tiles, is probably a better way to describe it
