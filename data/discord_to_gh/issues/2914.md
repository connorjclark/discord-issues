If possible, this would be delightful <:nekosip:876927395666477086> For my case, I want to have followers that draw on layer 2 instead of the current dichotomy of either being under anything layer 1 or higher or drawing over overhead stuff

draw layer, instead of just `Draw Over` or not, would definitely be nice.
