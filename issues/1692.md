Program is hardlocked
`ZScript->Compile ZScript...->Edit`
definitely more urgent than #1690

`EditBoxView.cpp` line `364`: `vsync();` @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

Traces back to `a5_display.c`, `static void a5_display_vsync(void)`

It goes here
finishes that `while` loop
and then hardlocks on the call right after

....just commenting out the `vsync` call seems to work OK, though not sure if it looks worse framerate wise as a result or not

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/25/2022 00:42

yeah just delete it
or maybe use custom_vsync??

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/25/2022 00:43

It already has a call to `update_hw_screen()`
hmm
yeah, that does a similar effect as `custom_vsync`
I'm going to just abstract it out for now, incase we care later
because there are a fair few `vsync` calls
I'm not sure if they are all broken, though
which is
bleh
need to actually find where in the GUI they occur to check

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/25/2022 00:46

hmm, they don't all seem to hang

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/25/2022 00:46

yeah I'd just fix this one place, I havent' seen an issue with any other places. not sure if that's b/c it's not used often (maybe custom_vsync is more common)? 

looks like it's used more often in gui code?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/25/2022 00:46

there are calls in scrollbars
and those work fine
so I'm now just very confused

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/25/2022 00:47

i'll look more into this (before the alt stuff) saturday
for now deleting just the one in zscriipt buffer gui seems good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/26/2022 20:37

fixed, as far as I can see, soo
