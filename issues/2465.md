Like, let's say I'm moving to the right when I open my menu, but let go of right on my dpad before I can actually cycle through things the item menu. Once the menu is fully opened, it will act like I pressed right on my dpad. Basically, this makes using the menu a bit annoying if you don't let go of your dpad first because of this pre-emptive input that shouldn't be happening. 

Nothing happens if I press a direction while the item menu is being opened. only if I open the item menu *while* holding a direction in.

Version I'm using is the one in the image.

...yeah, makes sense.
not really sure this is a bug, this is just how input works
the engine subscreen is janky af and always has been
...may be fixable

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) There are replay checks in the spot directly related to this, which I don't understand why exist or what changes were made here
(`void dosubscr` in `zc_subscr.cpp`, checks referencing `load_control_state()` and `replay_get_version() < 11` or `>= 11`)
. . . . it looks like these changes would explicitly cause this issue, and should just be undone? but, I have no idea what purpose was behind these changes originally and don't want to break something.

I have a fix.
