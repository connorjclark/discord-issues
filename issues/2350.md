Having csets 1, 5, 7, and 8 be level specific is wonderful. With the addition of cets 12-13 as useable csets, would it be possible to have options for 10-13 to be level specific as well?

I can look into it
I still need to get my dev build set up
Which really is just a matter of "do I feel like doing this today?"
