``` case e1t5SHOTS: //BS-Aquamentus
        Ewpns.add(new weapon(x+xoff,y+yoff,z,wpn,2+(((dir^left)+5)<<3),wdp,dir,-1, getUID(),false));
        Ewpns.add(new weapon(x+xoff,y+yoff,z,wpn,2+(((dir^right)+5)<<3),wdp,dir,-1, getUID(),false));```
Found this code in the ZC source. This seems to imply that if Aquamentuses were capable of being set to have 5-Shots, they'd shoot them just fine, which is what I'm requesting to be added. All it probably needs is the option added

I'm not so sure about Gohmas and Gleeoks, but it'd be nice for them too if it doesn't take any extra code except adding those shot types to the list
Please enable 3-Shot and 5-Shot for all 3 of those classes in the next nightly and I'll test them to see if anything breaks.

I second this request if it's not too hard to implement at some point
