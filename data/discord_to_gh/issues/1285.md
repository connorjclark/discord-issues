Ex: I have a 4 frame combo, if i go into the combo editor when the animation is on frame 1, it is fine. But if I enter the combo editor when the combo animation is on, say, the second frame, then the preview will show that frame +3 (it doesnt know the starting frame is already on frame 2 so it goes off of the intended cycle)
