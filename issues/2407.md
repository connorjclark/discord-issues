I'm gonna need to know exactly how you have this set up
(either send the quest file, dm if you don't want to post it here, or screenshot all the tabs of the lockblock combo)

....huh. Ahk, I'll take a look later.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2023 00:15

....I'm super confused by this
I have no clue what's causing it, it's literally just trying to open the lockblock twice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2023 00:17

And, it only happens for lockblocks
not signs
despite that they are ***calling the same string display function***
so it has nothing to do with the string ITSELF

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2023 00:23

. . . and I just tried something to fix it for it being a timing issue but
it's not
hell
the timing is RIGHT NEXT TO SIGNS?
so
wtf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2023 01:37

Err, wait, hmm
it doesn't happen if you use a button to open it
only walking into it.....
fuck, this is a NEW MOVEMENT bug isn't it?
....no, no it isn't?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2023 01:39

.....no, no, fuck, I fixed this bug for the `Push->` flag on triggers and then DIDN'T realize it was also occurring in lockblocks/combos, and without a string playing, you don't really NOTICE that it was always trying to trigger twice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2023 01:40

hahahahaha
and I fixed it already on signs too
which is why that was different

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2023 01:56

yep, fixed.
