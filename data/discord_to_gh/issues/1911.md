I realize inserting tile pages would be very nice, but actually inserting _new_ tile pages might pose technical issues with file sizes or how tile pages are handled internally. My proposition is to add a feature which allows you to insert a tile page by bumping everything forward 1 tile page, and then eating the last tile page or swapping it in place of the page you insert.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/22/2022 23:52

That would be an incredible feature.  No idea how technical it'd be, but _boy howdy_ would that be nice to have.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2022 23:57

god dammit
I was about to say `you can already do this?`
but apparently only combos, not tiles
The technical issues this would pose would be the exact same ones that exist for `Move`, and tiles already have `Move`
To insert 1 full page
you just
`Move` everything after that page
down 1 page
so, it just needs an actual insert command

üòÆ

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/23/2022 00:05

no
that's so crusty
imagine being halfway in the middle of a tileset
and you wanna insert a page
you would have to move a bazillion tile pages to keep your organization

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 00:06

no
you don't understand what I'm saying
I'm not telling you to do it manually
I'm telling you that *that's what insert does*
that's exactly what pressing `i` in the combo editor does
it inserts a combo
which, means
it `move`'s every combo after that combo
that's the technical aspect of what `insert` does

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/23/2022 00:07

oh okay so you're just saying this would theoretically work the same way combo insertion does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 00:07

aye

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/23/2022 00:07

not proposing _moving everything yourself anyway_

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 00:07

no, that would be absurd
....though, it would work identically
because that is what insert does
(and, you technically CAN do it now, manually, if you really really really needed to
(no that does not mean moving pages one at a time either, you can select more than one page at once)

here have a quest
where I moved every tile page down by 1
manually
took me about 30-45 seconds

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/23/2022 00:11

How do you select multiple pages at once?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 00:11

(Select the first tile of the first page you want to move, hold `Shift+PageDown` until you are at the bottom of the last page)

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/23/2022 00:11

whoops

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 00:11

For some reason the mouse does not play nice with selecting multiple pages
but holding shift and using arrow keys/pgup/pgdn/etc all works
actually wait, what about home/end?
OH
OH
Select the first tile of the first page you want to move
and press `Shift+Ctrl+End`
to instantly select every single tile from there to the last tile on the last page
that simple

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/23/2022 00:12

That's not too bad of a workaround

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 00:12

then you just `copy`
then go back to the top

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/23/2022 00:12

I do think a button or something would be nice though because that is kind of a cryptic key combination

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 00:12

go down howevermany pages you want to add
and then `m` to move
I mean, it's not really cryptic
it's damned common

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/23/2022 00:13

just have zq automate that away, and it would be analogous to combo insertion

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 00:13

you can use the same combination in MS Word to do the same
or notepad
or chrome
that's a standard set of keyboard shortcuts
but, aye, an insert button is still worth adding

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/23/2022 00:13

selecting everything from the first tile, to some key combination that select the end of the tile pages, and then moving everything down some, is much less intuitive than just a button that does that for you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 00:14

I selected one letter here, then pressed `Ctrl+Shift+End`, and it highlighted all the text on the page below it.

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/23/2022 00:14

but I will concede for _now_ it's much more sane than
going through and manually moving each page one by one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 00:14

if it were one-by-one, I would never have suggested it
For the record, you can use this same 'highlighting multiple pages'
....and then hit `Recolor`
to recolor every tile in a quest
why you would want that, not sure
(mayhaps re-organizing your entire palette, and needing to fix all your tiles?)
and, if you ever did want to move a set number of pages
shift+PgDn is your friend
`shift+End` with no `Ctrl` will select until the end of the current tile page
and while `End` is used to go to the end, `Home` goes to the beginning

Holding `Shift` will `Remove` instead of `Insert`
Important note:
Previously, if you tried to `Move` tiles used by an enemy
it would yell at you that you're breaking the enemy
and it *would not automatically update the enemy's tiles with the move at all*
....so I had to fix that entirely
now it should be able to update *most* things
there are a couple of hardcoded things I didn't touch, so those will still give you issues if you try to insert/remove before them
....but they are all on the first tile page
so, unless you really need to insert something in the first few rows....
One major warning

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1022656365530984528/1025019177049796643/unknown.png?ex=65e9b0ff&is=65d73bff&hm=6ef42291d5dd9aa593141af62ab717547573e299fcb837bb0f36334efe125639&)
The red rectangular area is the area I have selected
The *green* area is the area it will `Insert` into
do note the warning that is added to the dialog that `Inserting tiles ignores rectangular selections`
....to do a proper rectangular insert would require multiple move commands, which would mean you couldn't `undo` such an insertion, and that's just a whole pain to try to figure out how to get to work

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/29/2022 15:43

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....so I had to fix that enti‚Ä¶"): thank god

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/29/2022 15:44

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "The *green* area is the area‚Ä¶"): Makes sense tbh
I feel like inserting a rectangular selection wouldn't make much sense in the first place
unlesss it inserted two whole rows, going by the selection you did
Awesome stuff, in any case
