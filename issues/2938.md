Not sure if it's a quest specific issue, but whenever I try to do a spin attack, I'm unable to move and the spin attack never comes out.   I can also change directions with the sword extended out.

I'd keep track of this thread here, because it may be this very issue or related.

=== @ Attempt 12/29/2023 09:50

nah i'm pretty sure that's a different issue, which will be fixed in the next build (i think)
idk what's going on there

=== @ Attempt 12/29/2023 09:51

never seen anything like that

=== @ Attempt 12/29/2023 09:55

can't replicate it either
might need to give one of the bug fixy peeps a copy of the quest so that they can investigate

=== @ Phosphor 12/30/2023 18:51

Could it be whichever movement system you have in the quest rules?

=== @ Joaish 12/31/2023 23:10

Ok, so it seems like the charge ring is the culprit here.  Having it on is what is causing this behavior as I can spin attack normally with it unequipped.  If I set the "Magic C. Duration" on the charge ring to anything above 0, then I can move around like normal but the spin attack won't actually happen when I release the button.  Worth noting I don't have any magic requirement for it either

=== @ Joaish 12/31/2023 23:17

also found this while messing around

=== @ Attempt 12/31/2023 23:31

that's super weird
is this your quest or a database quest?

=== @ Joaish 12/31/2023 23:43

This is my quest that I‚Äôm working on yeah

=== @ Attempt 12/31/2023 23:47

i'm big confusion, bcuz i still can't replicate the issue

=== @ Joaish 12/31/2023 23:50

That‚Äôs bizarre ü§î

=== @ Attempt 12/31/2023 23:51

oh wait
are you setting the "Charge Duration" higher than the "Magic C. Duration"?

=== @ Attempt 12/31/2023 23:53

because that seems to be what's causing it for me
which makes sense considering the charge duration affects the spin attack
and the magic c. duration affects the hurricane spin
so it's checking the hurricane spin before the spin attack
causing the whole charge to not work

=== @ Joaish 12/31/2023 23:54

ohh interesting, yeah charging duration is higher than magic c. duration

=== @ Attempt 12/31/2023 23:54

ye drop that lower than the magic c. duration and try it out

=== @ Joaish 12/31/2023 23:55

I put them both as the same number and that fixed the issue!
Awesome thanks for pointing that out

=== @ Attempt 12/31/2023 23:56

no prob, although setting them as the same might be weird, because that means they'll act at the same time when they finish charging, and idk what'll happen if ya have both

=== @ Joaish 12/31/2023 23:58

Good to know.  I‚Äôll probs mess with them more later

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 00:07

Ye the charge rings have always been quite janky.
Gotta be careful with em

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 00:44

being the same, I would expect it to never let you do a normal spin attack if you have hurricane spin unlocked
because the hurricane spin would finish charging at the same time as the regular spin
...interesting that it breaks when the magic charge is under the normal charge, though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/08/2024 02:50

Is there still a bug here besides the pit thing (which is tracked in Genny's bug report)?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/08/2024 03:03

aye, probably should make it so having a charge ring with `Charge Duration` longer than `Magic Charge Duration` does not cause this
