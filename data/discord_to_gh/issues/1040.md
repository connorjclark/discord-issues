I did a fresh compile of the scripts on Demo SP/ZX in Alpha 95, and I got a lot of lag on the scripts in Alpha 96 Nightly 3.  Not sure what to really do, no way to really track it down as of yet, but it was annoying me.  Comments on why it could be happening?  No errors on the scripts.

Latest nightly?

=== @ NightmareJames 09/23/2021 23:27

I was playing it on the latest nightly and compiled the scripts on Alpha 95
If you want me to recompile on the latest nightly LMK

What's  lagging specifically

=== @ NightmareJames 09/23/2021 23:28

It was like I was attacking enemies and throwing beams, and it was randomly lagging.  Couldn't really track it down

Try the compat QR for `Old (Faster) sprite draws`, see if that fixes it

Have it on already

Update:  Demo ZX isn't slowing down nearly as much in the newest nightly
I'm going to start to run SP tonight and see how it goes
