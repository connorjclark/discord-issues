We should add the ability to drag subscreen items like you can with freeform combos, so you don't have to mash the mouse button to get it where you want it.

While this makes sense, it also sounds like a nightmare with how cluttered subscreens get and how basic ZC's handing of dragging things tends to be. I already drag FFCs off grid by accident  all the time 😩
