I don't know what the exact cause of this was, but I've had crashes with this code block
```            int w = 16-activeFrames/2;
            int h = 32-activeFrames;
            int x = this->X+(16-w)/2;
            int y = this->Y-16+(32-h)/2;
            b->ReplaceColors(0, c, 0x91, 0x97);
            b->Blit(2, RT_SCREEN, 0, 0, 16, 32, x, y, w, h, 0, 0, 0, mode, 0, true);
            
            ++activeFrames;
            if(this->DeadState==1||activeFrames>16){
                TempBMP[bitid]->Create(0, 1, 1);
                this->DeadState = 1;
                Quit();
            }```
The particular problem seems to have been the `TempBMP[bitid]->Create(0, 1, 1);` after the blit (b and TempBMP[bitid] are the same bitmap in this case)

=== @ Moosh 10/20/2021 11:09

So changing the draw layer for Create() to 2, fixed it. My assumption here is that when I resize the bitmap (to flag it as freed for my temp bitmap system), it performed that operation before Blit() because of layer order and this lead to it trying to draw a bitmap smaller than I intended.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/20/2021 20:34

Aye, that's a script error. Shouldn't cause a crash, though...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:08

@ Moosh I can't replicate a crash in similar circumstances
can you provide a test quest where the crash occurs?

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:11

oh geez, I've so long since fixed the crash I don't know if I still have the full script that did it

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:12

I was sure it was specifically those two lines. It may also be to do with my temp bitmap global script, so I can try linking you that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:13

All I need is a way to make the crash occur
because if it crashes while linked to the debugger, it tells me the exact line that caused the crash

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:14

yeah I figured as much. And I figured just something along the lines of those two lines would do it because I'd narrowed down the cause to just that

I tried this, and a bunch of tweaking it totry to get it to crash
but it just doesn't

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:20

Only real differences I can think with my setup is the bitmap is very small (16x32) and the scale can sometimes be non integer. Can't see why that would crash though.
I'll try and see if I can reproduce it myself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:22

The scale there should be non-integer
and changing it to `1x1` should be enough, if that actually has anything to do with it

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:22

oh also it was running off a weapon script. Once again shouldn't have any impact on the timing or scale of the bitmap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:22

I'm just baffled that this is this elusive
I figured it'd be a quick fix

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:22

Yeah it seemed incredibly straightforward
I guess if it's rare that's a good thing

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:31

```global script Crashy{
    void run(){
        bitmap b = Game->AllocateBitmap();
        b->Create(0, 16, 32);
        
        while(true){
            b->Create(0, 16, 32);
            for(int i=0; i<32; ++i){
                b->Clear(0);
                b->FastTile(0, 0, 16, Link->Tile, 6, 128);
                b->ReplaceColors(0, 0x81, 0x61, 0x6F);
                b->Blit(2, RT_SCREEN, 0, 0, 16, 32, Link->X+32, Link->Y-16, i/2, i, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, true);
                if(i==31)
                    b->Create(0, 1, 1);
                    
                Waitframe();
            }
        }
    }
}```
Okay does this one crash for you?

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:32

better yet here's just the test quest I used

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:40

that crashes, perfect. Now for debug mode.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 22:42

well, it seems to be... where I would likely have expected, in general. Which makes me confused why mine *didn't* crash.

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2021 22:44

glad it wasn't some convoluted combination of my global systems at least

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 00:41

See, I thought Allegro was supposed to handle this for us, frankly, based on how everything was coded
and what I think is happening
....hopefully what I just attempted will fix it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 00:46

ah, it has
now it's just looping the animation repeatedly, never crashing
given, it's still an error on the script side, as the last frame it's drawing `1x1` instead of `16x32`
but, no more crashy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 00:50

building a release build now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2021 00:59

So, what I had to do to fix this
is, if `sx + sw > sourceBitmap->w || sy + sh > sourceBitmap->h`
it now creates a new bitmap that is `sw x sh` sized
clears that to `0`, and draws what is in-bounds from `sourceBitmap` to this new bitmap
then uses that for the draw
(so, anything "out of bounds" will read as "0", instead of reading as "crash everything")
