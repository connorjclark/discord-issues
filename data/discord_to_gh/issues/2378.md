I always had a hunch, but the hammer hitbox seems to be bigger than the hitboxes shown in the L4 cheat would seem to imply. You can clearly see that the boxes aren't touching at all.

Or to put it another way, the hitbox display of the hammer does not seem to align with the actual hitbox it uses when interacting with enemies

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 02:01

Yeah, melee weapons do be like that
if you want it not to then script a hammer
everything about every single melee weapon uses hardcoded bullshit
that means sword, wand, hammer, bugnet, etc
It's not "screwed up" or bugged
it's 100% intended
(and, making the display actually show correctly would be painful as absolute hell for the same reasons)

=== @ P-Tux7 05/22/2023 14:30

i mean i would call the display bugged

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 14:32

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "(and, making the display actu…"): ^
Case in point, melee weapons are hardcoded jank. Nothing about that will be fixed until they are rewritten entirely from scratch.

=== @ P-Tux7 05/22/2023 14:35

oh, this is why i asked
https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1093764232333508630/1095551541575958608
i thought the hitbox in the screenshots was accurate because it seemed to be triggering the combos
and i was like "wait, that doesn't seem right" so i tested it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 14:36

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "and i was like "wait, that do…"): Combos use an entirely different hitbox than enemies, both of which are different than what is shown

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 16:09

I could look at this maybe
hammer hitbox in ZC is huge

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 16:09

what would be your solution?
Like, rewriting the entire hammer?

*oh my*
*she's a mad lass*

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 16:11

not happening until after the expo though
the hitbox display being wrong could probably be easily fixed though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 16:12

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "the hitbox display being wron…"): which hitbox would you display

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 16:12

the hitbox that hits enemies

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 16:12

the script-readable one (what is currently shown),
the combo one,
or the enemy one?
three different damn hitboxes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 16:13

script readable one is useless if it does nothing besides being a variable storage
enemy one would be more consistent with everything else in the program; scripters might be confused but that's a small price to pay

=== @ P-Tux7 05/22/2023 16:18

oh so the hitbox being displayed IS purposeful? what the fuck?
i suppose the display should stay the way it is then since scripters would likely care about hitboxes more

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 16:18

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "oh so the hitbox being displa…"): It's displaying the hitbox that is `Weapon X,Y by Weapon HitWidth,HitHeight`

=== @ P-Tux7 05/22/2023 16:18

though yes a hammer rewrite with one hitbox would be much better, thank you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 16:18

same as every other weapon in the game does
(i.e. there is no special code to handle the hammer's weirdness)

=== @ P-Tux7 05/22/2023 16:19

yeah i was about to say the issue there is that with the other weapons that matches the enemy/combo hitbox lol
so that's why this shown hitbox had me going wtf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 16:20

Next question: is the sword correct??

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 16:21

sword is probably correct
Okay no, it isn't

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 16:22

So, yeah. Are you going to rewrite every single melee weapon?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 16:22

I don't need to
I just need to make the script hitbox match the actual hitbox
QR'd of course
which, I mean
I've reverse engineered the sword from the source into a script
I understand how it's hitbox code works decently well
