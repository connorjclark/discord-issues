What it says on the tin. Being able to set this would be nice for weapon balancing reasons.

The main thing that I see being problematic here is how to store how many it's already pierced
will need to find an open variable for that, or add a new var to all weapons
....but that's not that bad. And the item editor setup would just be an attribute.
