This was fixed w/ `c5d6f1 refactor(zq): Clean up Tile/Side/Ring warp dialogs`, however it requires `033396 refactor: Menus (new sleeker look, much cleaner backend)` for which there are too many open regressions to merge to 2.55 just yet:

Is there a simpler, alt fix for this? I can't work out what the array here is so idk what bound check to use.
