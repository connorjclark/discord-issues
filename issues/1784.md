From the latest version added on the evening of July 27th.

I just successfully compiled a script,  (Emily's Screen State assignment script she graciously provided for assigning strings to signposts.  Thanks again!)  and then went to assign it to a slot in the "Screen" tab, because I seem to think that's where it should go, (and it let me.) 

... and then when I hit The [ OK ] button, the Zelda 2 fanfare theme played, ... ...

... ... ... ...

and then, it seemed to just freeze.  Nothing happened.  Not even the cursor can move.

But I CAN hit enter to make things proceed.  Assuming I knew to do that.

So I guess there's a window somewhere that appears after hitting [ OK ] that doesn't quite move to the foreground to be seen, is all.

I see exactly where I fucked up
It's part of fixing the flickering that was happening when you clicked any button in that dialog
I needed to freeze screen rendering
but, I forgot that the OK button has a popup, so it needs to resume drawing before that popup
...and that's using an OLD gui, so the other thing I did recently *won't* automatically fix it....

Simple enough to fix, couple minutes I'll have a build
