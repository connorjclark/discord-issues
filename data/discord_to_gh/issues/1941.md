TL;DR at bottom 

Currently, right clicking on a combo and doing "replace all" ignores identical combos which are in different CSets in the same layer.

If possible, how about some combination of modifier keys and/or a confirmation prompt so that "replace all" affects combos of different CSets, but preserves the CSets?

If that makes sense. 

The mod keys and prompting can be dev discretion but I was thinking like, if you're holding down Ctrl (or shift, or alt) while clicking "replace all", all combos of the same ID are replaced on the same layer with their CSet differences persevered. 

Replace-All without any mod keys could bring up a prompt asking

[Same CSet Only] [All to own CSets] [All to Current]

```Maybe this is too convoluted for the benefit but at the very least, "(Mod)-Click while doing Replace-All affects all combos of same ID regardless of CSets" is the idea```
