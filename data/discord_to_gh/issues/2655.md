This video sums up the problem effectively

still have this problem as of the latest nightly. I was hoping some of the nightly changes would somehow fix this as well (kinda like how sometimes you can fix one bug and end up with a helpful cascade effect where a few other unrelated bugs get fixed as well by fixing one bug)

=== @ Moosh 09/22/2023 01:55

think you might've already said this before making the report, but is this 32 bit or 64 bit? And you're on windows 7 right? So this is likely another issue relating to that
More details are always welcome though. A video can't illustrate a problem we can't reproduce

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 01:58

What's the name of the quest file?
and the `zc.cfg` after trying this?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 02:22

it's ``C:\Program Files 2\ZeldaClassic\2.55\[-] Current Projects\(-) Myriad Worlds\Myriad_Worlds.qst ``
(I figured the directory info would be important too)
and what zc.cfg? There's only one zc.cfg in the main zeldaclassic directory

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:23

yes, that one
clicking the create init data button there adds to the config

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 02:24

I'll just hand you my cfg file
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1151435339416735786/1154604116211937353/zc.cfg?ex=65ea76e0&is=65d801e0&hm=d00d64cf1aeb06d8f0814e34e8cc03a7c93348041e8ce700095f93a724ebf6f1&

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:25

that... totally just didn't write to the config

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 02:26

perhaps it would be best if it wrote to a seperate cfg file instead

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:27

err, wait

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 02:27

@ Moosh And to answer your question, I'm using the 64 bit version of windows 7 and the 64 bit version of Zquest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:27

it would be `zquest.cfg`, wouldn't it
not `zc.cfg`

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 02:27

found it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:28

*OH*
(replying to @ FireSeraphim "it's ``C:\Program Files 2\Zel…"): it's the `[` and `]` in the path

=== @ Moosh 09/22/2023 02:28

lmao
that'd do it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:29

because config headers are marked with `[]`

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 02:29

I did that to have my current project folder be at the very top of the file list

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:29

and the path is inside the header
so it breaks it earlier
Use a different symbol

=== @ Moosh 09/22/2023 02:29

FS with the accidental formatting injection

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:29

and it would work fine

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 02:29

changing all that would be a logistics nightmare

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:29

usually `_` is pretty safe for moving stuff to the top
...otherwise, I'm not sure how to fix this with how it works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:32

....except that I can probably just filter them out?
gimme a minute

@ FireSeraphim does this fix the problem?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 02:46

Nope

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 02:51

. . . wtf
that uh, looks like it has nothing to do with the issue I just fixed
so, separate bug?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 02:51

perhaps

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/22/2023 06:13

Will need the qst and config to debug that particular error

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 08:12

hold on

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 21:09

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) check your dm

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/22/2023 21:13

I couldn't repro. Try again with latest nightly when it next lands. First remove any existing entries from ZQuest cfg.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/22/2023 21:15

aye

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/23/2023 04:27

It works now. Thank you @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/23/2023 09:23

You guys can close this now, connor's latest nightly fixed it
