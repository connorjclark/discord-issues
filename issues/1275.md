I have noticed certain overlayers are not covering objects such as when you start up my game, there is supposed to be a black overlayer over the character, and you can see the character through it now. That's not supposed to happen.

what layer is it, what color index of black is it

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2021 23:54

I am searching for that now hold on

Oh
Overhead (043)
is not functioning
where you make a tile Overhead on the tile itself
Not a layer
Just so you know, this was working in the previous Alpha

Hmm
I'll take a look

Also i cant test more stuff because of the doorway error in the other Bug report i made.
i use alot of doors in this quest.

doorway glitch is of course caves entry

Can confirm, Overhead type combos are not drawing over the player.
