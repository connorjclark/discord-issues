Having any corners of the cset2 box highlighted will "break" the rotated combo's flip values, resetting it to its original position as per the attached screenshots. It only happens if you're using a flip value of 4 (90 degrees rotation) or 7 (270); it isn't present on 0 (0) or 3 (180).

Using the 15th Feb nightly for this one.

Is there an in-game issue, or is it just the one tile preview?

Is this issue in 2.50.2? 2.53?

=== @ tacochopper 02/18/2023 11:27

haven't tested it in those tbh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2023 11:27

Need that tested, because cset2 hasn't really changed much

=== @ tacochopper 02/18/2023 11:27

will have to download and find out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2023 11:28

I would highly suspect a "yes", in which case this is a compat bug

=== @ tacochopper 02/18/2023 11:31

you are indeed correct
testing it in 2.53 now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2023 11:32

The easy workaround, for the record, is to use 8bit tiles instead of the complete and absolute jank bullshit that is cset2

=== @ tacochopper 02/18/2023 11:32

oh i ended up just rotating the tiles and setting them up separately

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2023 11:33

Or that lol

=== @ tacochopper 02/18/2023 11:33

lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2023 11:33

That's even easier

=== @ tacochopper 02/18/2023 11:33

ezgbz is a perfectly fine tileset with no cset issues whatsoever i mean what

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2023 11:33

XD
Anyway, compat issues (especially this easily worked around) are low priority at the moment; but it's on the list now, thanks for reporting!

=== @ tacochopper 02/18/2023 11:34

yeah of course! just thought i'd make sure it was reported at the very least

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/18/2023 16:58

(replying to @ tacochopper "testing it in 2.53 now"): What was the result?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/18/2023 18:09

What's garbage about CSet2 exactly?

=== @ tacochopper 02/18/2023 22:45

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "What was the result?"): Oh it was exactly the same outcome, definitely a low priority compatibility issue like Emily was saying

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:39

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "What's garbage about CSet2 ex‚Ä¶"): jank jank mcjank
and most of the time you need them, 8 bit tiles can solve the problem

Trying to upgrade everything to allegro 5 ( #2196 )
which had me looking at the drawing code for the combo editor tile preview
and I happened to find a way to fix this
....not putting a compat rule on it, hope that doesn't break anything ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 06:12

also multiple things about flipping in the combo editor were fucked up in general
but those are now also smoothed out

@ DeletedUser #deleted-channel

=== @ tacochopper 03/03/2023 11:38

looks good! üëçüèª

=== @ tacochopper 03/03/2023 11:46

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "also multiple things about fl‚Ä¶"): also what else? curious hahaha
