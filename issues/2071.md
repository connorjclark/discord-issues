In ZC, Fixes->Windows Midi patch. The description says that when the windows is moved out and back into focus, the midi should restart from it's last position (so as to avoid oddities with soundfonts when minimizing the program). However, the midi is restarting from the very beginning instead; I don't remember if it's always been like that or if it's a regression.

This is a *recent* issue
I just tested that midi pausing code a month or so ago when I made the `Midi Info` dialog able to `Listen` even in rooms with music
because I made it use the same code
and at that point, both were working fine

An important question is this "fix" still needed? The midi drivers have changed since allegro 5.

I mean, it's effectively an option to have midi pause when you tab out
which is nice to have
and, the same code is also used in the midi info dialog to let you listen to midis, and then resume the midi that was playing before
so, as long as those things work, we're good, however you accomplish it

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and, the same code is also us…"): What code is this?
When I disabled the `pause_in_background` and enabled this "midi patch fix", the midi is resuming from where it left off. Tried on Mac, about to try on windows now.
handled in `switch_in_callback` / `switch_out_callback` in zc_sys.cpp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/14/2023 05:16

`int32_t onMIDICredits()`, everything to do with `do_pause_midi`
interacts with the same code as the switch in/out callbacks

Not really seeing the issue as @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) described it, but I did notice this:

if `pause_in_background` is off, but the midi patch is on, and you do a screen scroll then lose window focus - the midi will pause, but then restart at the beginning when the screen is done scrolling. When you come back to window focus, the midi will resume where you left.

To resolve that ... thinking that `pause_in_background` should support 0 (do not pause), 1 (pause, but keep music going) and 2 (pause game and music). This makes the case of (do not pause game but do pause music in background) no longer something to handle.
But I'll need more specific repro steps to see the problem originally reported.
