First present in 117 and the newest nightly, if you are playing a quest with 4 selectable items instead of 2, and pick up your first weapon that fills a slot, it will fill multiple slots.

Quick to test in DuelingDragons.

Okay, I know there are additions to "Current Highest Level Item" in 117. Comparing the same quest in 116 and 117 / Newest Nightly is showing some.... concerning things.

Also, it happens in another quest that is just A and B selectable slots with a normal, non script item.

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Okay, I know there are additi…"): showing differently in ZQ is intentional
(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Nightly 9-02-2"): `View->Show Unowned Items`?
...which should be checked by default?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/04/2023 03:43

It.... is?
Except it's not toggleable.
If I select it to turn it off, it keeps the checkmark.
Also all the items briefly display for a frame or two when I do that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2023 03:45

the fuck
oh, wait, shit
...I already fixed this in my subscreen script branch didn't I
ffs
so, the ZQ subscreen thing will be fixed
the X/Y slots is a separate issue though, that's still open

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/04/2023 03:49

I was just checking the subscreens to see if I could figure out any pattern in which items auto fill a bunch of slots. Not every item does it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2023 04:27

actually @ HeroOfFireZC looks like that bug should have been fixed in main...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2023 04:29

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "If I select it to turn it off…"): so uh.... this was a bug that was happening before, but it was fixed, and it's still fixed for me, so it shouldn't happen in that nightly...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2023 04:35

in fact

literally first point on the changelog

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2023 22:10

I have no context here. @ HeroOfFireZC you still see this since the Sep 2 build?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/06/2023 22:33

Okay, there are sort of two bugs discussed here. One was the bug about Showing Unowned Items (more on that in a bit, I think there is still something broken about it and I'm trying to narrow down *what*). The post is that when I pick up the starting weapon in that quest above, it assigns that weapon to the A, B, X, and Y slots when it did not do that in 116.
And I'm testing in the 9/04 Nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 22:34

Do you have any counters or button counters on the subscreen?
If so, then the showing unowned items bug you had was fixed recently.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/06/2023 22:35

There are counters. Was this fixed *after* the 9/04 Build?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 22:36

Yes

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/06/2023 22:36

Okay, thanks for explaining that one, I was trying to figure out why some subscreens worked fine and others didn't.
Meanwhile I'm seeing if I can narrow down if specific items get assigned to multiple slots when others don't.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 22:37

The counter draw code was early returning without properly resetting a global variable
So it was overriding the setting every frame

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/06/2023 22:38

Wait a minute, I'm seeing something.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 22:39

The X/Y slots issue would be in `verifyBothWeapons()` somewhere (or something it calls)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/06/2023 22:39

...is it because the weapon is in Position 0?
In the *same quest*, the bug won't trigger if I pick up a different weapon, and that might be why.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/06/2023 22:46

Alright, I think I just narrowed it down.
Picking up a weapon that is in position 0 will fill all unfilled buttons with that weapon. This even happens in quests with just A and B selectable.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 23:04

Oh ffs, really?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 23:49

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> FUCK

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 23:50

think I have a fix

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 23:58

@ HeroOfFireZC does this fix it?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/07/2023 17:20

Seems fixed in latest nightly.
