When entering new keyboard controls, the menu appears unresponsive. On further inspection the buttons still work as intended, it just isn't showing the prompt to press a key, or depressing the button until the invisible prompt is closed

ah fek
was afraid something would be missing a call
it's updating the temp bitmap, but not getting written to the video memory because it doesn't have that call in some function
shouldn't be hard to fix, but not coding right now

Seems to work, though the build crashes if I leave the title screen
Assume there's some WIP stuff leftover in there
But yeah, popup thing's fixed

gah

TIL
`sprintf(buf, buf, ...);`, while it works perfectly fine in zscript, crashes in c++
