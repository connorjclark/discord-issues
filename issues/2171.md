Map 1, Screen 16 (0x10)
Start up the quest, type in the L4 cheat pleasetellmethecheat, then go one screen down and give yourself the ladder. Despite the fact that this screen's data shows that the ladder is allowed to be used both in ZC 1.90 and 2.55, the ladder is NOT working to cross the water when played in 2.55.

Thanks @ P-Tux7. Keep these coming.

No problem. Are you saying this was fixed or not? I just tested in the latest nightly and it seems not

=== @ P-Tux7 02/23/2023 16:05

I'd also have the fix code check quest versions including *and below* 1.90 just in case, as 1.92 quests seem to be where the issue resolves itself when playing quests in 2.55

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/23/2023 16:33

I didn't fix it.
