no no no
you need to set it to a clippings sprite

=== @ Phosphor 06/09/2023 07:17

Wait somehow use decoration sprite got ticked???

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/09/2023 07:17

`Custom Clipping`
not `Custom Sprite`

=== @ Phosphor 06/09/2023 07:17

I mean, what I did still worked once I unticked the decoration sprite box

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/09/2023 07:18

(replying to @ Phosphor "I mean, what I did still work…"): . . . ?
That would just be a `Bush->Next` with nothing custom?

=== @ Phosphor 06/09/2023 07:18

It's displaying flower clippings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/09/2023 07:19

what
. . . ahk, I see where the bug is here lol
the editor/combo wizard have a different idea of how these flags are supposed to work than zc does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/11/2023 23:31

I cleaned up this code, and tested to see everything working as intended, so
check in the next nightly

=== @ Phosphor 06/15/2023 06:34
