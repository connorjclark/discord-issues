A friend of mine recently thought of this

This is intended primarily for common items such as bombs, potions, and rupees that can sometimes be found as items or found in chests

bleh
it's already settable per screen, adding it per item would conflict
so it would need to work as some sort of override

oh, a 2.55 thing?
that ought to work, i told him

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "oh, a 2.55 thing?"): ....no.
2.50.2 lol

oh, i assume it works on similar logic for the secret sound?
(i do know that one is in 2.50)
