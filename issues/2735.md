On this screen, press "Default", then "Cancel". ZQ will crash.

confirmed, but, @connorjclark (discord: connorclark), even in debugger I have no fucking idea what's happening here

this makes no sense to me and I see nothing wrong here
err, well, the `zc_backend_palette` looks corrupted

boils down to this shit?

I don't have a single clue what the fuck to do here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2023 00:37

It's because `screen` is null here.

I'm guessing you were running this in RelWithDebInfo, otherwise this should have been what you saw too.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2023 00:38

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): This was ASAN, not RelWithDebInfo

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2023 00:39

wait hwo is screen null
weird

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2023 00:49

`popup_zqdialog_end` sets it to null after you hit cancel and that dialog shutsdown

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2023 00:51

via `screen = active_dlg_rti->a4_bitmap;` (a4_bitmap is null)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/13/2023 00:54

... Why is that null?
It should be the bitmap of the previous dialog

Not sure, seems worth looking into.

As for this specific crash, this patch seems ok
