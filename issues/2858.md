Can u add that, it would be cool.

Can only be used once until the player touches the ground again. 
Checkbox to toggle this.

Kills all momentum and the player falls straight down. Otherwise the player just has their sword out as they arc from the jump

Option: damage multiplier

Option: stun shockwave
