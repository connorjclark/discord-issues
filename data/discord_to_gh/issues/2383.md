bug "Fixes" itself when going back to normal windows, repeatable when enlaring

similar issue happens when you View Map

I'm assuming it's not accounting for forced integer scaling
(or whatever the setting is that has the letterboxing instead of stretching)

also funny thing: i found this bug 5 mins after downloading the game

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ""): That, uh, seems like that dialog isn't a real dialog
or something
...or, rather, the black square covering the background isn't part of the dialog

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/24/2023 13:29

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...or, rather, the black squa…"): it also draws over the map as well when it draws the map

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/24/2023 13:31

yeah, same problem
it isn't a dialog
so it doesn't understand that it should be higher
it should just need to call `popup_zqdialog_start()` before it does anything and `popup_zqdialog_end()` after

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/12/2023 16:12

ahk, should be fixed
the scaling being off was a fundamental problem with connor's scaling system (it was using the parent's base value instead of the parent's computed value, thus ignoring the parent's scale factor in a specific situation. Easy fix once I tracked it down, lol)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/12/2023 16:15

and the view map was just the dialog popup functions as I said

thank goodness, this was an eyesore, nice job
