Nothing too big hopefully but imma split each thing into its own message on this thread:

1) An extra SFX slot for when the hook hits a hookshot combo (THUNK!) <https://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/OOT/OOT_Hookshot_Target.wav>
2) An extra SFX slot for when it hits a combo that isn't a hookshot combo (clonk!) <https://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/OOT/OOT_Sword_Clang2.wav>

3) Strafing with the hookshot, which happens by pressing and holding the hookshot button. Behaves similarly to charging your sword and you can't turn around until releasing the button and the hookshot fires. This behavior toggled by item editor checkbox (or attribyte if there's no spare unused checkboxes)
(alright maybe I lied a little bit and that's a big one, but mostly I want the THUNK! and CLONK!)

3a) An attribyte field to specify frame delay of hookshot button holding before arming hookshot and going into strafing mode (turbo optional; a delay of 30-45 frames internally otherwise)

4) an extra SFX slot for the arming sound that signifies strafing mode is a-go <https://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/OOT/OOT_Hookshot_Set.wav>
and that's it I promise. gonna attach links to the specific SFX I mean to maybe illustrate things better.

5) Hookshot swinging in sideview areas, ala Indiana Jones and Super Castlevania 4.

wouldn't that just be the grappling hook from Wind Waker. and something like swinging in ZC seems herculean

bumping this just in the hopes that at least some part of this is at all doable. at least the extra SFX slots! <:utterdismay:947060167227342888>

items have 2 sfx slots, so more than 2 sfx on items would require an expansion
and strafing shit sounds like a nightmare
hookshots, in general, are a tangled mess of spaghetti bullshit that should never be touched

Fair enough
