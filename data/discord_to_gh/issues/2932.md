Alpha 120 2.55
Link will not exit the swimming state when he gets out of the water until he moves up, so if you exit swimming from the side, Link will still swim on the floor.

(replying to @ Tabletpillow "Alpha 120 2.55
Link will not…"): is `Disable LA_HOPPING` unchecked? If so check it.

Oh, that solves it. Never mind.
