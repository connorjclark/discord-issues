Last time I checked, if you copy and paste a screen, it only copies layer 0. If you use advanced paste or paste all, you can paste the layers, but it does this by changing the map/screen on the pasted screen to that of the copied screen. Would it be possible for a paste option that, when you paste to a screen that has layers assigned, it'll paste things from the relevant layers? 

Say you're copying a screen that has layers 1 and 2 assigned to a screen that has just layer 2 assigned (say from automap);  it'll copy the contents of layer 0 as usual, and copy the contents of layer 2 on the copied screen to layer 2 on the pasted screen without changing the map/screen values. Currently, if you want to do this, you need to find the layer screen, copy it, and paste it over the layer screen of the pasted screen.

This is a fantastic idea and one that I've also wanted to see implemented. Maybe you can think of it as "Move Screen", similar to Move Combo, which drags all the dependencies to the paste location.
