Sorry for word salad title.

I have noticed that - sometimes - after using `Graphics->Tint()`, scrolling warp palette shifting breaks for the remaininder of the current quest session. I have no idea why it happens only sometimes, but when something triggers this bug, it will always trigger it

in the above video, scrolling warps look normal at the start, but after the maze is failed (this uses a sequence of `Graphics->Tint()` calls to fade to black and then back to normal) scrolling warps look like... whatever that is

=== @ mitchfork 11/11/2023 06:33

it *seems* like calling `Graphics->ClearTint();` will prevent this from happening, so it's not a super critical bug I guess. But something seems wrong that getting back to a neutral tint value manually is causing issues

(replying to @ mitchfork "it *seems* like calling `Grap…"): until you clear the tint, you are not using the main palette, you are using a tinted palette (that happens to be tinted with +0,+0,+0 and no monochrome setting)

=== @ mitchfork 11/11/2023 16:05

Possible to note this somehow in the function documentation? I would not assume this is the case intuitively

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2023 16:05

or fix it so it detects a blank tint and treats that as a clear
probably smarter

=== @ mitchfork 11/11/2023 16:06

Yeah, that too
I can't imagine you would ever want this behavior

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2023 16:06

(replying to @ mitchfork ""): ...also theres the fact that tinting is fucking up this in the first place
.......for the record, you like, should really look at Moosh's `paldata` stuff as an ***instead*** of `Tint()` option
`Tint()` was... the second thing I added to the entire source, guided by Zoria, over 5 years ago

=== @ mitchfork 11/11/2023 16:08

Tint definitely has issues but for doing these warp transitions the drawbacks are pretty acceptable and it's waaayyyyy less complicated than paldata (since you'd have to write/reset two different level palettes, plus the main)

=== @ mitchfork 11/11/2023 16:10

Paldata is great for more more persistent changes though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2023 16:16

paldata also won't forcibly tint the ENTIRE palette
so like, you can spare the subscreen

=== @ mitchfork 11/11/2023 16:20

Yeah but there's still issues with that. Because you want to fade the sprite CSets (because sprites are on screen), which means that sprite objects on the subscreen will fade as well
So sparing the subscreen would also require redundant sprite CSets as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2023 16:21

(replying to @ mitchfork "Yeah but there's still issues…"): ...true
either redundant sprites, or not tinting sprites
so, depends on what your goal is for tinting

=== @ mitchfork 11/11/2023 16:22

Yeah, in this case it's an appropriate use of it I think
