Having trouble passing arguments into a generic script's run function. Given the following script:
```global script active
{
    void run()
    {
        genericdata gd = Game->LoadGenericData("foo");
        gd->InitD[0] = Rand(1, 10);
        gd->Running = true;
    }
}

generic script foo
{
    void run(int bar)
    {
        printf("bar %d InitD[0] %d\n", bar, this->InitD[0]);
    }
}```
bar returns 0 and InitD[0] returns a value. Tried with running set both before and after InitD[0]. It's just not working. This seems to have contributed to my pegasus boots script breaking
