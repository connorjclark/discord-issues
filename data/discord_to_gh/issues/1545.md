```
int Weapon;
 * The UseWeapon property for this weapon. 
 * If set to a value greater than 0, all collisions with npcs
 * will use this as if it was the weapon's ID for calculating
 * the defence value for it. 
 * e.g., if a LW_MAGIC weapon is set to a Weapon of LW_BRANG, when it
 * collides with an npc, the npc will use Defence[LW_BRANG] to resolve 
 * its effects.
 *
 * Some weapons will also trigger map flags, and screen combos as
 * if the natural weapon was the value set as ->Weapon.,
 * e.g. If you set a LW_BRANG weapon to a ->Weapon of LW_SWORD,
 * it will cut bushes. 
```

Weapons changed to ``LW_BOMB`` do not use the bomb defense. Instead they use the defense of the weapon it was created as.

`LW_BOMB` is the physical placed bomb
did you try `LW_BOMBBLAST`?
