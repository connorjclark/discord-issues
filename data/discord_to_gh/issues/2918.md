Both name and help stayed in the 2nd slot as shown above. Has done this a few times but just remembered this time to make a report for it

Purely a cosmetic issue tho. Doesn't affect functionality

huh.
Weird.
Must not be clearing the data somehow?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2023 20:03

...yeah, it definitely just isn't clearing when it loads that lol
the metadata just ghosts over
anything present in the new metadata overwrites, but anything not just stays
ez fix
