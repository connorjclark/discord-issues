Link instantly re-enters the cave or stairs upon exiting.  The warping tiles shouldn't be active until link steps off of it.

is this overworld or dungeons?
or both

=== @ cbailey78 12/17/2021 23:09

It's both.

=== @ tim 12/17/2021 23:09

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) I feel like this sounds like something you might have touched?

=== @ cbailey78 12/17/2021 23:13

@tim That's exactly where I discovered it.  I go into the cave to get the sword and as I leave the cave, link instantly re enters the cave leaving me trapped.  This is definitely game breaking bug.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/17/2021 23:20

hmm
I'll look at it

=== @ cbailey78 12/18/2021 01:18

I hope it gets fixed soon

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/18/2021 01:42

I am very confused
I see nothing apparent in recent changes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/18/2021 01:42

I'll look into it when I'm done doing stuff, it'll be easier to debug with the debug build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/18/2021 02:03

Whatever caused this is newer than Nov 29th

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/18/2021 02:43

bah fuck this is mine

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/18/2021 02:44

lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/18/2021 02:50

it was cross-screen respawn
I missed a variable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/18/2021 03:00

should be fixed
