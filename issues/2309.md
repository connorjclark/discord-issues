Sometime since the February 11 Nightly, the special character for Newlines in the debug console changed, causing the allegro text file to be much less readable as it does not recognize this special character as a newline.
A log from Build 113

This.... does not make any sense whatsoever?
"The special character for newlines in the debug console changed"
....no, no it has not, the newline character is the newline character, as it has been since ASCII was invented.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 02:46

This legitimately sounds like impossible nonsense, because what you are saying is simply impossible
so, for it to actually be happening... leaves me having no fucking idea
Also, it's only affecting the script's messages?
why would it not affect the rest?
like WTF

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 02:47

Yeah. Output text files are fine.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 02:47

This is legitimately like you said `Trace(2+2) printed 5`

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 02:47

And I did both of those today, so it's not some dumb OS update thing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 02:48

If you take the broken file, and do find+replace for `\r?\n`->`\r\n` in Regex mode, does it fix it?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 02:51

Replacing `\r` with `\n` does not fix it. Replaces other lines, but not the stuff from Traces
Hold on, could there be a filter for special characters when writing to allegro.log and it's not actually writing the Newline characters now for some reason?
Yeah, if I move through the text with the arrow keys, there isn't any delay from selecting a hidden character, it's like the newline character isn't even there.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 02:54

Wait a minute....
Is the actual bug `TraceNL();` no longer places newline characters in allegro.log?
Is there a new script option I don't know about, let me check quick.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 02:56

oh god TraceNL? I forget that exists....

but, uh, it very directly traces a newline character to allegro.log directly
nothing about this has changed in years

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 03:02

Weird. On a whim I added a `\n` to one of my sprintfs, and that properly newlines allegro.log. So it's not `\n` that is suddenly not working...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 03:03

Did you recompile it for both builds?
What happens if you compile in the build that worked, and then run it in the build that didn't work without recompiling?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 03:05

I first noticed the bug in a quest compiled in 113. I also had a quest from 107. Both have the same issue.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 03:06

ok, so it's nothing on the parser side
....I have no fucking idea.
This is black magic

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 03:06

The only good news is I can narrow down when it first broke by going through the older builds I had.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 03:07

If you can get me the exact nightly that it broke that'll help

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 03:07

2-11 was the last nightly where there was no issue. Next nightly I had (that runs) is 2-25 which was broken.
(2-24 kinda didn't run so I can't count that one)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 03:10

Check 2-14, 2-15, 2-16
and I swear to fucking god if it works in 2-14 and not in 2-16 I'm going to need to stab someone
...and if that ISN'T the case then I have no idea what it possibly COULD be, so either way I need to stab someone

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 03:12

Oh, I can narrow down a bit further since 112 was the "2-21" build in a sense. So it's before that where it became broken probably.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 03:12

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Check 2-14, 2-15, 2-16"): ^ This is the main thing that needs testing.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 03:23

It's not broken in 2-14...

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 03:27

Works fine in 2-15...

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 03:31

GOT IT. First broken in 2-16

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 03:33

Sounds like you need a new knife.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 03:37

So to refine the bug report. It appears `TraceNL();` no longer prints the newline character to allegro.log as of Nightly 2-16. Whether that is the actual bug of just what it looks like is to be determined.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:06

@ HeroOfFireZC test this. I swear to fuck I will be so confused if this works, but it's the only thing I could think to try. Also, it was a 5-character change to a single line.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096214863384170548/1096285235500556398/zelda.exe?ex=65ea8eb0&is=65d819b0&hm=afdb08fe8063db35c1adbe41b22cabee2ca491439a8e9ce298ef9f697593e4b3&

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 04:17

That worked. What in the world was that 5 character change?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:18

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> I changed the function it was calling from `al_trace` the normal function, to `safe_al_trace`, one of our functions.
what the ABSOLUTE SHIT

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 04:19

Let me guess, safe trace filters out `\n` in some manner

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:19

no,no,no
safe_al_trace prevents buffer overflow
because al_trace crashes the program if you give it too big a string
but safe_al_trace can't do printf-style parameters, like al_trace can
<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> I'm gonna need to do something a bit more fancy, because this fix just fixes one singular spot, but something deeper is broken here.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:21

For the record, the thing that broke this was when I fixed Yuurand.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 04:22

Well, when it's broken it appears it doesn't put any character at all into allegro.log, so.... do what you will with that knowledge.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 04:23

Also if `\n` is part of a string passed to `TraceS();` it appears in the log fine. It seems specific to this TraceNL(); scenario.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:24

Yeah, because `TraceS()` already uses `safe_al_trace`
as does `printf`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:27

Basically what I'm thinking is whatever I did with safe_al_trace, it completely fucked over normal al_trace
so I need to re-do what I did there, but, differently- putting the function directly in the damn allegro legacy files.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:30

...............oh
I see what was wrong, fucking dammit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:32

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> See, the problem here, is that I'm not connor.
because connor would have *known* the issue here, at an instant glance
since he set up the whole allegro legacy setup in the first place
I still need to learn what the fuck I'm doing with every change to it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:34

and, as it turns out, half of the fucking normal al_trace *isn't even running*, because it's doing a damned callback to a custom function ALREADY!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:35

....which, in short, means I dun fucked up by not doing a more thorough look into these changes when I was fixing Yuurand.

...to be fair to myself, *I was fixing Yuurand crashing and burning everything*, so I was very much in emergency patch mode

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:44

hah, found this comment on the handler code:```
//Fun fact: Allegro used to be in control of allegro.log. This caused
//problems, because it would hold on to a file handle. Even if we blank
//the contents of the log, it will still write to the end, causing
//lots of nulls.

//No more!```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:58

@ HeroOfFireZC That took way to long to get compiled... but here, hopefully this works?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096214863384170548/1096298416574840842/zelda.exe?ex=65ea9af6&is=65d825f6&hm=3c815039cf64042cea62afa607f9666ad99cfa030464f8f318c994fb429715ab&

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 05:01

Looks good, and now I assume it's using al_trace correctly?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 05:02

I undid the patch I had done previously, yeah
now safe_al_trace is using the proper handler call directly, instead of doing the bullshittery it was doing before.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/14/2023 05:05

This certainly was a trip. I guess al_trace wasn't used many places so unless someone just so happened to be using TraceNL(); and looked at allegro.log *before closing the launcher cause that changes the contents of the log file* it wouldn't go noticed.
