Since light beams don't draw fast enough to trigger the combo until after scrolling, it would be nice to add a flag and attrib for the `Light Trigger Combo Type` for a trigger delay (if unlit, n frames lit until triggered; if lit, n frames unlit until untriggered)

the light trigger code is a nightmare and this idea sounds like pain to implement
