This is a somewhat complicated issue. Some arrays in custom classes just don't seem to be working properly as they should.

This image is a dump of the array in question, as it was initialised by the engine.

The 1 on the right means it returns valid instead of null.
the 15 is the pointer it has in the engine.
the -1's are what is returned by looking at the data... sort of

this is the error code that prints when trying to read said values

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 12:39

err, no class array should be a positive number
class arrays are negative

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 12:39

well, this one isn't, for some reason?
so maybe that's the issue?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 12:40

if the array pointer value is `> 0 && <= 4096`, it's a local array
`>= 4096` is global

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 12:40

this is as it was created when the class object was created, I didn't do anything with it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 12:41

Try tracing every variable and array value at the start of the constructor?
are any of the variables initializing to negative instead of 0?

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 12:43

yes
those are the three int arrays

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 12:44

so, they are tracing correct there?
huh

it's still returns 15 when I'm trying to check the pointer
hold on.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 12:46

"when I'm trying to check the pointer"?

when I'm tracing the arrays later
as seen here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 12:46

let me see the code that's generating this output

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 12:47

```

        Trace(Active->Initiative);
        Trace(Active->TurnOrder);
        Trace(Active->ExpPool);
        Trace(Active->MoneyPool);
        Trace(Active->DropPool);

```
vs the constructor
```
    Battle(){
        
        Trace(Field);
        Trace(Song);
        Trace(TurnCnt);
        Trace(DmgNumbDisplay);
        Trace(NumbDisplayClr);
        Trace(Initiative);
        Trace(TurnOrder);
        Trace(ExpPool);
        Trace(MoneyPool);
        Trace(DropPool);
```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 12:48

Is that all that's in the constructor? (If not, does removing everything else in the constructor still give the issue?)

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 12:49

commenting out everything else in the constructor did solve it, now it's returning the same pointers
question is why
because the constructor shouldn't do anything with those arrays...

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 12:56

the constructor calls another function in the class, after that the array pointer changes. Said function does nothing with any of the arrays, however...

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 12:57

said function is a void function that creates objects of another class, that's all it does.

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:02

okay
entering the function is fine
the first thing that happens in a switch case running
once inside the switch (before it actually does run any other code), now the array pointer is broken.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 13:08

what the fuck?

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:08

yeah
I'm trying to pinpoint harder what is actually causing this
it's weird af

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 13:08

Well, now that you've traced that back, can you make a simplified script that is as small as possible while still causing the issue?
the smaller the better

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:08

I'll see what I can do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 13:08

(no rush at all, still no internet so can't work on my desktop at all)

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:09

I'm trying to replicate it

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:14

spawning another object seems to cause it???
```
        Trace(Initiative);
        
        switch(ID){
            
            case 1:           
                
                Trace(Initiative);
                TraceS("^ Before combatantt spawn");
                Combatants[10] = new Character(1, true, 0);    
                Trace(Initiative);
                break;
```

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:16

yeah
I tried creating one earlier in the constructor, same issue
let's try with another object type...

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:18

but not just any object causes it...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 13:19

fucking hell, fun
more object this pointer garbage
I thought I fucking fixed this... twice already....

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:20

hmm
oh
actually that's a good point
I should double check this on latest
if you've already fixed something similar

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 13:20

unless you're like 6+ months out of date I doubt it

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:20

I'm not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 13:21

still fair to try on latest, but probably not already fixed

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:21

but it might be good to check anyway

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 13:50

well
I can't recompile but
without that it's the same issue at the very least

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 14:23

why can't recompile?
recompiling seems... kinda important here

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 17:46

yeah I tried to make work arounds to the issue
by instead calling the function that creates other objects (of the different flavour) *after* the constructor was finished by calling the function in the script that creates the object.

This worked in salvaging the array pointer, sort of. But now when I write data to that array it corrupts other objects
I'm sorry that I can't provide a more clear cut file that just has this issue
but at this point I just fucking had it with this crap.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 18:02

(replying to @ Mani Kanina "by instead calling the functi…"): Writing data to the array after the fact corrupts other objects???!!!?

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 18:12

yes
so it would seem
I don't fucking know at this point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 22:00

marking fixed per it seeming to be fixed in our discussion
