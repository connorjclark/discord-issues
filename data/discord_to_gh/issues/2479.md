Basically, I'm asking for a feature where you by script can call/write to, a playback slot for music.

If there's any data assigned there, then the engine will keep playing that music track, regardless of movement between screens, dmaps, etc.

Basically a priority music channel. As long as you don't turn it off or un-assign it to a default then it will keep playing.

This would prevent awkward code like setting the music track on all relevant dmaps and then later having to set them back.

It would also open up more doors for those who want to manage audio playback themselves.

This sounds blatantly smart and like a "why doesn't this already exist" type thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:41

I would probably do this with:
-`bool Audio->ScriptMusic;` to toggle it on/off
-`int Audio->ScriptMidi;` for the midi
-Get/Set Enhanced Music functions matching the ones for dmaps for a `ScriptMusic`
With the functionality that, when enabled, it plays the script enhanced, with the script midi as a fallback (same way setting enhanced+midi on a dmap works)

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/04/2023 09:35

Yeah, that sounds smart

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 16:30

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I would probably do this with‚Ä¶"): @ Moosh gonna bump this at you as well, directly related to what you're working on

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 16:31

Ooh, so some kinda music override
One of the less fancy suggestions, but a good one nonetheless

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 16:33

figure this should be simple as hell

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 16:33

Would this make more sense as a separate "slot" or a boolean that prevents the engine from playing new music though?
Because the latter is dummy easy and serves pretty much the same purpose

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 16:33

it could just be a boolean *internally*?
or
I mean, however you think is best tbh
I have no room to speak when it comes to sound
(don't use it as a user, don't code it as a dev, so)

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 16:37

At the most basic level a flag makes sense. Though I also wonder if it wouldn't be better suited as an int. Something like:
0: Normal engine behavior
1: Update on DMap change
2: Update on level change
3: Never update

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 17:20

Enums are always better than booleans in interfaces that can't change, even if you currently can only think of two options!
Those options all seem useful
But maybe should be a bit flag?

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 17:22

Perhaps? In all cases I can think of one state implies another
If it updates on level change it will also update on dmap change. If it updates on dmap change, it will update on screen change

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 17:23

Ah, then enum is good then

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 17:24

Now one thing I could do with flags, though, is have a flag for "revert on change"
This way if you have update on dmap change and the dmap changes and that flag is set, it will revert back to 0

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 17:26

So that way you could override engine music changes for the duration of time the player is in the dmap and then it auto reverts to normal behavior so the user doesn't have to handle that themselves
I could see that being useful. Unsure how useful

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 17:33

Thinking more generically, can we just fire an event on dmap change?

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 17:41

I'm pretty sure that's already an event
Reason this feature was suggested was to be a one line shortcut to things that changle music for an entire dmap

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 17:46

In that case, something in stdlib headers that sets up an event listener for that is less cumbersome on implementation
No need for ZASM commands
And can be iterated on later without breaking compat
I actually don't know how event listeners work, got an example?

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 17:55

Have this script I used to make enemies that die when colliding with Link

the thing with events is that they have to be run from a generic script that's just dedicated to handling events. So it's not the kind of thing you can run from a function.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 17:57

Oh. Now i want to do my callback thing üëÄ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 18:01

yeah, event handlers go through generic scripts
generic scripts were basically designed for `I wanna do some weird, overly-specific, fucked up scripting shit, that isn't really related to any types`
like:
- Specific Timings (`WaitTo`)
- Events (`WaitEvent`)
- Frozen script menus (`genericdata->RunFrozen()`)

=== @ Moosh 08/03/2023 09:04

This seems to be working nicely enough.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 09:05

*yooooooooooo*
(also I vaguely might exist in PZC vc if you care to join)

=== @ Moosh 08/03/2023 09:07

How it works is you set Audio->MusicRefresh which has four different levels:
MU_SCREEN, MU_DMAP, MU_LEVEL, MU_NEVER. And then there's two flags that can be ORed on

MUF_NOCUT: Makes it so warp types that normally cut out music (such as Entrance/Exit and Cave/Item Cellar) do not
MUF_REVERT: Makes it so things that do trigger refresh will revert the value back to MU_SCREEN

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 09:07

*yooo*
I would probably make it `MUF_NO_REVERT` instead so that the default is reverting on engine resetting something

=== @ Moosh 08/03/2023 09:08

There's some limitations I foresee. Various things in the engine besides warping can change music still, like some of the NES rules

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 09:08

. .  .excuse me nes rules?

=== @ Moosh 08/03/2023 09:09

Yeah, like hold up stops music. I believe that'll use the DMap music when it returns

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 09:09

oof
should definitely try to fix that

=== @ Moosh 08/03/2023 09:09

And while I could make it use the currently playing music...don't wanna. Too many potential cases to overlook üòõ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 09:09

is it really that complex?
I only see 2 nes rules that would affect this

=== @ Moosh 08/03/2023 09:10

Actually hmm...That's the only one I thought of because I assumed there'd be more. But are there
Oh yeah, picking up a triforce

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 09:11

hmmm
I'd make that a third `MUF_MCGUFFIN` flag [`Overwrites McGuffin music`]
(triforce is McGuffin now)

=== @ Moosh 08/03/2023 09:12

Would we want to override it? I guess that wouldn't be too hard. Was more thinking about restoring the old music on warp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 09:13

override would want to be a flag for sure
restoring after makes sense as well obviously

=== @ Moosh 08/03/2023 09:13

I'm gonna consider this, but I think I'm also just gonna commit what I have right now instead of staying up another five hours again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 09:13

yeah lmao that's totally fair
is this in main or your music branch?

=== @ Moosh 08/03/2023 09:14

Music branch

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 09:14

ahk then, wonderful

=== @ Moosh 08/03/2023 09:14

Figure better to keep anything involving music together

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 09:14

(if main was gonna say to branch it until you cleaned up those loose ends, but already in a branch)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2023 02:21

this like done and working? should mark thread closed/added if so

=== @ Moosh 08/21/2023 02:41

ah yes it is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2023 02:42

@ Moosh #deleted-channel you can feel free to close it properly then

=== @ Moosh 08/21/2023 02:43

whoops, forgot tor emove Moosh tag cuz it was at the bottom of the list

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2023 02:43

üëç
