Currently, there is no way to place an FFC with any id except the next id. It would be nice to be able to place an FFC with a higher id, especially if you’re doing carry-over shenanigans or have a script that’s intentionally hardcoded to access certain id’s

oh, err, wait
I'm stupid @ DeletedUser
...just use the actual FFC menu?
F7
completely forgot about it when you asked lol, my bad

=== @ ChefBear 12/19/2023 23:24

Yeah I guess I was thinking in the context of specifically placing it on a layer other than layer 0
Cuz to place on a higher layer you have to do Edit New FFC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/19/2023 23:25

err, huh? FFCs don't go on layers
...(If `Edit New FFC` is placing ffcs on layer screens instead of the current screen, that's 10000% a bug)

=== @ ChefBear 12/19/2023 23:26

Could have sworn I did that for a couple interior screens for chairs. I’ve already left so I can’t check until I get home whether I just checked the flag for draw over, but I’m p confident I actually put them on diff layers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/19/2023 23:26

...which it absolutely isn't doing

=== @ ChefBear 12/19/2023 23:26

But yea I’ll check later and let ya know

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/19/2023 23:27

just checked, it doesn't
and if it did, they wouldn't show up on the screen in zc
because ffcs on layer screens don't ***exist***, are not drawn, do not have collision, etc

=== @ ChefBear 12/19/2023 23:27

That makes sense actually
I forget too often that layers are not on the same screen heh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/19/2023 23:28

so yeah, just use the f7 menu
