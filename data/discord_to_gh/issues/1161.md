Here's a strange one. I have a screen with water along the right side and a cancel warp on the left. When trying to scroll off the left side Link gets stuck in a walking animation as if trying to enter the water. When the water is removed the issue goes away.
The most baffling thing though

wtf

=== @ Russ 02/12/2022 01:57

This is still occurring, by the way

Quick test quest

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) Cancel warps interact *how* with the 'see the combo on the edge of the next screen' function?

=== @ Russ 02/12/2022 01:58

It only happens if "New Water Collision" is enabled
Disabling that rule fixes it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 01:59

My guess is the cancel warp runs as though you are scrolling onto the same screen
in the same dir
so it's running the water scrolling code

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 13:20

ugh
hate that

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 13:27

(replying to @ Moosh "The most baffling thing though"): So scrolling screens still sets LA_HOPPING, the QR doesn't prevent that and I'm unsure if I want to have it prevent it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 13:49

actually, wait, fuck

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 13:50

it's an issue with x not being bounded properly

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 14:11

fixed

=== @ Russ 02/13/2022 05:12

Excellent, thank you
Let me do a quick test to verify it's dead

=== @ Russ 02/13/2022 05:14

Unfortunately it appears to still be happening

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:15

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 09:05

what the hell

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 09:58

(replying to @ Russ "Unfortunately it appears to s‚Ä¶"): I'm gonna need more info

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 09:59

(replying to @ Russ ""): I'd guess this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 10:00

cause the test quest that was sent earlier (as well as an expansion I did just now that tests cancel warps on all sides and the natural cancel warp going off the map) is fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 10:00

Hmm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 10:00

at least for me anyways

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 10:00

Did you not push something?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 10:01

I pushed everything I had before I went to bed
and this is fixed with a recompile I just did having pulled everything
lemme test if the same test quest breaks in the nightly you posted

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 10:03

wait a fucking minute
Yeah okay I'm just a dumbass

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 10:04

What

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 10:04

I fixed it for New Hero Movement but I missed the code block for non-new movement
so it still happens if that's turned off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 10:04

Ah
Fun

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 10:07

...why didn't I just edit the function to vbound it for me instead of editing every single argument passed in? v.v

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 10:09

okay yeah I'm gonna revert my original fix and just do the simpler fix cause I don't know what I was thinking lmao

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 10:12

actually fixed now

=== @ Russ 02/13/2022 14:42

lol
Yay
