On the left, the Z3 branch (labeled 8-25), on the right, main branch (Labeled 8-28-2)

This is also a mechanical bug because the question marks on the right side are no longer clickable. This only affects the first tab (ZC Player) 

Also! Since the title screen stuff got removed, the dropdown for choosing the style is still there.
