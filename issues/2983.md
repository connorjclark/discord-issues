When you select multiple combos in the combo pane to draw them, it draws a white box around them. But when you press alt + select to only select the combos for 1 placement, it is still a white box but it used to be pink instead (as far as I remember). Placement works just fine, it's just a visual bug.

(replying to @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) "When you select multiple comb…"): ...nope, the color is always the same afaik
you can change what color it is in `etc->options` though
