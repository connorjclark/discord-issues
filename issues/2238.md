It appears the compiler isn't recognizing setting constants to other constants and setting default values in functions.

Given that std.zh compiles fine for me, I'm gonna need more info @ DergerSwerson
....oh, huh, it failed compile on mac and linux but not windows, apparently

...oh wait, no, it failed on windows, but that didn't cause a test failure?
and it isn't failing for me
wtf
...ahk, rebuilding made it happen now

...ah it's only broken in release builds
