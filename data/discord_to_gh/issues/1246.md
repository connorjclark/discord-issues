So here's one of those buggy blind spots I recently noticed. When moving FFCs around in the editor, they get caught along the edges of the screen despite being able to be positioned out of bounds. Then when you release it, it gets placed at a random-ass position. So for example, I dragged one off the top of the screen and it got flung to 189, 247. It's like the Y value when being dragged was a byte and it underflowed. Oh fuck that's exactly what's happening isn't it?
Anyways, this is one of those editor quirks I've just sorta gotten used to, but it probably is a bug the more I look at it

Pahhahaha yeah that's exactly what's happening
should be fixed (now will bound it within the screen)
same code used for several things `dragging`, like blue squares and such

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíWhat the heck even happens when you drag an FFC off the screen?
