clicking/dragging in this area sets the warp point; kinda annoying cause that space is used by side warps for settign A/B/C/D per screen edge and it's easy to accidentally click this phantom zone that sets the tile warp.

these dialogs were reworked to fix this problem

I have the december 2nd nightly of 2.55

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/09/2023 00:47

guessing this isn't backported to 2.55, needs to be

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 01:32

For the reason mentioned here, I don't want to backport until the related regressions are fixed. Can you work on some of those?
