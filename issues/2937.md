On this one specific screen, whenever I place secret flags on layer 3 they show up fine in preview mode on the editor, but then in ZC the layer 3 secret combos do not show up at all.  Also, when I turn off the editor and go back the layer 3 secret combo flags and secret combos are not there anymore.  I also tried to do this on layer 4 and nothing showed up at all.  I've not had this problem with other screens that involve secrets on other layers so far.

(replying to @ Joaish "On this one specific screen,‚Ä¶"): does placing a single combo on the layer (even combo 0) fix the issue?
...if so, something probably just isn't setting the screen's `mVALID` flag when placing *flags* on the screen...

I placed one random combo on layer 0 and then even put a different transparent combo all over layer 3, it still didn't work.  However, I went to the actual screen the layer is using and it was showing up blank despite it not being filled with combo 0.  So, I filled the screen with a non-transparent combo, then re-replaced it with the transparent combo and now it works üôÉ Does feel like it just wasn't considering the layer screen as active (probably bc I didn't have anything else on the layer)

What you're calling "active", is the `mVALID` flag I mentioned.
The bug here is that placing flags on the layer (obviously) didn't set the flag
A screen is blued out if the valid flag is not set, and all data for such screens is ***not saved to the quest file***
