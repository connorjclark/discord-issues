For instance, if you place multiple Enemy0 flags (ID37) on the same screen, the 1st enemy in list will chose one of flagged spots at random to spawn upon  screen entry. This will make at least usable to place multiple flags for same enemy slot in list. As for now only first such flag is used, regardless of others.
