`int` has a legal range of "-214748.3648, 214748.3647".  However, the parser will enforce a range of "-214747.9999, 214747.9999" and truncate legal values
this is... an incredibly small bug

not a bug
intended behavior
and changed in *2.55*, with compiler options
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/878114935396257852/882002144692166677/unknown.png
2.53's legal range is `-214747.9999` to `214747.9999`
(meta) thread name was changed: ❌🔒[2.53] Parser will truncate ints and floats early
