In the screenshot, ZQ is showing the desired string while ZC adds in a ^ to the string. The bug can be avoided easily by positioning the leading space after the color code instead of before, also preventing the code from being converted to that long string of extra digits and backslashes.

yeah, that'd be because you had the number as part of the string control code
> The bug can be avoided easily by positioning the leading space after the color code instead of before
^ That's correct
not a bug

=== @ Phosphor 05/30/2023 01:35

Yeah, but why the disconnect between what's shown in ZQ and ZC?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/30/2023 01:36

not sure, but you have incomplete control codes, which is never good
that's not a bug with the program, it's a bug with what you've put in the string

=== @ Phosphor 05/30/2023 01:45

The control code was what ZQ spat out when I reopened the string. The original string had a different control code
And whatever ZQ changed it to resulted in the ^ in ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/30/2023 01:50

(replying to @ Phosphor "The control code was what ZQ…"): you can't put another number touching a control code
by doing so you changed the control code
and made it wrong
the `^` is a default character that appears for some garbage values

Ahh that makes sense then
