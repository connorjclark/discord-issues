Armageddon Quest 2 made use of a bug where you could hit gohma from seemingly any direction; I assumed that the issue was that the first hit on gohma always hit it regardless of direction or eye state because of an uninitialized variable and made a compat change based on this, but testing it in 2.10 this appears to not be the case, and I appear to have overcorrected and introduced buggy behavior that was not there before.

Need to figure out the exact cause and what versions it appears in.

I just made some improvements to the bisect script that may help you here.
Assuming the change you're looking for is somewhere on main branch.
