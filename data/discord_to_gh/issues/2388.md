I lack the knowhow to adequately describe the issue, so see the videos below demonstrating the bug in action and the intended behavior under identical conditions in 2.50.2. Included are versions of the quest for 2.50.2 and 2.55, with identical setups. Note the 2.55 version has more work done, hence sending two different files. See the exact 2.55 version info below:

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) @ Moosh adding to thread

=== @ Phosphor 05/25/2023 23:29

Apologies for the stumbling trying to get 2.50.2 to cooperate on modern hardware. It kept lagging and eating my inputs trying to open the cheat menu midway through the video.

=== @ Phosphor 05/25/2023 23:31

Anyway, see map 8, screens 03 and 13 for two examples of NPCs affected by the bug

=== @ Phosphor 07/10/2023 00:09

This one

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 19:07

Okay, so the problem only happens when recompiling in 2.55
the issue here appears to be that you're not using the latest version of Moosh's dialoguebranch script

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 19:10

the original version was bugged, but for whatever reason still worked despite the bug in 2.50
but in 2.55, it breaks when you recompile

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:24

oh, was this the integer division bug?

=== @ Phosphor 07/14/2023 19:58

Thankfully a lot of what that script does is possible with SCCs now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:01

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "oh, was this the integer divi…"): integer division bug?

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 20:02

To this day I still do variable * 0.5 out of habit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:05

wh
okay *something* is fucky

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 20:06

I think the bug I fixed had to do with negative array index access

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:06

(replying to @ Moosh "I think the bug I fixed had t…"): this script has the whole thing that was checking for the code_br in every thing

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 20:07

Or well "fixed", I don't think I actually fixed it because people've still been having issues

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:07

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) it's not to do with that quest setting. Neither havign it checked or unchecked (recompiling both times) fixes it

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 20:07

But the problem was that I copied the same check in different places and if it didn't find the string it'd access index -1, which with new 2.55 settings became the end of the string

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:07

however, f6ing seems to fix the bug??

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 20:08

uhhhhhh
okay I got nothing then

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:08

Like if you load the quest via Quest->Test, it won't work
but if you f6 and hit continue, save, or retry, then it suddenly works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 20:09

does continuing or saving in test mode work?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:09

any option you pick in the f6 menu
it's specifically when you boot it up via Quest->Test for the first time that it breaks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 20:10

...so this is a test-mode only bug, specifically on first load?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:10

...but *only* if "Disable accessing negative array indexes" is checked; otherwise it just always breaks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 20:12

...ah, fun.
That rule makes sense completely with what Moosh was saying- that's an error in the old script, not a bug on our part
....it not working right on test mode initially, seems pretty buggy though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:13

it is a bit weird that the rule wasn't *on* considering compat

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 20:14

(...not weird if they did the bugfix thing to disable compat rules?)
oh, but it's a zs rule
so only if they specifically checked to do zs fixes, huh
interesting
....applying the modern ruleset or something would do it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:15

wait, there's a check to do ZS fixes?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 20:15

yeah, not in the auto-popup though (IIRC)
only if you actually go into `Quest->Options->Pick Rule Templates`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:16

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I think the negative array index this just isn't compatted at all
I loaded up the 2.50 version of the quest, and it had a bunch of stuff checked, but not that.
...I don't know why I'm pinging you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 20:17

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I think…"): huh, that should have been.
still doesn't explain test mode issues

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:20

I wonder if quest script rules aren't applying when first launched with test mode...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:22

It's not just test mode

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:24

it also happens when loading the quest normally; f6 continuing fixes it, but returning to the file select menu unfixes it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:30

well that would explain the lack of compat

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 20:35

ah
well
looks like I thought of this already lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:39

found the problem
```can_neg_array = !get_bit(quest_rules,qr_ZS_NO_NEG_ARRAY);``` this is called in FFScript::Init, which is called *before* the quest is opened and the rules are read

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 20:42

AH
that's poor timing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 20:49

So I'm having the thing also be set in readrules in qst.cpp
Would it only apply if keepdata is true or should it apply always? I'm not entirely sure what keepdata does
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1111435560310018069/1129515124915453962/image.png?ex=65eb79ef&is=65d904ef&hm=8b96adc5c2564584bdabdeaa35d8dc670ae5f8d0fa36ea5c012092199ec3a809&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 20:55

keepdata is false for like tile grabbing
so probably only with it true here

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 21:12

okay, maybe not the best place to put it given ZQuest also uses that function
think I'll just put in the same function that calls FFCore.Init, but after the quest is loaded

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:13

....probably just do it in `init_game()` after quest load, yeah

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 21:20

Fixed.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 21:24

@ Phosphor the fix won't automatically apply to your quest; you can apply this fix by going to ZScript->Quest Script Settings->Instructions->Disable accessing negative array indexes (it's on page 2 of instructions). However, all this fix is doing is reproducing the buggy behavior the script used to do, and you're likely going to run into further issues with the script as a result of the script's bug; so what I instead recommend doing is redownload the script as Moosh has updated the script to fix the bug in question.

=== @ Phosphor 07/14/2023 21:56

I'm currently not utilizing it now, but I will if I decide to reimpliment it
