Unsure if this is a crash or what, but I left an unfinished block of code lying around and it caused ZScript.exe to close without giving me an error. The offending line was
```(timer[0]%8<4)?66821:66822```
Just that. Any syntax error seems to do it though.

Okay, I can see red text for a fraction of a second before it closes. So it is at least reporting something. Just no way to read it

I'm also noticing these errors don't have line and column numbers any more. Even if I take a frame perfect screen grab before it closes, the error isn't all that helpful

hell it doesn't even report which _file_ it's coming from
I could've typo'd anywhere in this project and if I don't remember every thing I changed since last compile, I'm shit outta luck

(For the record, nothing *should* have changed...)
(so, fun times!)

Got things compiled, fixed the syntax error issue
but I had noticed that one of my example quests for a script didn't compile or give any errors
Fun times
I added a config (not in any gui, but in zquest.cfg) that allows you to force the console not to close
which is useful for debugging, here....

Ah, beautiful fix

It was not printing errors for files not being found

So, this SHOULD all be fixed?
