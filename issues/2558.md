In the same conceptual spirit (But not the identical functionality) as how Strings have a "Next" button, or how FFCs have an ability to copy and edit a next piece, an ability to be in a Life Gauge Piece subscreen item and click a button and duplicate every single setting of that particular gauge piece except the following:

1)  It would appear eight pixels to the right.
2)  It would increase its gauge piece by 1.
3)  It would save the current piece you're working in and go directly into the next piece, editing it.

So the result for the user would be that by clicking that one button, they wouldn't even have to move the mouse to lay down a number of Gauge pieces to the right of the current one.  They could just click once, and the next piece in line would be created automatically with the appropriate settings.  The "Next" button would still be under their cursor, ready to make a new one again.

If they want a new row, they can click once, exit _that_ new piece, drag it to the new row, and then click the "Next" button another 8 times.

This would save _hours_ of work, maybe.

This is similar to something we discussed for the subscreen upgrade, except rather than duping pieces and incrementing the meter, it'd be a wizard that just generates the whole meter for you

Neat.  Would the wizard handle the x/y positioning of the meter area as a whole?  I'm curious what the optimal control of automation versus ease of development ratio would be here.

=== @ Moosh 07/30/2023 13:02

I imagine it could have an X/Y position, but it could also default to selecting the whole thing after creating it so you can position it yourself
Could probably also have a "starting container" in case you're expanding an existing meter or just doing general shenanigans by having part of it invisible

@ Changeling so, uh, no need. Gauge pieces can now just ***be a grid of gauge pieces*** instead.

I figured as much.  I saw that and rejoiced mightily on the spot.  You're done incredible work with this, Emily.  Absolutely incredible.
