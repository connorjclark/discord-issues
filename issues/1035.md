This is from a discussion in the Z-Zone scripting discussion channel with @ Lejes
In `__AutoGhostParseName()` there is a for loop to go through the NPC name string - there is a `return 1;` line that will always execute before the for loop finishes
this messes up AutoGhost in 2.55

....and it doesn't mess it up in 2.53?

=== @ mitchfork 09/21/2021 17:04

Haven't checked the file in 2.53
It looks like it would have the same bug
seems like to me that the `return 1;` should be inside an `else` but I'm not certain
line 351 btw

....wtf

=== @ mitchfork 09/21/2021 17:09

yeah, I use ghost heavily but don't use autoghost so I never encountered this

No, this occurred in an update of zoria's
where he royally fucked up without testing

should be fixed with that update

Could someone test this? More bugs I can close, the better
