Title. Would speed up tile editing.

As in when in the tile editor but only when selecting a region with the hookshot tool? Could be good
If it's always active, maybe a bit far fetched but I could see myself fat finger it when changing CSets

Hookshot tool or the magic wand tool

Heck, in fact, are the number keys even used for anything while editing a tile?  If not, they may as well select a color.  Shift + 1-5 would select the rest or so.

that would also be extremely nice
It'd be funky with 8-bit mode, bvut at the same time 8-bit mode is kind of a niche case

Adding stuff to the tile editor isn't 'easy' by any stretch
but delete is simple enough, and it's done.
