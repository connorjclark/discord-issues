After pressing the m hotkey to map a block on tiles to combo space, if you press escape key while on the combo page you can cancel out of mapping the combos. As soon as you select a combo position to map to however, you cannot cancel the action. The cancel button in the combo editing popup does not actually function as a cancel button.

This is really annoying if you happen to press M by accident and hastily press enter on that combo page screen. It'll map whatever you had selected to the start of the combo table, overwriting it. This cancel button worked properly in 2.53

So someone made `bool edit_combo()` return true always, even when you click cancel
