This would work similarly to CopyTile() and similar functions, but be sourced from a ZScript bitmap. I imagine arguments would look something like:
`BitmapToTile(bitmap b, int x, int y, int dest, bool eightbit)`
It'd always copy in 16x16 sections from the source bitmap and if 8-bit is turned off, would merge the colors into one cset by index like in the editor. Hopefully the internals of CopyTile could do enough heavy lifting that the latter part isn't especially difficult. If not I wouldn't be against assuming 8-bit in all cases. But yeah, this would be handy for paper doll systems, switching out large graphics banks from external files (would probably require a loading screen) and just generally give ZScript total access to the tile page.

Tile stuff uses *pointer math*, so it's always a huge headache to comprehend what *anything* is doing
which is why this hasn't been done already
but, this is certainly something I'd like to add at some point

so
so
uh
this was way too easy

All 17 of those tiles are blank at the start, and nothing ever changes what tiles are being displayed, nor is there any copytile usage.
Bitmap drawing to tiles magic
```cpp
void WriteTile( int layer, int x, int y, int tile, bool is8bit, bool mask);
 * Writes a 16x16 area from (x,y) of the bitmap at layer 'layer' 
 *     TO the tile page, overwriting the tile 'tile', either 4 or 8 bit.
 * If 'mask' is true, overlays instead of overwrites```

Splendid. And it's updating in real time too? Looks excellent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:10

Obviously it has the same restraints as CopyTile
in that it won't carry over between reloads and such

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:10

No copying to blank tiles I assume

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:10

?

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:10

Though IIRC, flagging a tile as 8-bit makes it no longer treated as blank

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:11

why would you not be able to write to blank tiles

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:12

Beats me. Been that way as long as I remember. I kinda figured it had something to do with how tiles are compressed. Though in hindsight it may just be a bug ü§£

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:12

is that an issue with CopyTile?

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2021 07:12

As far as I can tell yeah
Didn't try with the other variations
And haven't tried it yet in 2.55 to be fair

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:13

I see no reason that should be the case
either for copytile or for this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 07:16

..and uh, in fact, the tiles in the video were 'blank'
so
