Minor issue, but in the topleft of the window, there's supposed to be an icon, and in Alpha 107 it's the ZQuest icon, but in 108 it's the generic window icon
topleft is 108, bottom right is 107

ah fek, probably an issue with the icon update
better the generic than the copyright-infringing
but bleh
