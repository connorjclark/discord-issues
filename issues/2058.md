I get a message shown in the pic when I launch ZQ or ZC.

what is this old launcher? Can you try to run it more typically, like a fresh install?
32 bit, 64 bit‚Äìany difference?
What windows OS are you on...
help me out here üôÉ

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/30/2022 00:19

oh, don't use the old launcher
we have a new one
we've had a new one for quite a while

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/30/2022 00:23

Anyways... that seems to be related to the scaling code. Searching this error, it's possible that command is windows 10 or above specific?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/30/2022 00:24

if so, that's a bit of a problem

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/30/2022 00:27

I figured someone would have reported issues with it by now though...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/30/2022 00:29

looking from the taskbar, that looks like windows 7
given DPI scaling apparently became standard around windows 8, that'd make sense
so perhaps the command is windows 8/10/11 exclusive?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 00:58

It is, I will add an os check for it
Like what allegro does.
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "I figured someone would have‚Ä¶"): Why? I just added it last night with render refactor

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/30/2022 00:58

oh, I thought I added it back when I did scaling; sorry, my memory is hazy

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 00:59

Allegro calls a similar API but they first check it exists / grab it dynamically
You called a much older api
To get the default device details

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/30/2022 00:59

ohhh, makes sense

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 01:09

(meta) thread name was changed: GetDpiForWindow missing in dll for older than win10

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 03:22

Fixed for next nightly.
