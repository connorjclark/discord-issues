not sure if this is intentional. basically if you enter a stairs combo, and still hold up while you're being warped, it'll ignore the solid combo and allow you to scroll up. not sure if this is because of the way i have my warp point set up either so i've attached a screenshot showing the set up i'm using

in saying that, this doesn't happen with the smart scrolling QRs checked. was present in the june nightlys as well - was something that got picked up during testing a little while ago.

Is this the same as https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/996950533552214087/996950541286514781 ?
I identified the problem code there but we never fixed it.

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) this happened to me before and I reported a long time ago. This was when I came up the idea for generic warp combo types @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @ tacochopper 10/17/2022 03:40

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Is this the same as https://d…"): looks like it is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2023 21:39

bump

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 13:30

Ah
So, @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
the specific issue was that it was subtracting 16 from the y, which yes, made it negative
....but then it got `& 0xF0`'d
while negative
which threw everything off
It being negative was not actually scrolling, as it would be made positive by the end of the loop
due to the animation
though, that's only the walk-down issue
which....actually seems to be separate from this??
(the walkdown issue scrolled you *down*, not up...)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 13:51

so, yeah, two separate but similar issues
this one is actually newer, it's a rounding issue with new hero movement it looks like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 13:54

seems to be fixed
@ DeletedUser @ vlamart
(test in next nightly)

=== @ tacochopper 02/23/2023 13:56

shall test and get back to you with updates

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 13:56

aye, once the nightly goes up

=== @ tacochopper 02/23/2023 13:58

of course

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 14:58

should be up shortly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 19:04

@ DeletedUser

=== @ tacochopper 03/03/2023 11:41

.... hm. this is funny and kind of funky.

=== @ tacochopper 03/03/2023 11:43

so, two screenshots here. using warp return C. 

the warp return where the y is 0 (right hand side) is absolutely fine. having the warp return y set to 8 (left hand side) still causes the bug to happen lol

=== @ tacochopper 03/03/2023 11:44

also latest nightly, upgraded after i saw the pings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/03/2023 12:27

oh, yeah, of course the entire A5 ui doesn't show in screenshots lol
thought I had tested that though....

=== @ tacochopper 03/03/2023 12:45

got another bug for ya too, one sec

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 03:04

I fucking
apparently accidentally *reverted* part of the fix in another change

@ DeletedUser https://www.mediafire.com/file/zrcr98ye83jmf8e/zc.zip/file
#2214 and this report should both be fixed
(For the record, the problem with the scrolling is subpixel)
(because, small hitbox means your top 8 px don't count)
(so, at y = 0.0001, your hitbox y+8 is 8.0001, which is WALKABLE)
(going up then checks offscreen, which says "oh yeah you can walk there, that's a scroll!")
(...so now when moving up, upleft, or upright, with small hitbox, if the new position would be offscreen, it checks the same position at y=0 for solidity and if it finds it prevents the movement)

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 03:14

yeehaw
it all works!!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 03:15

woo
