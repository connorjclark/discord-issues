Should be fixed hopefully?? Will definitely need a test (next build)

I noticed this also happens upon exiting the entire program during an opening wipe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 14:54

Yeah, because it was writing the quit state to nothing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2023 01:18

should be fixed in the build that just went up @ Phosphor
