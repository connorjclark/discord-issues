No idea how feasible it would be to do this since the subscreen editor is scary, but it would nice to be able to have either the entire overlay or preferably just a single object within the overlay disappear or hide upon entering a dmap after a set number of frames.
The use case for this would be an alternative to dmap entrance strings that are less intrusive, as they wouldn't freeze the player in place, and the ability for the entrance string to be significantly more customized graphically.

An example of something that behaves similarly would be the text that appears in the middle of the screen upon entering an area in basically every mainline Zelda since OoT,  treated as a graphic instead of a string

@ Phosphor This should work for your purposes. Except, I found some bugs while writing it! So, it'll require the next nightly to work properly. (which I'm about to post, @ Moosh ?)

neat. I'll definitely play with it and see what I can do

=== @ Moosh 09/21/2023 02:58

ah sorry. had a headache and went to take a lie down. New nightly's out then?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2023 03:03

yep yep

=== @ Moosh 09/21/2023 03:05

neato

=== @ Moosh 09/21/2023 03:06

except my changelog didn't work?
did I typo something obvious in it?
oh nvm
mooshblind
previous changelogs weren't sectioned in a foldable block so I just missed it

Oh, did you not preview it with the script before committing lol?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2023 03:49

`python generate_changelog.py --from nightly-2023-MM-DD --format markdown > foo.md` will output it (pick the MM-DD for the most recent nightly) into a file named `foo.md`, and you can preview that in github just by editing a markdown file somewhere and clicking preview

=== @ Moosh 09/21/2023 03:50

good to know.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2023 03:51

(the `> foo.md` just being cmd talk for "take the output and put it in this file instead of to the console)
(since it's `>`, it will erase anything already in the file; `>>` would append to the end of a pre-existing file)

Oh! I know how it could be done
You know how there's a setting for item sprites to not animate after they reach their last frame
If the same is applied to subscreen widgets, you could just have the last "frame" be blank

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "You know how there's a settin…"): ...there's what?
