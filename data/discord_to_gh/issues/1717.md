This setting is no longer applying properly to scale the window.
#1716 is higher priority, as that will work around this issue a fair bit.

The scaling stuff in ZQ does not work on my monitor because I get one of the following:
1) A tiny window at 1x
2) A scrunched up window that my monitor does not properly work with on 2x
3) Irregular pixel size at any sizing between which throws me off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 19:04

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) this would be really good to devote some time to if you have it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/22/2022 19:09

Tell me everything about your monitor and resolution you use
What does scrunched up mean / look like
And does full screen work okay or is that broken for you too

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "https://cdn.discordapp.com/at‚Ä¶"): ^This needs to work, is what it comes down to
from windows `Display Settings`

How it looks can be seen from this link

=== @ Orithan 07/23/2022 07:10

My scaling is 150%, my monitor resolution is 1920x1080
My monitor refresh rate is 60hz

=== @ Orithan 07/23/2022 07:14

Full screen _works_ but not without caveats like it screwing up the window sizes of a lot of other programs that are open because Windows 10 jank

=== @ Russ 07/29/2022 19:26

Ack, sorry for ignoring this. Lemme compare alpha 107 with the newest nightly to show off the issue
ZLauncher 107:

The player, running at the 640x480 setting:

Meanwhile, ZLauncher as of the newest nightly:

The player at the same 640x480 setting:

The player can at least be manually resized by dragging the corner now, though it's really obnoxious having to do that every time I start it
The launcher cannot be resized or moved at all, which I think is a separate issue, see here: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1002657953498804316
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "And does full screen work oka‚Ä¶"): Full screen works fine
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Tell me everything about your‚Ä¶"): Gonne refer to the earlier picture I took that Emily linked: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876908472728453161/995053709291688006/unknown.png
The monitor is my laptop's built in monitor. The resolution is 3840x2160. I use that resolution setting in Windows, with the recommended 250% upscaling
Said upscaling seems to be at the heart of the issue here. Pre-A5 builds respected that. Post-A5 builds do not.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2022 19:47

As a work around for now, can you just set the scaling to what you want it to be in z launcher?

Thanks for all the pics I'll look at this eventually

=== @ Russ 07/29/2022 19:53

No, the scaling does not go high enough
The largest setting in Zlauncher is still smaller than the 640x480 size in A4

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2022 23:20

(replying to @ Russ "The player can at least be ma‚Ä¶"): you should be able to adjust `resx`/`resy` manually in zc.cfg
and that should specify the window's starting size
...zcl needs to be updated to handle the new res options
. . . also just got this https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/issues/792

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/01/2022 19:01

*bump*

=== @ Orithan 08/31/2022 23:59

Bump. This is still a very significant issue and drag to scale does not work.

=== @ Orithan 09/01/2022 00:10

Please fix this ASAP. It's entirely screwed up the workflow of myself and multiple others and we cannot work or play quests using these builds until the window scaling is fixed.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/01/2022 03:16

err, I just went to test this @ Orithan
and it looks like ZQ is respecting the windows scaling to me
...it looks the same as just resizing it up, though, it seems?

...frankly, even 125% is too tall for my monitor, lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/01/2022 03:20

but it does appear to be respecting the windows scaling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/01/2022 16:06

@ Russ can you confirm if this is still an issue or not?

=== @ Russ 09/01/2022 16:41

I‚Äôll check when I‚Äôm home

=== @ Russ 09/02/2022 10:34

Problem still persists in the newest nightly
Including Zlauncher being unreadable tiny, unresizable, and unmoveable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2022 10:35

yeah, that definitely needs to be fixed....
The windows scaling percentage works for me, though
sooo
