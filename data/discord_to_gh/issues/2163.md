I could've sworn this was a thing already, like how you can disable click to freeze on a quest by quest basis using a script. Every time I write a script that uses the mouse pointer I look for this setting, fail to find it, then just draw my own pointer. I think it'd be handy to have anyways because it would mean the look of the mouse pointer could be more standardized for quests that use it and UI elements that are standardized are pretty cool. Also the default mouse can be scaled by a user setting to be more or less visible while a script drawn one cannot.

Good idea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 06:06

OK, so...
```cpp
int Game->MouseCursor;
 * Which mouse cursor (ZCM_ constants) should be displayed during gameplay.

void Game->SetCustomCursor(bitmap b, int fx, int fy, bool sys_recolor = false, bool user_scale = false);
 * Sets the custom cursor based on the given bitmap. This cursor will be displayed if `Game->MouseCursor == ZCM_CUSTOM`.
 * fx,fy denotes the "focus point" of the cursor. For a normal cursor, this is usually the top-left (the engine cursor uses '1,1', which is the transparent pixel directly pointed to by the arrow). For a crosshair type cursor, this would be the center.
 * If `user_scale` is true, the user's mouse scale config will apply to the custom cursor.
 * If `sys_recolor` is true, some special colors will be replaced based on the current theme.
 -0xF1 = Cursor Misc
 -0xF2 = Cursor Outline
 -0xF3 = Cursor Light
 -0xF5 = Cursor Dark
 * WARNING: The palette will NOT update on custom cursors automatically. You must call this function again if the cursor should be affected by palette changes.```
How does this sound, @ Moosh ?

oooh
I like
Hadn't even considered this possibility

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 06:08

(updated explaining the params)
...I think I have this working in-engine side, though hard to test the custom cursor part. The options `ZCM_NORMAL` and `ZCM_BLANK` are also available, giving the normal system cursor and no cursor respectively- those I have tested.
Haven't touched the script access yet

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 06:10

Oh, err, I need to give you access to set the damn mouse focus point, lol
completely overlooked that

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 06:11

Focus point? Meaning the part that actually does the clicking?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 06:12

yeah, like, if you have a crosshair, you want the center to be the focus point, not the top-left

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 06:12

time for a cursed quest with a mouse pointer that draws to the upper left of the click point

My test works. I would show a screenshot but the cursor isn't captured, lol

That's really cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 08:45

The focal point seems a little fucky with scaling
like, using the user scaling
you can always give your own in-quest 'mouse scale' option though, and just scale the bitmap you pass in.
Also, notable, the mouse is not scaled the same as tiles. It, uh, doesn't upscale with a larger window.

^Note this one being smaller relative to the explosion/link compared to the previous image. All I did was resize my ZC window to be larger.

And, as I noted in the documentation, the palette of the cursor does NOT update. When you set it, that's effectively a "draw", to an A5 bitmap using the current palette.
....and another notable thing, it requires a waitframe after the bitmap image is drawn before you set the cursor, as it is not a drawing command.

Finally got around to trying this feature and it looks cool. Seems the second time I try to update the cursor graphic it reverts to a windows cursor though, even if it's seconds apart...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 10:24

Oh?
Try changing the cursor back to blank before updating it, maybe?

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 10:30

Ah yup! That did it

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 10:33

```generic script CursorThing
{
    void run()
    {
        Game->MouseCursor = ZCM_NORMAL;
        while(true)
        {
            int X = Link->InputMouseX;
            int Y = Link->InputMouseY;
            if(InputLeftClick())
            {
                for(int i=Screen->NumNPCs(); i>0; --i)
                {
                    npc n = Screen->LoadNPC(i);
                    if(X>=n->X+n->HitXOffset &&
                    X<=n->X+n->HitXOffset+n->HitWidth-1 &&
                    Y>=n->Y+n->HitYOffset &&
                    Y<=n->Y+n->HitYOffset+n->HitHeight-1)
                    {
                        bitmap b = Game->CreateBitmap(16, 16);
                        b->Clear(0);
                        b->FastTile(0, 0, 0, n->Tile, n->CSet, 128);
                        Waitframe();
                        Game->MouseCursor = ZCM_NORMAL;
                        Game->SetCustomCursor(b, 1, 1, false, false);
                        Game->MouseCursor = ZCM_CUSTOM;
                        b->Free();
                    }
                }
                while(InputLeftClick())
                    Waitframe();
            }
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
Here's the dumb gimmick I did to test it. Any enemy you click with the mouse, mouse becomes that enemy's sprite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 10:34

haha
ok, so the custom cursor isn't refreshing properly on its' own

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 10:36

...PAHAHAHA I'm a dumbass
```cpp
if(index == active_mouse_sprite)
    set(index);
```
Makes sense, refresh the sprite if it's the active one, yeah?
....but
```cpp
if(index == active_mouse_sprite) return true;```

...should be fixed, you shouldn't need to change it back and forth anymore
