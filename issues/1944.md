I don't know if it's possible, but It would be cool to have a sizable sprite effect in Sprite Data.   Have the width and height settings and X and Y offset settings.

That wouldn't do anything though
Sprite data doesn't exist on it's own
It's mostly used with weapons
So, that would just be the size of the weapon
