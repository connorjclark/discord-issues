We should put in a directional buttons check boxes in the triggered tab for the warp combo types which is useful for making doorways for sideview gravity screens/map that you press UP to warp like in SMB3.

there's a reason it was 8 buttons (8 bits in a byte)
and how would that work with controller (joystick?)
that's weird shit
so IDK how that'd work

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and how would that work with…"): Presumably whenever the "up" key is detected as being pressed? (Walking up, left-up, right-up, etc.)

Frankly I have no idea how that even works now
there is code for specifically joystick input
but that just
isn't used almost anywhere?
controllers confuse the heck out of me
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "there's a reason it was 8 but…"): regardless, this is a thing
I'm trying not to bloat quest files too much
