Subscreens have functioning ID's accessible by `dmapdata->PassiveSubscreen` and `dmapdata->ActiveSubscreen`, but they are never displayed in the editor.

Also, aren't the IDs separated by passive and active? I may be misremembering, but I don't remember if the order on the list of subscreens in the editor matches the ID

It matches the order,  but active/passive are numbered separately, yeah

Manually typed the ID's here for my own use
