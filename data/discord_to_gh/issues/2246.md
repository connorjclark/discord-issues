Dear devs. Deathrider and I were wondering if it would be possible to switch the layer you are currently editing with the numeral keys (1 to 0).
I reckon nobody is using the palette switch (currently assigned to numeral keys) anyway, and to be honest I've always hated it for accidentally pressing a numeral key and changing palette.
But if we want to keep that functionality it could be setting perhaps?

Being able to set personal hotkeys in ZQuest was always on the wishlist for me, but this is a really game changing feature I think that would enable making screens much faster üôÇ

Kind regards,
Sven

...hmm.... it would require rewriting an absolute fuckton, and a bunch of new gui work, but.... I feel like it should be possible to make hotkeys configurable
at least for the main screen, not for dialogs
But, I just made cheat hotkeys configurable so I have some gui work for that I can steal....
basically instead of having separate keyboard procs that call all these hotkey functions
it would need to have a single special keyboard handler that checks against the configured keys
....though, the ability to configure modifiers is more difficult
nothing has that yet, cheat mods aren't really that at all
so it would need some new design there...
Definitely have me getting ideas, don't have the energy to tackle this yet though

pretty sure this hotkey already exists
can't test, but it's some combination of modifier keys with 1-6

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 21:28

Ah, yep! @ Rebonite `Ctrl+(0-6)`
my idea still stands so I'll leave this open

=== @ Twilight Knight 03/21/2023 18:28

Aw yea, awesome that it's already in there. @ Deathrider the hotkeys apparently already exist üòÇ 

Having configurable hotkeys would be very awesome, I guess the request description doesn't fit anymore though

Thanks for the help so far

Will check this out tonight

(meta) thread name was changed: [ZQuest] customisable hotkeys

@ Russ
> Could we bind the scrolling through to page up and down like in small mode?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2023 20:32

Note that PgUp/PgDn are taken by the combo panes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/25/2023 20:40

wait, do they do that in small mode?
Cause I remember PgUp and PgDn scrolling through the bottom in small mode, not doing combo pane stuff

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2023 21:02

*did* they do that, small mode is dead
and ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@ Russ `Shift+PgUp`/`Shift+PgDn` ok as defaults?

=== @ Russ 03/25/2023 21:10

Uh... maybe? Can't we make it configurable?
Deedee's correct
PgUp and PgDown scrolled through panes in the bottom in small mode

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2023 21:10

literally said `as defaults`

=== @ Russ 03/25/2023 21:10

Oh, missed that
Figured you mean instead

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2023 21:10

and this entire thread is about making *all zq hotkeys* customizable

=== @ Russ 03/25/2023 21:11

That works I suppose, though I worry two button hotkeys are far less intuitive than one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2023 21:26

@ Russ nightly in ~30min, hotkeys not configurable but that default is set and works
(another nightly will be posted as soon as hotkeys are finished, which is just a chunk of gui work really- did the last non-gui setup for it just now)
