A tooltip by the "Only Validate Cost" windows in the "Action" tab of the Item Editor explaining that this means that the relevant counter will be checked to see if it meets the minimum, as input by the user, and if so it will work WITHOUT draining the counter, and if it does not meet the minimum, it will not work.
