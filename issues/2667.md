Not sure if this has been fixed (using alpha 114), but, Link can pass through half tiles and enter water. Using a fully solid combo on Layer 1, or 2 also allows Link to pass through. Using a fully solid combo on layer 0 prevents it. Someone else mentioned that this also is the case for vertical half tiles (east/ west facing).

Also, seems walking south works as intended; you don't pass through the half solid combos.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 21:49

*specifically* when entering water, there is no clipping issue otherwise?

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 21:50

You can enter, and exit the water on 'north' borders. I can make a short video if needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 21:50

...and uh, should also probably ask
qrs related to water? movement?

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 21:53

Suppose I could work around it if I used a solid water tile, but it would look weird. You wouldn't be able to enter this water anyway, but there will be other cases where you will be able to swim around bridges

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 21:53

oh, you're using *classic* movement
so this is definitely not my collision stuff
thank god
(I would recommend enabling `Newer Player Movement` and seeing if that fixes it, @ DeletedUser )

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 21:54

I'll try that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 21:54

(because that has 100% rewritten from scratch collision/movement code)
(based on ghost.zh's)

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 21:55

also I can move in 8 directions, but I don't seem to have either new movement rule checked.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 21:55

(re: `Hero->MoveXY()` exists, and that qr makes the engine use THAT for the movement)
(replying to @ Anthus "also I can move in 8 directio…"): that's diagonal movement, separate rule
diagonal movement qr isn't new
new movement qrs are both new

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 21:55

it still happens with `newer player movement`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 21:55

(new hero movement was my first attempt at rewriting, which allows changing `Step`- but it was janky as FUCK still)

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 21:55

actually uh...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 21:55

(and NEWER then was a full cleanup)

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 21:56

now I'm swimming on the bridge. that didn't happen before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 21:56

Oh?

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 21:57

With `Newer Player Movement`

With no new movement rules checked:

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 21:59

and this is with `New Player Movement` which seems identical to not using any new movement QRs
wait...
I uploaded the wrong thing, my bad

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 22:00

lol, that recorded ZQ

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 22:00

lol yeah

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 22:02

let's try this again, this is no new movement checked

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 22:03

with `New Player Movement`

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 22:05

only visible difference I see between no, and new is Link stops when pushing up against a solid combo with new
also only seems to be the north direction, in all cases. haven't tested left and right tho, but I've been told it does it too
... wait I already said that lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/19/2023 22:07

(replying to @ Anthus ""): most of my changes are locked behind New Water Collision
check if it still does it with that enebaled; I don't *think* it would?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 22:10

oh lol, my brain just looked for the swim in solid water one and didn't even notice the new water code was off

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 22:15

Will check in a second

=== @ Anthus 09/19/2023 22:24

Cool, that seems to fix it
No new movement checked, `New Water Collision` checked: Seems to work as intended.
With `Newer Player Movement` and `New Water Collision` checked: Works as intended.
With `New Player Movement` and `New Water Collision` checked: Works as intended.
... I didn't notice that QR either tbh. But either way it seems the new water collision QR fixed it

=== @ Anthus 09/20/2023 02:40

... Uh oh. Uh... This is with the New Water Collision and Newer Player Movement

=== @ Anthus 09/20/2023 02:42

removing the newer movement seems to fix it along with keeping new water collision checked.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2023 02:45

sounds like a @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) issue

=== @ Anthus 09/20/2023 04:16

~~maybe I can design around this and be like, "nah, it's actually like ascend from TotK!"~~

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/20/2023 05:44

(replying to @ Anthus "~~maybe I can design around t…"): Check this?

Thanks, will try when I get home later tonight.

=== @ Anthus 09/21/2023 00:30

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Check this?"): That appears to fix it, so far so good.
