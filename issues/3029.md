Crashes when reading that sign
index is 1000 but array size is 512

oop. Should add a script error bounds check there, yep.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/01/2024 02:36

Occurs in 2.55 too (as indicated by sentry)
Did this always overflow (but before it did no bound check)?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2024 02:36

yeah this would've always been OOB
max levels has never been >512
so it was just a 512-sized array being accessed wrong

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/01/2024 02:44

Should this return 0 or -10000?
neighbororing registers do either...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/01/2024 02:47

sigh...there's so many things to fix throughout here.
