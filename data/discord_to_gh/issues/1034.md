I wrote a very simple function for RPG  quests, that can check the selected character and exchange the active subscreen, depending on it.

So I just thought it would be nice, if there was a Quest Script Option, that allows to instantly update the active subscreen Application (on every frame) if writing to "DMapData->ActiveSubscreen".
...without warping or scrolling to reinitiate the actual screen
