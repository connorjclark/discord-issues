I think it'd be cool if we had the option of picking and clicking where the PTM starts. Would make it easier for some people.

...could the player dialog be extended to show a preview of any given LTM entered?

(replying to @ Jared "I think it'd be cool if we ha…"): except, uh, this doesn't work with stacking multiple
also like, for which animation would it be selecting?
"starts" is not a thing
each animation starts at the tile set for it in the player sprites
so, there is no one "start" point to use
(replying to @ Jared "I think it'd be cool if we ha…"): so, this idea... seems dead on suggestion, because I don't even know how it would begin to work?
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "...could the player dialog be…"): This *could* work though
...player sprites is still an old gui....

That would be nice!

yeah that's why i suggested an enterable number
because it allows you to fool around with the results of stacking multiple PTMs
