Crystal Switch - Place LW_SPARKLE Randomly flag. When checked, Crystal Switches will place a random sparkle every 24 frames similarly to how they do in LTTP

eh i guess this can be done with a script

=== @ P-Tux7 08/18/2021 19:17

i was just gonna make a layer overlay

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 02:52

It would be kind of a neat option. Link's sword also generates sparkles with charging / spinning in LTTP, but I'm not sure I should make a feature request for that, just thought I'd mention it here.

i think the idea of Crystal Switches that affect a combo in a whole Dmap is kinda cool without the use of a bunch of Secret flags,  So like a combo is Crstal A and B and then Crystal block A, B C and D for diffrent colors raised and lowered

You could just have an animated combo for the sparkles
either have the switch combo itself have them, or have a switch block combo on a layer above the switch (switch block so it changes color of sparkle based on the switch state)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 21:54

the problem being, we don't know exactly what your switch combo will look like, so it wouldn't look the best without a number of ways to configure it... which then clutters up the combo options for one visual feature

=== @ DergerSwerson 08/20/2021 21:55

ive already solved it with a script, so you can mark this as "better off with a script" I guess. I was just thinking with future LTTP designers in mind

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 21:55

@ Mitsukara for the sword, that probably would be doable, just similarly to arrow sparkles, on a flag, using a weapon sprite from the sprite list. Make a separate thread for that?
(replying to @ DergerSwerson "ive already solved it with a‚Ä¶"): My point being you don't even need a script, just an animated combo

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 21:56

That depends on how far off to the sides of the switch the sparkles go, but yeah. Seems low priority in any case

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 21:56

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîíCrystal Switch Sparkles

=== @ Mitsukara 08/20/2021 21:56

I wasn't planning to make a request but I will since you asked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2021 21:57

worthwhile to have, especially given an 8-bit sword can't flash to show charging
so that would solve that problem
