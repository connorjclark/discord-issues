=== @ FireSeraphim 04/01/2023 22:37

Twice now I had to reset my computer because of ZC autosave feature causing the entire system to freeze (for now I'm disabling autosaves) and twice it's been because it tried to autosave right after getting out of the tile editor. This is some serious shit.

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/02/2023 01:55

just had the computer freeze on me without autosaving when I went to save after editing the tile page after running the program for 15 minutes or more. This is a critical bug thaty cannot be brushed aside

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 01:29

....Well I need more info than "autosaving crashed everything" because clearly you're the only person who's reported such an issue happening

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/03/2023 07:32

from the last time I ran ZC, which was very recent

don't know if this even helps

=== @ tim 04/03/2023 07:40

can you pull up task manager aside zc and see if its eating the ram

uhhh
that's an odd place for it to cut off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 07:44

out of curiosity, can you upload `includepaths.txt`? @ FireSeraphim

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/03/2023 07:49

sure

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/03/2023 07:51

includepaths.txt is absolutely blank on my end
wtf?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 07:57

hmm. that print at least makes sense then
it wasn't cut off, it was printing a *blank file*

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/03/2023 20:37

any progress on addressing this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 20:54

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have no idea where to begin

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/03/2023 21:15

Why don't you begin by digging into both the file saving code and the tile editor code?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 21:18

Yes, stare at two whole files looking for... Something to randomly show itself!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 21:22

that's like telling someone to dig for buried treasure, but instead of an X marks the spot, you just circle a couple whole countries on a map.
...not meaning to be rude, sorry. It's just that there isn't enough information here to go off of.
The includepath thing looked slightly suspicious, but I see nothing wrong with it in any sections of code

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/04/2023 23:25

Then as an experiement, how about disabling includepaths generation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/04/2023 23:32

what part of it
reading from file, writing to file, or which part of the gui?
....there's nothing at all suspicious with any of these systems looking them over, so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/04/2023 23:46

...and the fact that it's just freezing you instead of crashing means we probably don't get any form of crash report

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 00:00

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "Then as an experiement, how a‚Ä¶"): I just tried disabling some random include path stuff. I have no reason to believe this will fix anything, but let's see
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1091853953538478192/1092962039741284372/zquest.zip?ex=65e7b238&is=65d53d38&hm=ae79920ac150dba280fd0c9d80933bfd693041898e6989e73906f925039f3f0e&

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 00:14

so far I'm not having any noticable problems but I only been running the program for a few minutes, and I have edited tiles and saved twice already.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 00:42

... If that fixed it, then that points to.... the basic c++ file io code?
That can't be right

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 01:24

fired it back up again, went and edited more tiles. So far it's stable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 01:37

....well then try this.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1091853953538478192/1092986291118940201/zquest.zip?ex=65e7c8ce&is=65d553ce&hm=3642194bf49d7b6139e3fbfce9e4bfe2acd043a282d4a124f5dd859afb7043ed&
I un-did the "fix" (considering that literally just entirely broke include paths entirely)
and instead made it pop up a popup before it does shit
with some info
If it freezes again, that info might be helpful? It's just printing what the string should include though.....
(this entire bug makes no sense whatsoever)

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 01:55

just now got your editted program

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 02:12

it seems to be holding steady (still have autosave disabled)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 02:19

well, I completely undid the fix so
that uh
....definitely not helping
I would re-enable autosave?
(Did you have it disabled in the previous build I gave you to test?? If so, that's kind of a useless test...)

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 02:24

Not really useless since it was happening to me after I disabled autosaving as well
as I alluded to in my second post

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 02:25

oh, missed that

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 02:25

includepaths.txt is still blank though (in relation to the newest tests)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 02:25

Did you do anything to it?

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 02:25

no

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 02:25

If the file exists and is blank, it's not going to change it for you
it only changes it for you if the file does not exist already
(for all it knows, *you edited it to be blank*)
(it thinks having no include paths is your intent)

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 02:52

the pc just froze and I had to reboot it
I swear to god I did not touch includepaths.txt beforehand

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 02:53

did you turn autosave back on?
or did it happen without that?

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 02:56

I turned autosave back on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 02:56

Is `Uncompressed Auto Saves` checked or not?

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 02:57

it's checked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 02:57

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The only thing I can think here is that a windows update broke something, and its' your computer

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 03:06

The computer I'm using is running Windows 7

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 03:07

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
nothing changed recently with any autosave or include path or anything, so this suddenly happening now, I have no idea
not to mention the fact that it's freezing your whole computer.... ZC itself can't do that unless there's something wrong with windows as well
It might not be Windows itself, could be like, a graphics driver or something
but with no one else reporting this issue, no way to replicate it myself, no idea where to look (include paths seem like a complete dead end here, and didn't make much sense to begin with), and no crash reports
there.... is really not much I can do here

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 03:12

I see....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 03:14

Basically you're saying `When I run ZC, sometimes my entire computer gets nuked`, without any further useful details
which, I mean, not your *fault*- clearly you don't HAVE any more details to give
it's just.... if I poured all my time into fixing this, it could take weeks if ever
and that would be 24/7 working on this one thing
and I could spend weeks and make literally 0 progress
I literally would just be poking at random code in the engine, tweaking it, and I would need you to test every single tweak to let me know if it fixed anything
and, if I *did* fix it, then I'd need to figure out *why that fixed it* to actually know what's wrong
that's all assuming it's something I *CAN* fix, which if it's a driver issue, may be completely impossible
....I only have one more thing for you to try
swap graphics drivers

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 07:17

To which one?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:17

Whatever it isn't
(if it was "default" before, try both?)

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 07:18

Mine was set to default and I don't know what default mean. Does it mean DirectX or OpenGL

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:18

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Just try both and see if either of them doesn't crash

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 07:18

Then I can't help you further since I don't what default means
It's clear that there's two drivers and default could be referring to either one of them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:19

yeah, it's probably OS dependant or something
so, try OpenGL, and try DirectX
and see if EITHER works
if either of them doesn't crash.... you have a fix
if both crash.... I don't have a fix for you
and will need more information to help further

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 07:36

change of driver is showing some results.. don't know if it's related to the current glitch or if it's another one, this time around it simply crashed properly instead on the opengl driver
and this happened just now. I'm going to send you the allegro.log file

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1091853953538478192/1093076962303545374/allegro.log?ex=65e81d40&is=65d5a840&hm=7bb0b553ba811caf7a07e963ed775c14d713ff16adddedfd61ca0d7641f9bcec&

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:37

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "change of driver is showing s‚Ä¶"): a proper crash could help, hopefully it generates a crash report

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 07:38

isn't the allegro.log the crash report?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:38

no
allegro.log is the general log file
it logs stuff every time the program runs
including every single thing that would appear in the ZScript debug console (for ZC, or the Debug Console for ZQ)

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 07:39

so where can I find the crash report you need?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:39

A *CRASH REPORT* is a SUPER fancy thing that is sent to Sentry when you crash
you don't do anything, it gets sent automatically

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 07:39

I see.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:39

...though nothing's come in yet
err, wait
you were using one of the builds I sent
weren't you
those DON'T generate crash reports, only proper nightlies downloaded from github do

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 07:40

the latest test/debug build you sent me with the messaging functionality

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:40

nightly just went up, so, I would update to that, and try to make it crash again
should send a crash report, unless one of the other bugs I fixed just somehow magically fixed this too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:41

For the record, *Crash reports are FANCY*
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1091853953538478192/1093078014830575656/image.png?ex=65e81e3b&is=65d5a93b&hm=c70c7c2b226f3b2dcd27c047cec690ced63c5e8aec9eed58a23eff6d78e70096&)
giving exact line numbers where issues occur
(this one here was a crash Deathrider was getting, which would have taken hours if not days to debug without this crash report- with this report it took 5 minutes)

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 07:51

just now crashed on me, again I don't know if it's related to the bug I'm suffering from

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:52

on the new nightly, or no?

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 07:52

new nightly and it kinda quick closed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 07:52

fun, no crash report....

=== @ FireSeraphim 04/05/2023 08:14

freezed up on me again (opengl)

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/13/2023 08:10

The latest build seems to have fixed my freeze issues
I think we can tentatively mark this as resolved
