Go right and then left to activate the Ganon fight (Ok, this is actually probably a bug in and of itself, isn't it, that the start room [or continue point?] can't initiate a Ganon fight)
Kill Ganon, pick up Triforce, shutter opens, yadda yadda. Go right and then left again.
Notice that he respawns! However, the shutter opens on its own, and he drops no Triforce, only ashes. Go right and then left again.
No more Ganon!
Of note is that this room is NOT a boss room. So this would be of interest to people who don't want Ganon to be the Dungeon Boss.
