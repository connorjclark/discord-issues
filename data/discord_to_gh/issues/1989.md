hahahahaha nope
not any time soon
from me at least

Not until 2035!

Hijacking this
(meta) thread name was changed: Solid and Platform FFCs, Solid NPCs, Solid Objects

I'd be wary. You'd have to add options to *each* combo for what happens when it squishes Link - does it push him out, make him stay unmoved unless you move him, or squish him? That could bloat quest sizes, due to being set for each combo, unless you do some complicated thing where the squish result choices for each combo aren't saved in the quest unless there are solid FFCs in the quest at all.

Actually, I wonder if there's other saved combo data optimizations this concept of "saved only if the quest uses them" can be applied to? I'll look into this tomorrow or soon

=== @ P-Tux7 11/14/2022 07:24

This is a very big thing and official games often only get away with it because they hardcode their responses to each object that can squish Link and don't have to cater to each user's ideas for what should happen. Good luck, you'll need it.

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "I'd be wary. You'd have to ad‚Ä¶"): see, you're thinking of optimizations that are not as good as the ones I've already made
not elaborating at the moment because tired as fuck, just woke up, and need to get ready to go out

Check out fantastic implementation of solid objects by Moosh for 2.53x.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2022 08:23

so uh, solid ffcs, npcs, basically any sprite are mostly done
(see teasers that have been posted the past few days)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2022 08:25

next is either script access or making the ice rod functional

=== @ Alucard648 11/23/2022 10:02

Forgot crushing.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2022 10:05

right, crushing too

=== @ vlamart 11/23/2022 14:42

Ice rod, then you can dump script access to everything at once

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2022 05:35

IDK, implementing the script access now will allow people to monkey around with it and report bugs *while* you do the ice rod

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2022 05:36

If you save it all for the end then you'll have to handle implementing the script access *and* fixing the bugs with it all in a row with no break... that could lead to burnout

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2022 11:26

both valid points
