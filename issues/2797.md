This shows up when profiling classic_1st.zplay running uncapped FPS. Seems like a lot.

This can probably be marked dirty when:
- The player gains or loses an item (or dmap changes, because dmap item disabling)
- The player becomes or ceases being a bunny
- A script modifies the player's inventory (gains or loses an item by script)
- A script modifies an item's `->TileMod`
- The player gains (or runs out of) a `Clock`
- Any counter changes at all
- Player starts or stops using an "Active Shield"
