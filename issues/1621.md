i.e. swap an Aquamentus' fireballs to Boss or a Manhandla's fireballs to Blockable. Highly versatile and allows for buffing Walking Enemies, Wizzrobes, and Aquamentus, while nerfing the other Z1 bosses. Also great for statue shooters (which would go great with custom enemy-spawner combos)

Tomorrow I'll upload the 1 dungeon example quest I made for James24 that features Emily's EWeapon script she made for it. The balance is a little out of whack but if you cheat in a Gold Ring it shows the potential of this request to make enemies a lot more versatile, and that demo doesn't even get into most of the nerfing potential yet
