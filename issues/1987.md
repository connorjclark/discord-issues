I AM INSANE (#1986)
So, as of current, here's a test script I'm using:
```cpp
class foo
{
    int x, y;
    foo(){}
    foo(int tx, int ty)
    {
        //x = tx;
        //y = ty;
        printf("Created foo: '%d,%d'\n",tx,ty);
    }
    ~foo()
    {
        //printf("Destroyed foo: '%d,%d'\n",x,y);
    }
    void print()
    {
        //printf("Foo: %d,%d\n",x,y);
    }
    static void static_print()
    {
        Trace(5);
    }
}

global script Active
{
    void run()
    {
        foo f = new foo(10,5);
        //f->print();
        //foo.print(); //!TODOUSERCLASS should error!!
        foo.static_print();
    }
}```
This compiles, granting https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1035250122218549369/1035362588718010440/unknown.png
At this point, what should work:
-defining a class by name, which can be used as a type
-`const`s inside classes
-`static` functions inside classes
-calling constructors, though no object is actually created yet, just the function is called.
-defining constructors (up to many overloads), and a single destructor (0 params) per class.

What still does not work:
-`this` in any class functions
-class member variables (ex. the `int x,y` in the code above, do NOT work right)
-`delete` calls for destructor
-pointer calls to member vars or functions (ex. `f->print()`, `f->x` do not work yet)

woooooooooooooooo
remaining to go:
-Arrays (they don't work at all or have anything set up)
-`delete` to call destructors

got `delete` working

Passing an object to another script using `OwnObject(obj)` now also works
and destructors work fine still

...and now they print their IDs better

So making arrays in objects that are size `10000` works!
pahahhahahahahaha

Default constructor now works
if you have no constructor, it just declares a no-params-no-body default constructor
and on calling a constructor with no body (i.e. with `prototype == true`), it uses the constructor opcodes instead of a default return value
so, viola
Only saving these to the save file and reloading them left to go
which is a monster, and I need a break first
but I've fucking almost powered through this entire feature set
I just
fucking
wow
....oh, and then I need to document it all. That'll be fun.

and fucking
holy shit

That constructs an object on firstplay
then if you save the quest and re-launch it
it loads
the object
that was saved
(there's no save command or anything, it's part of the save file)
(but, you need to make the object `Global` by calling `GlobalObject(obj)` for it to be saved)
(any other objects will be destructed on exiting)
