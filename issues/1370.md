In 1.92 and 2.10 quests that have the quest rule "Rope 2s Don't Flash" enabled, the Rope 2s should use CSet 9 instead of 8. A few graphical problems with them due to this in Dreams of Yesterday, and in The Islands of Zelda, it's impossible to tell them apart from Rope 1s due to this. I think To the Top has the same issue?
