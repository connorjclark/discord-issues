.
(meta) thread name was changed: ESC in player no longer bring ups GAME dropdown when system menu is active

Alt+G should

Are you saying this change was intentional?
Someone complained last time this broke.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 17:33

A lot of stuff about this entire menu was buggy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 17:34

testing it in 2.50.2, Esc sometimes opens the game menu, sometimes closes the entire system menu, sometimes closes the game menu, or sometimes does nothing at all

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/26/2023 17:36

It's useful that it opens.
Let's add it explicitly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 17:37

If so, I'd prefer a config for that; I personally dislike it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/26/2023 17:37

I rely on the muscle memory too, as do others @ HeroOfFireZC I think noticed it instantly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 17:37

but yeah, I had to rewrite the entire system menu, so a lot of the code around this got cleaned up
