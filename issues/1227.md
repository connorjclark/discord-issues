I would like to have the option to faithfully emulate the behavior of the Mask of Eyes as flags for the Lens of Truth (In YS 1: The Mask of Eyes causes the world to be rendered in grey-scale and hides enemies on screen but still reveals hidden passages and hidden items). This would be ideal for an alternate early game tier version of the Lens of Truth.

A video demonstrating the Mask of Eyes, please keep in mind the guy in this video is fighting a boss with the Mask of Eyes on as a self imposed challenge: https://youtu.be/DSA_sDbVABI

That's that part down

I'm not sure of a good way to make everything grayscale without also making the subscreen grayscale

=== @ FireSeraphim 11/30/2021 02:56

That's a nice step in the right direction at least.

What happened to this one?

no pallette stuff by script has been done
you can do greyscale already, just, it *will* affect the subscreen
