This would mainly be used for Dungeon type maps. Besides depending on the Disable items in Dmaps, you could now disable items on any map screen you choose simply by entering the ID of the item in a Text box in screen data.

adding more things to screen data takes a TON of memory

Oh
ok

this is easy
step 1: make two dmaps that have the same level, but different banned items
step 2: have side warps between the two screens take you to the correct screen on dmaps 1 and 2
so it looks like link is just walking to the next screen, and he keeps all his map, compass, boss key, and level keys, but it's really a different map
with different banned items
and when he walks back, it goes back to the original map

and of course to save on "real" map space, all of those dmaps can use the same "real" map
so both dmaps use the same "real" map, just the warp sets the "dmap" as the one with banned items
i can make a demo quest tomorrow if needed
