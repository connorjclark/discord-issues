Reposting the files for convenience sake. 
```ZC is crashing when my NPC the script runs
It seems to be crashing when I pass a this pointer into a function from an npc script
i.e. line 34, Owl_Dive(this); seems to be crashing
I don't see any specific reason why this would be the case```
Seems to be crashing on both Alpha 107 and 109.
(meta) thread name was changed: ZC Crashing When Messing With NPC Pointers in NPC Script

so wait, is this fixed @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) ?

Unless it broke again in a newer build, should be fixed
