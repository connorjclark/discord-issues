gif of the bug

These combos are set up as Liquid combos that require Flipper level 2 (not in quest, meant to always drown)
The top halves are solid with the Solid Is Shallow flag set.
Transitioning between screens while halfway down the combo onto the same combo will cause Link to start swimming even though he should be on the shallow part, and not be able to swim in the water regardless.

Okay, that's probably me not accounting fully for higher level drowning

Should be fixed now
