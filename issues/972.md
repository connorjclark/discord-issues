I don't know if this is a feature already since I haven't kept up with development, but I got the idea so I figured I should post it:

A secret flag similar to flag 16-31, but instead of changing the combo to a defined secret combo, it instead takes the screens undercombo.

`Secret->Undercombo`, interesting idea. I added `Secret->Next` recently, so it could be implemented just as that is.

(meta) thread name was changed: Secret--Undercombo flag
