If you use the tile grabbing function to grab tiles from another quest, it sets the zInfo (or at least the Itemclass Names) to those of the quest grabbed from.

So what baffles me here
most of this type of thing uses `keepdata` bool
to determine if it needs to just skip data or actually keep it
....buuuut
zinfo is based on the quest header
.....which ALWAYS has keepdata to true?
Which confuses me, as how the fuck does that not also overwrite your header info when grabbing tiles?
...oh, wait, I see
fek
....that isn't getting to the actual global header, but a local copy
which copies to the main one conditionally, much later in the function

Not fixed.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/22/2022 18:05

(can confirm they are different exes, as a different bug was fixed)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 18:12

....oh, ffs, I see
blehg
this is a tangled mess
a complete tangled bullshit mess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 18:15

....and that should be a very clean solution to the tangled mess?
if it ever finishes building

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/22/2022 18:25

Okay, now it seems fixed.

Turns out, the `header` info is read when you grab
but it reads only into a temp thing, apparently, instead of the actual main header object
zinfo was lumped in with header, but, it read to the main thing, as no temp was passed
adding a separate skip flag... allows it to grab the header but NOT zinfo
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíGrabbing Tiles from Another Quest Copies Over it's ZInfo
