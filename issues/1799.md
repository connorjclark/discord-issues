Since copying and pasting has been added in the script editor (or whatever we call it),  would it be possible to add copying and pasting names of items and enemies when copypasting their data, like the Sprite Data list? Heckeroni pizza, maybe even mass combo edit?

Making general text combos handle that will.... not be as easy
The script editor already had copy+paste functionality
just, you could only paste things that you had copied from the script editor itself, and you could only paste things you copied from it to other parts of the script editor
so, I just made those calls use the system clipboard instead
other things have no handling for more than one character being entered at a time
or for highlighting multiple letters at once to copy
