Completely random when it does and does not happen.

it looks like the bush is dropping an item that's falling into the hole, and your falling sprites for not-link aren't set
sprite 0 is the wood sword sprite

huh, that does seem to be the case, however the sprite does seem to hang after completing one animation cycle before vanishing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/29/2023 04:27

I think the falling time is hardcoded; it'll wait on the last frame if it finishes the animation early
so just make the last frame blank
