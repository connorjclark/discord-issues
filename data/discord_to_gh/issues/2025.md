Would like to see a new non-walkable combo type or flag that the player can only get over if he jumps over it with the Roc's Feather or Hover Boots. Would be a nice addition to quests that are not side scrolling. I have some ideas for dungeon entrances and underground drop-ins that use this mechanic. Thanks.

This is very difficult because you can get completely stuck then
there's no way to stop you from jumping and landing inside the non-walkable combo
the closest you'll get to this is Pitfalls, which already exist
you can jump over them with rocs or hover over them with hovers, but they aren't "unwalkable"- you can walk into them and fall
