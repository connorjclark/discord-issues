What it says on the tin. Support soundfonts so we can not be subjected to the awful Windows midi soundfont.

You can do this through means of a third party program like VirtualMIDISynth.

You can, but it's not nearly as convenient. Also, from what I recall, that option isn't without issues, like alt-tab causing all instruments to suddenly become pianos.
Which in turn results in very, VERY unpleasant amounts of ear rape.

Probably not worthwhile to touch this before the rewrite
