Just doesn't seem to be loading when I press the test option.  HELP!

=== @ Moosh 04/09/2022 18:10

Have you launched ZC on its own in this build? If you close ZQuest and ZC and then open ZQuest again, does it work?

Thank you.  Will get on it after I'm done setting up this subscreen

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/09/2022 18:16

I'll be posting an update to the alpha soon-ish

=== @ NightmareJames 04/10/2022 00:14

Works now, had to flush out memory.

=== @ cbailey78 05/02/2022 17:58

ZC is crashing right after the quest starts. I'm using the latest nightly build anyway.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 17:58

Allegro.log?

=== @ cbailey78 05/02/2022 18:01

I'll look for it...

=== @ cbailey78 05/02/2022 18:03

Here you go.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 18:07

~~Err, you sure you're on the latest nightly? That indicates an almost month-old build....~~ @ cbailey78
Or is that the previous info? Not sure, as the log file has q lot in it....
Make sure the quest is saved in the new build
Then delete allegro.log
*then* launch test mode and send the new log
That'll clear it up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 18:11

...hmm, also simple question, when you try to launch test mode, do you already have ZC open?

=== @ cbailey78 05/02/2022 18:15

Nope. ZC is not open before testing my quest.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 18:16

Well, test mode can't launch an instance of ZC if one is already open

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 18:18

Did you remove a `zelda.nsf` file?

=== @ cbailey78 05/02/2022 18:19

Nope, It's there in the same directory as ZC.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 18:20

```
Trying to load C:\Users\Acer\Desktop\ZC\2.55\zelda.nsf
nsf file 'C:\Users\Acer\Desktop\ZC\2.55\zelda.nsf' not found.
Trying to load c:\Users\Acer\Desktop\ZC\zelda.nsf```
It appears to be in neither of those locations
Unless it is in the second one and it's just crashing immediately from something else....
But that's the last entry in the log

=== @ cbailey78 05/02/2022 18:39

I have zelda.nsf in both locations and it's still crashing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 18:40

Not sure then. Gonna need the quest file.
Does this only crash in test mode, though?

=== @ cbailey78 05/02/2022 18:41

It does it to all quests, so it's not the quest file.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 18:41

Oh???
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?
(Not at my pc to test)

=== @ cbailey78 05/02/2022 18:42

It both crashes in test mode and regular ZC.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 18:42

(replying to @ cbailey78 "It both crashes in test mode‚Ä¶"): ... then why is this in this thread?

=== @ cbailey78 05/02/2022 18:43

Oops, I forgot to start a new thread to report a bug, sorry about that.
I already created a thread anyways to #1588
