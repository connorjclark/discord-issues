Ideas/Notes for `class` in zscript
ZClass

```cpp
class foo
{
    int x;
    int arr[5];
    foo(){}
    ~foo(){}
    void print()
    {
        printf("%d,{%d,%d,%d,%d,%d}\n",x,
            arr[0],arr[1],arr[2],arr[3],arr[4]);
    }
}```
In the parser, a class holds its' variables/constructor/destructor/functions.
In the player, an object will be a single large array of data. Each variable will take up one index, in order.
    Next, each array will take up one index, containing a negative value. This value is its' array index,
    and the negative index can be accessed like any normal array (except for `OwnArray`/`ResizeArray`/`DestroyArray`).
    After this, each array takes up its' size in indexes (the negative array pointers will map to these sections).
Accessing a member of an object will be done with '->', which will note that the left is a ZClass and do separate behavior.
    This will read/write the appropriate index value of the class array using appropriate ZASM.
Function internals of class functions need special parsing, to search for member variables of the class (and parent classes?) with every local read.
    Calling class functions works the same as calling, say, script functions; it'll generate the ZASM in each script that calls it.
//CONSTRUCTION
Calling '`foo obj = new foo();`' will call the constructor for '`foo`'. This first will need to instantiate the class, using an array form to represent it.
    This would look something like "`INITZCLASS d2,{0.0001,0.0005}`". This reads "1 variable, followed by 1 arr of size 5".
    The first value is the number of variables, each subsequent value is the size of each array.
    Having only 1 value would indicate having no arrays. Having no variables would mean the first value is '0'.
    This would return the class constructed ID, which is an ID associated with that exact array of values.
        (If the first of that type, assign new ID; else return ID previously associated)
Next would be "`CONSTRUCTZCLASS d2`", taking that ID and constructing a new instance with all 0'd out variables.
    By default this is 'Owned' by the current script.
Finally, the user's constructor function, if one exists, would be called.

//DESTRUCTION
Calling '`delete obj;`' will call the destructor for '`foo`'. A script being about to exit that owns the class will also call the destructor? somehow?
    Firstly, the *user's* destructor is called, before the default behavior.
    Then, "`DESTROYZCLASS d2`". Destroys the object and renders refs to it invalid. Also renders any negative array pointers to it invalid.
//FUNCTIONS
Calling any user class function, including constructor/destructor, requires extra behavior.
The object pointer value must be pushed to the stack as an additional parameter?
    Perhaps use a similar system to `SWITCHKEY`, though will need to `PUSH` old val, `WRITE` new val, call func, then `POP` old val back...
    Also, a '`this`' variable available to access this register?

//SAVE FILE?
By default, all objects are owned by the script that created them, and will be destroyed on exiting a quest.
By calling '`GlobalObject(obj)`', you can grant an object *global ownership*, which means its' data (and its' class constructed ID) will be saved to the save file.
    The assumption is that the object is stored in a global variable of some variety to keep a pointer to it.
Calling '`OwnObject(obj)`' transfers its' ownership to be local to the calling script.

Left to do:
~~-Special array handling for array members~~
~~-`OwnObject()` to act as `->Own()` for objects~~
~~-`GlobalObject()` to act as an UN own for objects. Allow saving them to save file?~~
~~-Destructors (`delete foo;`), acts as `->Free()` for objects~~
~~-A way for destructors to run arbitrarily when the object is freed?~~

oh should probably actually mark this finished
