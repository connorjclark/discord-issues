Just like other places, we could add the variable names to this input fields.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Just like other places, we co‚Ä¶"): this is a memory concern due to the number of screens
same for ffcs
or, do you mean the default ones set from annotations in the script? (Is that not already done for screens?)

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 05:58

nani? Shouldn't it only need to be saved per script?
cuz yeah, annotations good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 05:59

(replying to @ Moosh "nani? Shouldn't it only need‚Ä¶"): annotation-based ones are saved per script, the typable fields are user input labels they can name themselves
so those are per SCREEN/ enemy/weapon/object etc

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 06:00

I didn't have any annotations, my assumption was that the name of the variables in `run` would be used here like I've seen elsewhere.
Isn't this just per-script, not per-screen?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 06:00

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I didn't have any annotations‚Ä¶"): that's via annotations default values, yeah
then yeah, that should be done for screen scripts, didn't realize it was missing there
....wait, is that an old dialog? That's probably why lol

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 06:01

Would it be valable to add these to old dialogs anyways? I'm not keen on rewriting the whole enemy editor but having annotation fields on the script tab and maybe attributes seems valuable.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 06:02

(replying to @ Moosh "Would it be valable to add th‚Ä¶"): the whole enemy editor NEEDS to be rewritten

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 06:02

I mean it does, I'm just not doing it üòõ
Think that sentiment's echoed by pretty much everybody right now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 06:03

easier to add an AI assistant to help navigate it
