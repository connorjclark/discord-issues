As for current ZC version, Clock item cannot stop time without rendering Link invincible at the same time, unlike Castlevania. Here is the link to ancient PureZC forum thread about my futile attempts to do proper time stopping item script.

while we're at it
can we make the clock attributes script-writable
link's invincibility and the time stopping (both with args for how much, 0 being "infinite until further notice")
so that if you want a "inventory clock" item you don't have to spawn a literal clock on top of link

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "while we're at it"): 1. Already possible in 2.55 a92
2. I like idea of separate durations.
3. As for Stopwatch, it could keep as is (spawning clocks on top of Link). And add function to check if time id stopped or running.
