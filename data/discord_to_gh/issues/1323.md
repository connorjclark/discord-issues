A suggestion for them to have attributes to refill a certain amount of Rupees, Bombs, Super Bombs, and Arrows you set when Link collects them. I actually already thought you could do that, which is why I included winged sprites for said items in Cambria a la Link's Awakening.

err
could you not
use the pickup tab?
if you don't need more than one of those counters filled at once, I would think the pickup tab would just work....

oh duh that applies to all items...
sorry
though that reminds me
BS Zelda Ancient Stone Tablets had a potion type (gold) that refilled life, magic, bombs, and arrows. So that could still be of use eventually. Though no rush of course

potions in empty bottles can do up to 3 counters
if you absolutely need more, it isn't that difficult of a script, frankly
