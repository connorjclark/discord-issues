not sure if this is a bug/unintended side effect of compact + large mode/etc. probably a bit convoluted but I figure it's worth raising.

When using ZQ snapshot, the resolution of a main user interface screenshot is of a larger resolution in the tile grabber than what (I assume) is intended. The supplied screenshots are from compact mode.

Screen snapshot works fine, as shown in the supplied screenshot.
Additionally, taking a ZQ snapshot *in* a tileset works fine. 

Also attached is a screenshot taken in small mode - the 31-10 build - just for reference regarding the tile grabber resolution.

These screens are from the 15-2 windows 64 bit build, but I was achieving the same results on the 22-2 mac build last night.

also here's a large mode screenshot in the grabber

i figure this is just because of upscaling etc. screen snapshot's probably the way to go and all but someone else was having issues with this last night so i thought i'd raise it at least

ZQ snapshot is not intended for tile grabber
the Screen Snapshot is intended for tile grabber

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2023 02:27

was my first thought as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:27

ZQ Snapshot is just a screenshot of zq directly

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2023 02:27

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:27

so it wouldn't match up, at all

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2023 02:27

which is why the resolution jumps around

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:28

compact's screen is 3x, large's is 2x

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2023 02:35

mmmm like I said, wasn't sure if it was a bug or intended feature lmao. Glad to have that cleared up though! üòÖ
