I think it would be a good idea to have a preview tile in the slope combo editor wizard.  I don't know if it's possible to put in, but it would help to see the slope while you're putting in the values in the 4 fields.

The slope can be bigger than the combo window, so that's kinda hard.
If you place the slope on the screen and show solidity, though, it draws the line on the screen for the slope in pink.
