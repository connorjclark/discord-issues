AKA after you've pushed them on all the triggers. Didn't categorize this one as while it may be technically more useful as a screen flag, that might be a waste and it could also be a QR
So basically you can keep pushing blocks over triggers until you've got all triggers covered.
Though if pushing a pushblock onto it "erases" the trigger like I heard it does... uh oh
Sorry this is just another friend request

It would erase the trigger if the block is on the same layer
Because, the block... is a combo
And the trigger... is a combo
So you can't have 2 combos on the same layer in the same position

Layered, at least?
