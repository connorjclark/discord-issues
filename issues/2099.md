(Just putting this down as a thread while I edit notes into it.  Give me a moment.)
The name of the script on the screen this happen is:  
**MiniGameShooter**  (24)

The black screen it scrolls down to:

Pressing [F4] again at that paused screen rapidly scrolls it _again_, even while it's supposedly frozen.  I managed to catch it mid-scroll with PrntScrn.

Again, this isn't a behavior that you tap or hold F4 to watch it scroll.  It scrolls _on its own_ while it's supposedly Paused.
----------
So far, the undesirable behavior is present in:
**A111/112 December 17th 2022**
**A111/112 December 11th 2022**
**A111/112 December 7th 2022**
**A111/112 November 29th 2022** (The earlier one)
---
The undesirable behavior is **not** present in:
**Base A111**
**A111/112 November 27th 2022**
**A111/112 November 28th 2022**

So it happened between November 28th and November 29th.
This is the script on the screen where F4 breaks.

I think that's about all the information I am aware of to offer.  Godspeed, all!

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2022 04:02

Are you aware which screen that this happens on so the bug can be reproduced in Test Mode?
Or, if it's a minigame house, the screen outside of the house

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/19/2022 08:59

There's nothing special outside of these houses, but by all means, take a look.  "SimpleNPC" seems to be the only script running.

Easiest is in the first town we go to.  Just a tad north/northwest.  Slingshot house.   Level 4 Cheat code is "4" -  Use "G" to go to Dmap 3 (Calatia SE) and screen 2B.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2022 05:59

Still a problem since https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2022-12-19-2 ?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/14/2023 05:42

Is this still a problem in latest nightly?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 02/14/2023 09:03

It seems to be good in the 2-14-23 Nightly!  Thanks!

One question though:  Is there a way to _hold F4 down_ and have it slowly increase the game by one frame while the button is held?  Somehow that ability is no longer active and functional.  Holding F4 does nothing anymore.  It just remains paused.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/14/2023 13:23

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "It seems to be good in the 2-‚Ä¶"): seems correct, F4 is advance frame, it advances a single frame

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 02/14/2023 13:40

So there's definitely no way to be able to hold it down to advance it by a single frame, but over and over again, for a slo-mo effect?  Anyone can _press_ F4 without a problem, over and over again, though now there's no slow-mo effect at present.  It'd be nice to see it restored, but I'd understand if that were somehow impossible.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/14/2023 13:41

If that ever was a thing, it was likely a bug
I wouldn't expect that as intentional behavior

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 02/14/2023 13:42

My speech impediment made me pass my drivers test with a 100% because the old man proctor was too busy telling me all about life stories to pay attention to the road and how I ended the test on a 45 degree angle to the curb.   Unlikely behaviors can be amazing sometimes. üòõ  I'd think about it.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/14/2023 15:09

It did use to be tied to key repeat rate, which was lost. I'll check what happened.
