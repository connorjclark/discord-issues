Little quirk of onDeath scripts that I assume is because they run over the regular game over sequence: you can't use F4 to frame advance through them. While it's not super critical, F4 is a very helpful debugging tool when making complex animations and can catch issues that only show up for a split second. It would be nice if there were either a quest rule or even just a change to frame advance being limited during game over and credits overall. I don't think anyone's gaining an unfair advantage by TASing the death animation.

Sooo disabling F6 and disabling F4 are tied to the same thing
one moment

Seems to be pausing properly though the script ran after the vanilla game over. Is this normal?
Rule related somehow I assume

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 04:41

rule chooses when the script runs
zscript settings somewhere

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:42

That's really nice actually

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:46

Okay question now, how do I end the ondeath script?
Assumed set Link's HP and quit out to resume normal gameplay, but that just causes him to die again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 04:47

You cannot revive him
onDeath runs after he is already dead and gone
the only way to avoid 'engine death' running is to `Game->Continue()` or `Game->SaveAndQuit()`, etc

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:49

Ah, so if I want to do a quick wipe transition this isn't the way to go about that.

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:50

Is there a hack I could use to still get the handy screen freeze effect but run the script sooner? Like calling a subscreen script?

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:52

Or I suppose I could do a big wacky suspend setup the old fashioned way. I'm just spoiled by the convenience of how the subscreen script freezes everything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 04:57

You could use a subscreen script, by setting the current dmap's active subscreen script and then pressing start... but that's a little janky

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:58

Yeah if it weren't for the then pressing start thing that'd be ideal.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 04:58

feature request "generic scripts", I'm gonna need to make a new script type

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 04:59

Why's it need a new type?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 04:59

a slot that does nothing unless you launch it from another script
and you can either set them to run passively, or to run freezing everything
but they won't have a `this->` as they won't have an object
things that freeze things now are all built into specific types that work specific ways

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:00

Gotcha sounds exciting. So it could work kinda sorta asynchronously?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:00

yeah, kinda
think passive item scripts
but without needing to be tied to an item
and, with the *option* to make it freeze everything until script is done

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:03

Also, how do you like the idea of `break 2;`
