when smart screen scrolling and fixed smart scrolling are enabled;
if there are solid combos at one edge of the screen, it blocks link from scrolling that way where the solid combos would be like if they were on the next screen in the same position.

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒Smart Screen Scrolling Bug
Fixed I think
I think this is the same issue as FireSeraphim's bug and I just fixed that one
(and I didn't notice this behavior once I fixed that)
