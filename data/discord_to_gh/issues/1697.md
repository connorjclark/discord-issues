The shift and alt clicks on the effect and solid boxes don't do their respective shortcuts

Okay, just tested. Not working

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/26/2022 20:36

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) `src/gui/cornerselect.cpp`,
`int32_t newg_cornersel_proc(int32_t msg,DIALOG *d,int32_t)` ```cpp
bool shift = (key_shifts & KB_SHIFT_FLAG);
bool ctrl = (key_shifts & KB_CTRL_FLAG);```This is not reading these flags properly, it seems?

Similar bug as with alt, fixed.
thanks @ vlamart

I think you'd need to distribute the allegro-5.2 dll
uhhh
nvm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2022 01:13

that's the only thing that changed according to msvc

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/27/2022 01:13

yeah that should be right.
nvm!
allegro legacy = basically a4, but with some tweaks on top. so dll still calls itself alleg44
I had made changes to its `a5` folder hence I thought it'd be in the a5 dll but.. nah
