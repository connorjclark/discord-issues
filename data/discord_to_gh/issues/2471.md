When falling into lava on a sideview screen, the respawn point chosen is not the last place the player safely stood but is instead the last non-solid (none) combo the player occupied, regardless of if they were in a grounded state or not. This can lead to the player getting stuck in an infinite loop of falling into lava over and over until death.

I am also using sideview with water/lava and am not experiencing this

(replying to @ Deathrider "I am also using sideview with…"): Do you have classic respawn points as a quest rule?

(replying to @ Phosphor "When falling into lava on a s…"): This is not really possible to handle automatically, and is on you to manually place the `Unsafe Ground` flag to indicate what areas are not safe
...err,
hmm\
though it probably shouldn't spawn you in the AIR....
bleh
fuck
(No one uses sideview to report these things, apparently, lol)

=== @ Deathrider 06/22/2023 23:42

for me it puts me back where I entered the room
(replying to @ Phosphor "Do you have classic respawn p…"): I do
although it may seem you may not want that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/22/2023 23:43

Yeah, that'd do that
This report is specifically for that rule being off

=== @ Deathrider 06/22/2023 23:44

yea I realize that
sorry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/22/2023 23:44

(no need to apologize lol)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:56

(replying to @ Phosphor "When falling into lava on a s…"): fixed
