Version: 2.55 (Alpha 120)
As it says in the title,  the ``Dive->Item`` combo flag only gives you the item if you start your dive on the combo, which is different to its old behaviour where you can trigger it if you move onto the combo while you're diving.

Is this related to the newer player movement flags? When was the behavior correct?

Didn't we realize that the old behavior wasn't what you thought or something like that @ Orithan ? IDR
