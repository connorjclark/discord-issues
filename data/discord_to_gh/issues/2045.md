hmm

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/23/2022 14:35

Omg I love this idea 0_0  but I would also like slopes for top down also.* just like stellar seas has.

=== @ Moosh 11/23/2022 15:43

This gives me an incredibly cursed idea: Solid slope combo that interpolates a solid slope based on the 4 bit solidity mask. So for example...
```
01
11```
would be a right facing 45 degree slope but
```
01
01```
Would be a very steep slope
```
00
11``` 
Would be a shallower slope
```
00
01```
Would be a tiny right facing slope.
But then if you add in the effect square
```
10  01
10  01```
That's a right facing steep slope with full solid on the right.

Y'know, because a dropdown of slope presets would be too simple a solution 😛

=== @ Moosh 11/23/2022 15:49

occurs to my tired brain only the 45 degree one actually works. The rest can't interpret direction from just 4 bits. But it was a silly idea anyways and a dropdown is way better

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 15:50

yeah, like, giving an exact x1/y1/x2/y2 would be way too much... (/s)

=== @ Moosh 11/23/2022 15:51

...oh heck

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2022 15:51

@ Moosh it sure would be a shame if I already made things work even fancier than that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 15:51

such a shame

=== @ Moosh 11/23/2022 15:51

OH HECK
Can I request the preset dropdown anyways just to make editing a little faster?
Since like 90% of slopes people will want to make will be 45°

=== @ Moosh 11/23/2022 16:01

Thinking some more, if X Offset 2 can be > 15, how does this work for isSolid()? Does it get clipped by the bounds of the combo? Is 0,15 31,0 functionally the same as 0,15 15,8?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 16:03

@ Moosh join vc

=== @ Moosh 11/23/2022 16:03

can't right now, sorry

=== @ Moosh 11/23/2022 16:04

I'll be excited to take a look at this later tho 🙂

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 16:08

(replying to @ Moosh "Thinking some more, if X Offs…"): it does not give a shit about the bounds of the combo, for the record

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2022 16:13

(replying to @ Moosh "OH HECK"): moments like these make it worth it

=== @ Moosh 11/23/2022 16:14

That moment of it setting in that you are a mad lass

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 16:27

Also they work on ffcs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 16:29

And, while the walkability draw shows a thick line, it really is "mathematically-thin" since it actually uses linear math between the two points
just drew it thick enough for it to show up well
For combos whose line goes out of the combo bounds, the walkability lines in the combo selection columns will be bounded to the combo; but on-screen they show what they can

=== @ Alucard648 11/23/2022 18:36

Does non-solid slopes work like stairs in NES Castlevania games, that can only be accessed by standing on solid combos and pressing Up/Down?

=== @ Moosh 11/23/2022 18:39

Pressing down at the top of a jump-through platform connected to a slope appears to just work by the look of things. Dunno about bottom staircases, though I can imagine a script or even a trigger combo could very easily toggle one on and off based on context

=== @ Alucard648 11/23/2022 21:33

Wiil it be possible to have solid-on-top slopes (golden stairs in GSD demo quest)?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2022 21:41

you can put sideview platform flags on the top!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 21:43

Whether you can drop through sideview platforms or not is a QR, so it can't be changed per-platform, though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 21:44

though a script could change that QR per room if necessary
...adding a better form of ladder/platform would be smart. Something that isn't *FLAGS*.
(I didn't know how to add combo types back then...)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 21:49

You know, a "one way" combo of some sort would be nice....
Also @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) should slopes only work on layers 1&2?
I feel like they'd benefit from having all 6 layers to choose from
(plus 0 obviously)
gonna go grab food now

=== @ Alucard648 11/23/2022 22:35

Is slip speed configurable? It`s illogical to slipdown staircases (set slip speed to 0), although irresitible slipping fits very well in icy/snowy terrains.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2022 22:35

slip is configurable
0 means you don't slip

=== @ vlamart 11/23/2022 23:03

Do lit bombs or items slide down slopes too?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 23:03

....thank you for that

=== @ vlamart 11/23/2022 23:05

I was just thinking about something silly like of you could pick up and throw/drop objects, bowling with slopes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2022 23:06

well right now the items would fall through the slopes as though they weren't solid
as do enemies, though enemies were blatantly on our list

=== @ mitchfork 11/24/2022 00:18

I would think most weapons should treat them like solids
Oh catching up on the thread, already worked out

DOPE

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2022 19:31

@ Alucard648 anything else you wanted to see from this feature?

=== @ Alucard648 11/24/2022 19:35

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ""): Cross-screen slopes. Maybe item that prevents slipping on slopes. Enemy interaction. Hoping not too much.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2022 19:35

cross screen slopes might be easy, might not
item that prevents slipping, hmmm

=== @ Moosh 11/24/2022 19:36

Isn't there already one in the video

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2022 19:36

there is, but it just snaps you upwards
I don't know how feasible it is to have it push you upwards *while* scrolling
that'd be super fancy, but also could be hard

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2022 21:23

moving sloped platforms

this is really close to having moving/freeform sideview platforms
(those things you can jump through from below but not above)
the big thing is allowing you to fall through them

=== @ Alucard648 11/25/2022 13:02

Will crossing staircases work?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2022 13:02

ooh, I would expect not

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 15:19

and yet

DEEDEE YOU FUCKING WITCH
BLACK MAGIC

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 15:21

it stores the slope of whatever stairs you're standing on and compares it with other stairs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2022 15:21

*my god she's a mad lass*

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 15:22

it'll probably break under more intense usage! I don't trust whatever the fuck I did

=== @ vlamart 11/25/2022 15:28

Spinning platforms?

=== @ vlamart 11/25/2022 15:31

And do the new angled solidity translate to top-down? (The only application I'm actively thinking about right now are the magic mirrors with the thin graphic, just making a solid thin 45⁰ line)

=== @ vlamart 11/25/2022 15:34

And say if an angular projectile hits a non-45 or 90⁰ slope, will its direct change at the expected angle or will it round itself?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2022 15:35

the like, sideview stairs up-walking, is sideview only
but the angular collision is top-down too
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) test this:```cpp
combodata script spin
{
    void run(int speed, int len)
    {
        unless(speed) speed = 0.01;
        unless(len) len = 16;
        int angle = 0;
        while(true)
        {
            angle = WrapAngle(angle+speed);
            int dx = VectorX(len,angle);
            int dy = VectorY(len,angle);
            this->Attrishorts[0] = 8+dx;
            this->Attrishorts[1] = 8+dy;
            this->Attrishorts[2] = 8-dx;
            this->Attrishorts[3] = 8-dy;
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
(on a slope combo)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 15:51

(replying to @ vlamart "And do the new angled solidit…"): they translate to up and down, left and right

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 16:01

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) there seems to be an issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2022 16:02

uh oh what

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 16:02

the length is really tiny no matter what I set
and it's only doing it in 1 direction

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2022 16:02

???

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 16:03

I can vc if needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2022 16:03

because
I fucked
up
the script

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 16:03

ohh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2022 16:04

try now
`VectorX(angle,len) != VectorX(len,angle)`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 16:04

oh, duh
I can't believe I didn't catch that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2022 16:05

will hop in vc shortly, gonna grab food first

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 16:06

alright, I won't be here for long, have an appointment in 2 hours

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2022 16:09

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2022 20:38

I'm not sure how I want to handle script access to slopes

=== @ P-Tux7 12/02/2022 21:38

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "You know, a "one way" combo o…"): i thought that's how sideview platforms worked? is that only for sideview?
though, true that it would need to have the other three directions added
also, as for slopes, do they work in top-down a la lttp?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/03/2022 05:31

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i thought that's how sideview…"): those are sideview only and gridlocked
and only one way from above

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/03/2022 07:10

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "also, as for slopes, do they…"): yes, they do!
And Slopes can act as one way combos now

=== @ P-Tux7 12/03/2022 19:19

oh cool, so you just set it to be a "flat" slope?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/03/2022 19:31

ye
