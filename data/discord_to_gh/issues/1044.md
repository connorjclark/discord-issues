(Using ZC 2.55 Alpha 96)

For some reason this isn't a thing even though the documentation says it supports it (ZScript_Additions: line 808-834, I don't know if I'm misreading it or if I'm going crazy).

This is what I have been trying to do but the compiler spits out an error at me: 
int ArraySize = ArrayWidth * ArrayHeight;
int TempRoomArray[ArraySize];

(meta) thread name was changed: Allowing variables, or constants to be used in defining size for an array?

Is this being done inside a function, or globally?

Inside a function

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 04:32

should work for constants or variables

Final Adventure Quest\Final Adventure Scripts\DMap Scripts\Z3ScrollingEngine.zs Line 90 @ Columns 31-40 - Error T046: An expression is not constant that needs to be.

This is what im getting from allegro.log

oh, yeah, variables wouldn't work
oof
constants will work, though, if you make it `const int`
oh
the documentation specifically says `constant expression`
> Arrays now support being declared with any constant expression.
variables are not constant
so

=== @ OmegaX 09/25/2021 04:41

But the code examples shown below seem to suggest otherwise??? (I think I may be misinterpreting it...)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 04:42

`10*4` are both number literals
`10*4` is constant, it is always `40`
>     [example--

That's a `const int`
a constant, not a variable

=== @ OmegaX 09/25/2021 04:43

so this would never work: const int ArraySize = ArrayWidth * ArrayHeight;

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 04:44

if `ArrayWidth` and `ArrayHeight` are constants, it would
```cpp
const int WIDTH = 5;
const int HEIGHT = 10;
const int SIZE = WIDTH*HEIGHT;
int arr[SIZE];```
that works fine

=== @ OmegaX 09/25/2021 04:45

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "if `ArrayWidth` and `ArrayHei‚Ä¶"): those two variables are not constant in my script...
RoomWidth = TempRoomX2 - TempRoomX1;
RoomHeight = TempRoomY2 - TempRoomY1;
const int ArrayWidth = RoomWidth / SCREEN_W;
const int ArrayHeight = RoomHeight / SCREEN_H;
const int ArraySize = ArrayWidth * ArrayHeight;
int TempRoomArray[ArraySize];

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 04:46

then yep, that won't work there
the value needs to be constant at compile time
for the compiler to size the array

=== @ OmegaX 09/25/2021 04:48

damn...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 04:49

I will tell you, making an array really big doesn't hurt that much at all
so you can just make them really big

=== @ OmegaX 09/25/2021 04:56

Can I create an array, fill it up to a certain point (for ex: array size being 30 and the point we fill it up too is up to entry 10, with the other 20 being empty or 0) and then copy that array onto empty variable with only those filled in values (essentially another array with a size of 10)?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 05:02

. . . how would you size that other array any differently?
Anyway, when you create an array, everything in it is 0 by default

=== @ OmegaX 09/25/2021 05:03

Well I‚Äôm out of ideas...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 05:04

....just make it bigger than you need it to be?
What is the biggest it could ever need to be?
Or if you need all the space, just make it sized `MAX_INT`

=== @ OmegaX 09/25/2021 05:15

May I ask why ZC can't use variables to define array size? (being able to do something like would be really useful)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 05:28

because it uses the size during compile
it might be able to be changed, but it wouldn't work well with global arrays, which would be problematic and/or require additional error checking, which is a bunch of work to do.
