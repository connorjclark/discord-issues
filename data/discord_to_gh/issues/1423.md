Hey, since its deprecated but its still there, why not repurpose it?

or maybe instead a dropdown in the test menu that says "Arrival, Warp A, Warp B, Warp C, and Warp D. Depending on what you select thats where you start when testing.

So I mean
you'd need to reset it every time you opened the test window, as it wouldn't be able to auto-populate it smartly
so I'm not really sure how useful this would be
