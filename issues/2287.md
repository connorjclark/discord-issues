Trying to assign an enumerated constant to another later on in the function scope results in the compile error ``is not a constant that needs to be``.
This can be seen when the compiler trips up on ``BREAK_SELECT_START = MAIN_WSEC0,``, where it parses the whole line as a variable declaration.

Wow. I'm stupid.
Fixed.
(It was checking if the initializer was constant, before it "visited" the initializer- so it was checking `Hmm, is 'MAIN_WSEC0' constant?` BEFORE it figured out what variable `MAIN_WSEC0` even points to, so it couldn't possibly know if it was constant or not.
bleh
