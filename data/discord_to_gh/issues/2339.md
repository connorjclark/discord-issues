If the combo is triggered, run a generic script of the specified ID. This will allow scripts a way to interface with built-in combo triggers, eliminating the need to rescript say signposts just so you can do scripted things when you interact with them.

Good idea imo

=== @ Orithan 04/21/2023 03:05

That said the limitations of generic scripts (only 1 of each type running at a time) should be noted so people don't get confused when the generic script doesn't run multiple times when say multiple bushes get cut

Aren't combo scripts a thing?

=== @ mitchfork 04/21/2023 18:20

They are, but you have to code the triggering conditions manually then
Or do something like trigger -> advance to combo script combo -> revert to untriggered

=== @ P-Tux7 04/21/2023 21:50

should "run combo script when triggered" be a thing, then?
that sounds like it's the issue here and would allow multiple to run at once

no, no, no god no
if anything is added for generics, it would be the same as I added for the sccs, a run frozen generic option
but I'm not fucking with combo scripts

=== @ P-Tux7 04/21/2023 22:32

...is something wrong with those

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 22:36

no, it's just, they aren't designed to work that way

=== @ vlamart 04/22/2023 02:14

Something similar to a `->HitBy[]` system would at least be neat so you can do like
`if(combo->TriggeredBy[boomerang] == true) cmb+1;
if (combo->TriggeredBy[arrow] == true) cmb+2;`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 08:03

(replying to @ vlamart "Something similar to a `->Hit…"): this would be VERY difficult... knowing what is triggering it is not a thing in the generic combo trigger code, really. Would need to add a way to handle that...
and this would be a *separate feature request*.

Looks good
