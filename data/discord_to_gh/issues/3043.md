Builtin objects (stack, paldata, rng, etc.) are created differently from instances of a custom class, and have some overhead in terms of managing lifecycle. Namely, they all must be "loaded" and then "owned", and usually not calling "->Own" is a programmer mistake that results in an object leak.

Here's a quick and dirty attempt at something better ...

# 1. Add constructors to built in data types

Custom user objects have constructors, and calling `new` automatically assigns ownership to the current script.

We can do the same for builtin objects.

```c
stack mystack = new stack();
```

This calls a symbol `Stack->Ctor()` (or whatever) that allocates a stack. This could be overloaded.

If the call to `new` is in a function scope, it also assigns ownership to the current script. Otherwise, if in global scope there is no owner by default.

So this would be an ownerless, global stack:

```c
ffc script MyStack
{
    stack sharedStack = new stack();

    void run()
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Note, this would still assign the owner to the script:

```c
ffc script MyStack
{
    stack sharedStack; // unallocated, like it is today

    void run()
    {
        sharedStack = new stack(); // script owns this
    }
}
```

# 2. Add a global function `RemoveOwner(T object)`

For the use case where one wants to have an object that lives beyond the script that calls `new` in a function scope,
introduce a way to remove the ownership of any object.

```c
ffc script MyStack
{
    stack sharedStack; // unallocated, like it is today

    void run()
    {
        sharedStack = new stack(); // script owns this
        RemoveOwner(sharedStack); // now noone owns it
    }
}
```

Might as well also have `AssignOwner(T object)`

# 3. Add dtors

Same as calling `->Free`.

----

Benefits:

1. Allow us to deprecate `Game->LoadStack`, `Game->LoadRNG`, etc.
2. Make the common case the default behavior (getting an object = object is destroyed when script ends)
3. Match syntax for creating builtin objects with creating custom class objects

> If the variable is in a function scope, new also assigns ownership to the current script. **Otherwise, if in global scope there is no owner by default.**

Is this exception useful, or confusing behavior?

Useful, I'd say
though, uh, not sure how easily you'd do that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 05:53

It'd be a journey in the lexer/parser for sure.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2024 05:53

global variable initializers are run inside the `global script ~Init`, so, you'd need a way to make that not own them
but you wouldn't want that to apply to a user object that is created locally in any user init script which is appended to `~Init`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 05:55

Oh let me make this less confusing:

> If call to `new` is in a function scope, it also assigns ownership to the current script. Otherwise, if in global scope there is no owner by default.
_thats_ what I'm thinking
Don't care what scope the variable is _declared_.
My examples make it more clear.

(meta) thread name was changed: Make builtin objects match class objects re: creation/ownership

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 05:59

That's just what I thought intially, but if its better to be based on where the declaration is instead of the scope of `new` I'm all ears.
