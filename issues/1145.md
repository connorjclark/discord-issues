Time to fix this. This breaks a remake of Outlands because it has Tektites that enter from sides. In Z1 they don't do anything special. They just spawn at the sides.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 09:15

So uh
what exactly is the bugged behavior?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 10:44

I don't think this "ever" worked
But I'll test quest it tonight formally

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/07/2021 14:14

This never worked.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/07/2021 14:15

It requires a heavy handed rewrite of that enemy class to make it work. You can fake it by spawning. WALKER from the sides and using a script to change them to a textile class...

=== @ NightmareJames 11/13/2021 19:42

Test quest incoming

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 19:47

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "It requires a heavy handed re‚Ä¶"): if tektites being spawned facing left or right on enter from sides, when ordinarily they're being spawned facing up by default is the issue, why not just make an exception in either the tektite class or the enter from sides routine that says "tektites ALWAYS spawn facing up"

=== @ NightmareJames 11/13/2021 19:49

Tektites from Sides.  Have Fun

@ P-Tux7 so what should they be doing?
Should they just appear at the screen sides?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 17:00

yup

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 17:28

wait what the fuck
they are not behaving right *at all*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 17:29

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "if tektites being spawned fac‚Ä¶"): ^

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 17:45

Really easy fix I think

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 17:47

Forcing their dir to be down every frame fixes it.
(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìTektites Entering From Sides

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 17:54

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Forcing their dir to be down‚Ä¶"): uh just for the spawning or...?
because some graphics have the tektites as 8-way

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 17:55

It should just spawn initially facing down

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 17:55

if you've ever played DOR or PTUX quests which have the tektites and frogs which you can see the behind of when they face up
oh good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 17:55

no, I mean, I'm saying that
not deedee
so I don't know what she's done

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 18:44

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "because some graphics have th‚Ä¶"): Yeah but those don't use the real direction

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 18:51

oh mm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 18:58

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "It should just spawn initiall‚Ä¶"): hmm... I could do that too, but I'm unsure why anyone would willingly call this bugged behavior and safety proofing it feels smarter

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 11:35

I just made the tektites ignore the direction being set by side loading, which should be a more elegant solution (while still preserving the bugged behavior in case anyone *actually* used it intentionally)
```It requires a heavy handed rewrite of that enemy class to make it work. You can fake it by spawning. WALKER from the sides and using a script to change them to a textile class...``` "lol" said the deedee. "lmao"

=== @ P-Tux7 02/14/2022 20:49

Wait is this in the latest build

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 21:08

not yet
next build to get posted will have it
