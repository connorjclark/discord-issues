@ P-Tux7 @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) (adding to thread)
so
DMap flag: `Bunny without pearl`
Item class: `Pearl`
no flags, attribs, etc on it; just having one is sufficient
Item Flag: `Can use as bunny` for all items
`Link->BunnyClk` as a zscript/internal var. Negative on bunny dmaps, if positive acts as a timer (like the little yellow things that turn you bunny)
perhaps `-1` specifically on bunny dmaps, and writing a different negative value by script would turn you and not be undone by pearl
and, init data: `Bunny LTM`
while a bunny, the LTM applies
also, items that cannot be used as a bunny will *not* have their LTMs apply while in bunny form
i.e. for disabled shields
does that all sound reasonable?

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:29

Sounds excessive IMO
In ALttP, bunny Link couldn't do anything could he? It was a glorified sword jinx
So using an item flag on something like that seems wasteful to me. Just my two cents

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:31

It wouldn't be "using an item flag"
it'd be a new flag, just like the `Can use while sideview swimming` one dimi added
since it's the same for all items

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:33

So it'd be expanding the size of all items by one bit?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:33

well, expansions happen in bytes
and there might still be spare flags from the last byte available

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:35

Still, my point being you want to keep itemdata at a reasonable size. If it were me I'd heavily question the necessity of every feature that uses it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:35

increasing the size of itemdata by 1 byte
is 256 bytes total
adding a single new global script slot
eats several thousand bytes

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:36

And bloats the UI to include more flags and makes the experience worse for the end user

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:36

so many other things that don't get any consideration add far more
the memory isn't a big deal at this small a scale
init data labels add like 65* more
just for items

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 00:37

bloats the ui???

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:37

and, the item editor is in the new gui system, where we can easily manage things.... adding a single checkbox is not going to bloat anything noticably

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909599232309223525/909603080620875787/unknown.png?ex=65e517e2&is=65d2a2e2&hm=5133eaf6de6b37b3cf50993a106e9f1be32cdea04eb1005defc1a07d62345269&)
one more checkbox here won't hurt anything

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:38

Right, there's plenty of space _right now_

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:38

and, we can always add more tabs

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:38

I'm just saying don't fall victim to the mentality that gave us the rules menu

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 00:38

Will this ZC even be developed in one more year?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:38

I'd probably add a `1`/`2` subtab to the `Flags` tab, where the main 16 are on the first one, and the rest are on the next
if it got to the point of needing that

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:39

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Will this ZC even be develope…"): A very good question. If things are wrapping up I'd be even more hesitant about new features
Anyways, I've rambled enough. Sorry about that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:39

The question is how difficult it would be to add, and how likely it would be to cause issues
and, knowing the systems involved, and based on my detailed outline above
this would be easier to add than adding configurable flipper dive length
which was done in a day at P-tux's request over a year ago
*large scale* features, and *major system rewrites*, are the big things to worry about as relates to getting things finished
this is a simple, minor addition that, with minimal effort, would give people a major feature from LTTP

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 00:41

(replying to @ Moosh "I'm just saying don't fall vi…"): Also, what mentality?
A lot of rules were developed before the item editor became a thing. If a lot of people wanted bombs to hurt Link, Phantom Menace would be doing them a disservice to not let that happen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:41

^
and compat rules are required to keep old quests working

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 00:42

(now, I don't necessarily want Bunny Link, I was just going to put the tiles in the classic tileset because there's a janky scriptless way to do it)
but if Emily wants to do it I can't stop her

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:42

it's just a good idea, and should be simpler than most things I've done recently
one of those things where `huh, why didn't we already have this? It's super simple...` and it's just because no one thought of it

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:43

That mentality being adding things at a moments notice with no regards for greater structure. Basically nobody understands the rules menu. It's a great big mess, too many checkboxes some of which do nonsensible things. It harms the user experience

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:43

That's why we are adding help text
because, relying purely on a single-line name to convey all the information, is indeed bad design
especially with how poorly some were named

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:44

Indeed
Though it's still a system people will no doubt tl;dr

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:44

the information will be there if they want it
instead of people sitting there going `WTF does this even do????`
regardless, I would think the bunny, especially being implemented similarly to LTTP, would make a lot of intuitive sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:46

pffft, apparently dmap flags are 32-bit already

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:46

😩

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:46

so there's 12 free flags without needing to increase anything, there
and items have 6 free flags, similarly

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:47

Something else I forgot to bring up: LTMs are a fucking nightmare to explain to new users for some reason

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:48

yeah... a help button on the LTM field in the item editor would probably be good

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:48

I think it's a good system, but something about it is inherently difficult to approach. Maybe people don't grasp the concept of addition

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:48

I feel like the confusing part is that only the highest level item of each type applies

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:49

That makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:49

so if you grab 2 shields, they DON'T add
but a shield and a tunic, DO

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:49

Also the dumb fucking rule that makes them ignore up facing sprites 🤦

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:49

🤢
yep
on by default, now, but tilesets be tilesets

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:50

Stuff like this is what I hate about rules. ZC has been built on these principles of backwards compatibility. Decent for retaining old talent, atrocious for attracting new
There's so many little snags that turn away new users because _things weren't done right the first time_

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:51

Should they use the ruleset dialog to pick the modern ruleset, it would set all the right rules for them
that *does* pop up by default when creating a *new* quest
but tilesets are, inherently, *not new quests*

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:52

yup
Would it break anything if it gave that prompt when loading a quest saved in an older version?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:52

if people update tilesets for 2.55, that will become less and less of an issue
it could be annoying
and in many tilesets, using it might break things that were set up

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:53

mhm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:53

for instance, disabling A/B subscreen, toggling animation rules, etc
and tilesets might rely on old bugs, as well
for instance, the broken `SkipY` combo animation

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:53

Perhaps at some point we should have a tileset update initiative

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:54

aye, that would be the solution, is to get tilesets saved in the new version, with new tiles/combos for the new features

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:54

To bring the most popular tilesets up to modern standards. Add in all the new items, enable modern fixes, ect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:54

which is kinda what we are doing with classic right now
#1170

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:54

Well Classic being compatible is kinda an expectation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:55

basically just need tileset makers to do the same for theirs
things like including crystal switch combos, sign combos, etc

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:55

Shame they're all gone 😄

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:57

but anyway, the problems are not with `adding too many new things`
they are with `adding things in poor ways`
and we've been doing our best to add things more sanely for 2.55

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 00:58

I suppose

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 01:06

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 01:22

So, basically, implementing this
I'm just adding the bunny check everywhere that the magic cost of an item is checked
basically checked for every item, including rings/scrolls

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 01:31

...letters don't appear to respect cost

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 01:40

*oh my fucking god*
so, items like magic containers and such can have LTMs
....but they use *hardcoded item IDs for what item to read*
what the fuck

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 01:44

what
who would do that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 01:44

no fucking idea
but, because it uses hardcoded IDs
if you took, say, the default compass item ID, and made it a shield, giving it an LTM
that LTM.... would apply on any dmap where you have the compass......
major bug to fix

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 01:47

I guess at the very least this one doesn't need a rule because nobody in their right mind would replace the map/compass and then move them somewhere else

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 01:47

someone very well could have
in fact, I want to say in LGA3 I literally wiped the quest file clean, including tiles/palettes/items/enemies, when I started
so *I* may have
so it most certainly needs a rule

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 01:48

Oh. I guess I underestimated how crazy you are 😛
How do you even wipe that stuff without a ton of busywork?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 01:49

pressing delete a bunch of times
you can delete every tile in a single delete press if you select all the pages
palettes are simple enough to clear

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 01:50

casually changing the zelda's room fire enemy's stats to a 40-headed fire gleeok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 01:56

new qr is `Hardcoded LItem/Bomb/Clock/Magic LTMs`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:05

OK, so now, that should be fixed
and for each item, it checks that *either* link is not a bunny, *or* the item is usable as a bunny, before adding the ltm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 02:11

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) how hard would it be to add something like the "disabled items" thing from dmaps into the item editor?
Not particularly important for the moon pearl, though that could use it, but would be very useful for, say, sideview swimming and flippers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:12

err, you'll need to be more specific on what you want

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 02:16

specific flippers allowing specific items in sideview swimming

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:16

. . . . not really
that would be.... quite difficult
you can't add it to the flipper item itself
unless you add the same amount of memory use to literally all 256 items

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 02:18

which is... 256 / 8 bits per byte = 32 bytes
times 256
8192 bytes, or 8 kb

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:18

keeping in mind that whatever tab you add for it would be for all items
and you'd want to, like, implement it in a way that other items might be able to... use somehow?
Otherwise, it's just kinda a clutter
and, a script could handle it by toggling the `Disabled in Sideview Water` flag for a bunch of items
which would be much simpler
and less engine-cluttery

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 02:21

trying to think of if other item classes would benefit from having flags for each item
Moon Pearl, obviously, cause same logic as sideview swimming
but besides that...
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and less engine-cluttery"): though, keep in mind the tab could just be hidden if it's not relevant.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:22

think,
```cpp
void checkFlippers()
{
    int itemid = GetHighestLevelItemOwned(IC_FLIPPERS);
    switch(itemid)
    {
        case IT_FLIPPERS2:
        {
            Game->LoadItemData(IT_SWORD)->SideswimDisabled = false;
            break;
        }
        default:
        {
            Game->LoadItemData(IT_SWORD)->SideswimDisabled = true;
            break;
        }
    }
}```
something along those lines could work perfectly fine as a script
without needing to add a whole bunch of jank crap to the engine

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 02:24

yeah, fair
I'm more just going "well, if other item classes might use it, I see no reason not to add it"
but I'm struggling to think of any

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:24

and, most quests would probably not care for more than one setting
keep in mind that with your idea
they would need to duplicate the setting
to every single flipper
making setup much more difficult

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 02:25

oh, yeah, that's tedious

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:25

With a script, they'd need the same.... but only if they want to use a script to do something like that
so, it becomes their choice, rather than forced
Given, you *could* eat an item flag on that.... but that's just more jankiness
Now, something like that for the *rewrite*, with better systems in place from the start? Perhaps
but adding more janky jank mc jank to this version doesn't seem worthwhile

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 02:28

whimsical ring could benefit from it, as a "this affects these items to critical hit"... no, that's not worth it

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 02:34

so engine bunny isn't memory-intensive?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:34

it's taking one of the 6 still-free item flags
and one of the 12 still-free dmap flags
so, adds 0 memory, since there's already some spare
total usage is `(256 + 512)/8 = 96` bytes

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 02:35

ooh we have 12 free dmap flags?
maybe there should be a thread in #deleted-channel or #deleted-channel about what people would have in mind for them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:36

there are 12 unused bits of `dmapdata.flags`
because, it's an `int`, so 32-bit
and only 20 flags are used

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 02:36

though, how many script-reserved dmap flags do we have?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:36

5

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 02:36

hmm
if zc development starts winding down might be worth giving over another 5

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:37

....to just use them because they exist isn't the best idea, for the record
because, then if we have something else come up that needs them, we need to expand, taking more memory
If there's a legitimate reason to want them, then sure; like making a dmap be a bunny dmap, perfect sense as a dmap flag

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 02:38

yeah what i'm asking is if there's other things that people have been wanting as dmap flags all this time
and if we should ask the userbase that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:39

if there are any proper good ideas, then sure
that's... kinda what #deleted-channel is for

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 02:39

true but i think some people like me just assumed that that part was packed full
or that it'd be ornery to add

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 02:40

no reason to think that
the only things we've ever mentioned being tight to add are things that add to `screen` and `ffc`
because map count is a huge problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:17

OK, so
```cpp
int Hero->BunnyClk;
 * Returns the number of frames for which the player will be a Bunny.
 * If -1, the effect will be removed by the engine if the current
 *     dmap does not have the bunny flag, or the player possesses a pearl item.
 * If <-1, the effect will last until script-modified
 * If >0, will tick down each frame```
this should be *mostly* finished
except, I still need to do the gui for the item and dmap flags

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 05:18

Do other ZScript things use the Clk abbreviation? I know it's on a lot of internal stuff but I can't think of many ZScript ones

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:18

...not many
`combodata->AClk`

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 05:18

Might be better to call it BunnyTimer or something

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:19

most things just don't have an abbrev
`Hero->Stun`, with no reference that it's a timer of any sort
I like `Clk`, because it's shorter to type repeatedly
while still labeling that it is in some form a timer/clock

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 05:19

It is, but for the learning user it can be guesswork what they mean

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:20

well I mean

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 05:20

especially in the non native English speaking community

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:20

there's an entire paragraph there
eh, true

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 05:20

ooh since combos can spawn enemies now
should we add that chasing thing from lttp
("rabbit beam")

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:21

That is an idea
I personally don't want to touch enemy code
but, I kept things like that in mind here
thus why values > 0 tick down over time
and the pearl does not affect them
pearl only affects value `-1`
which is set by the dmap flag
positive values would be for things like that, which temporarily bunny you
and values `<-1` would be available for scripts to force you to stay a bunny until the script says otherwise

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 05:26

Would this be added to touch effects for enemies that have that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:26

that would make sense

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 05:26

If so...
red/blue bunny bubbles: how would those work? 🙃

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:27

. . . . like, bunny until you hit another one?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 05:28

hit a red bubble, you're permabunnied until you hit a blue bubble

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:28

....let me reserve `-2` as well

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 05:28

And I imagine leaving and exiting a bunny dmap wouldn't reset it
but also, hitting a blue bubble in a bunny dmap wouldn't make you unbunnied (or rather, it would, but you'd still be bunnied until you left)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:29

that'd be why it needs a separate value

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 05:29

Yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:29

for the record, it can just unbunny you
and then LinkClass::animate will immediately re-bunny you for the dmap

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 05:29

ohh, yeah
that does make sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:29

it checks every frame
in case, say, you gained or lost a pearl
```
int BunnyClk;
 * Returns the number of frames for which the player will be a Bunny.
 * If -1, the effect will be removed by the engine if the current
 *     dmap does not have the bunny flag, or the player possesses a pearl item.
 * -2 through -99 reserved for potential future engine use
 * If <-100, the effect will last until script-modified
 * If >0, will tick down each frame```
might as well reserve a few values

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 05:31

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "in case, say, you gained or l…"): oh yeah, smart
okay, next question
bunny link would have different graphics, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:31

LTM, set in Init Data

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 05:31

Is there like a bunny LTM in the ini- okay
👍

`Game->Generic[]`, like most recent init data additions
and, any item that does not have the `"Usable as a Bunny"` flag will not apply it's LTM while bunnied

...I don't think I did that for sideview swimming

```cpp
    int32_t get_watergrav();
    void set_watergrav(int32_t val);
    
    int32_t get_sideswim_up();
    void set_sideswim_up(int32_t val);
    
    int32_t get_sideswim_side();
    void set_sideswim_side(int32_t val);
    
    int32_t get_sideswim_down();
    void set_sideswim_down(int32_t val);
    
    int32_t get_sideswim_jump();
    void set_sideswim_jump(int32_t val);```
seems like you did
might not have added the std_constants, haven't looked there yet

I mean the LTMs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:37

err, I wouldn't expect that to apply to sideview swimming
sideview swimming uses its' own sprites
not its' own LTM
the reason I made the bunny mode kill the LTMs for items, is because the Bunny LTM should be based off of the base link tiles
...I suppose you could do it for sideview swimming, but I wouldn't have *expected* it to be done

k
that doesn't look that bad
now for the dmap flag.... which is *old gui*....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:23

OKAY

LINK BE PURPLE

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 06:24

That small mode menu looks dope

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:24

(I have the bunny LTM set to an 8-bit version of the link tiles that is purple)
And I can't swing the sword
but I can swing the wand, as it has the flag set
and it works entirely as normal
once I grab the lovely purple fire that is a moon pearl.....

suddenly I'm back to normal
shield LTM was not applying in bunny mode, as expected
and immediately applies after
....there's only *ONE* issue
I don't appear as a bunny during the opening wipe, as it hasn't yet checked the dmap for the bunny state.... so I need to add a check for continuing on a bunny dmap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:27

aside from that one thing it seems to be mostly working, though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:35

boy I love it
when you add a couple lines of code
and suddenly *the fucking program stops launching*
.....rebuild from clean time.......

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:42

lmfoa

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:42

oh ffs
it wasn't a clean issue
I checked where `Link.init()` was called, and all 3 calls looked safe for the code I added
....I forgot that `LinkClass::LinkClass` called `init()` on construction......

viola, bunny during opening wipe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:53

...I think this is done
so, yeah, pretty damn easy addition

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:58

wait the functionality's already done? today?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:59

Like I said, easy
