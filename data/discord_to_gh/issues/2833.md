Conveyor belt combos that force the player to face one direction apply this effect permanently, even when the player is not walking on the combo anymore. This persists through screen transitions and map transitions. 

Conveyor belt combos that stun the player also have their effect permanently apply to the player, functionally soft-locking the player.

Yeah this bug entirely breaks my quest, since almost every house door uses conveyors to emulate LTTP style house doors.

=== @ Moosh 11/08/2023 19:34

@ Phosphor  When was the last build you used before updating? Seeing what I think broke it, but that's been broken for quite a while if so...

=== @ Phosphor 11/08/2023 19:45

(replying to @ Moosh "@ Phosphor  When w…"): October 28th
Thankfully I haven't overwritten my quest yet from that version

=== @ Moosh 11/08/2023 19:46

okay...

=== @ Phosphor 11/08/2023 19:46

Emily did some work with conveyors not too long ago getting them to work on FFCs
maybe it broke then?

=== @ Moosh 11/08/2023 19:46

Not sure when it broke then. Because there are just variables for freezing and dir that are just never getting unset when you step off the conveyor

=== @ Moosh 11/08/2023 20:22

One of these variables also seems like it's supposed to be a clock as it's being set to the conveyor's rate, but it's never actually decrementing
```        if(forcewalk)
        {
            is_conveyor_stunned = rate;
            if((cmb->usrflags&cflag3) && !spins)
            {
                if(abs(deltax) > abs(deltay))
                    conv_forcedir = dir = (deltax > 0) ? right : left;
                else conv_forcedir = dir = (deltay > 0) ? down : up;
            }
            convey_forcex = deltax;
            convey_forcey = deltay;
        }```
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) do you recall if this was the intent?

The commit that introduced it:
https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/41e5f184f50f45ab7c9e91005bc5008a17b996df

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/08/2023 20:28

(replying to @ Moosh "One of these variables also s…"): It should last as long as the player is on the conveyor

=== @ Moosh 11/08/2023 20:28

Hmm...having it decrement sorta fixes a bug, but conveyors with rate are SUPER cursed still
because it'll freeze Link in place but won't _start_ the freezing until it hits the frame the conveyor is being checked
So if I say were to set a super large rate like a full second, he can just walk right over the conveyor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/08/2023 20:33

(replying to @ Moosh "So if I say were to set a sup…"): Well yeah, that'd be just how that works

=== @ Moosh 11/08/2023 20:33

So this is intended behavior?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/08/2023 20:37

(replying to @ Moosh "So this is intended behavior?"): For long rates being jank, yeah
For it stunning you forever, obviously not

=== @ Moosh 11/08/2023 20:41

Okay. Rate on the whole is jank as a concept, but I was just playing with potential applications for it. For now pushing a fix to the immediate issue

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2023 05:25

that's annoying; it should respect rate
will have to look into
