I figured it would run on the fire weapon, instead it ran ZC to a dead stop ü§£

Fortunately writing the same effect is easy as just putting the script on the wand instead and waiting for the weapon to die

...oh fun
the book fire has `isLWeapon == false`
so it's trying to run it as an eweapon script
but when that fetches the attached weapon as an eweapon, it gets a nullptr because no such thing exists....
