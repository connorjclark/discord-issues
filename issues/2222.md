i have a feeling i reported a similar bug like this a year or so ago and it's resurfaced... *again* lmao 

however this one changes the parameters upon opening the FFC editor. negative whole values, like -1, -4 etc seem to work fine. anything between -x.1 to -x.9 is where it occurs.

found this in that march 3 nightly/that hotfix from the other day emily sent across, but it is also in the latest nightly (march 5).

actually it looks like the whole thing is just broken. putting in random numbers and getting these values back:
-1.9 -> -0.91
-2.31 -> 1.969
-6.9 (nice) -> -5.91

=== @ tacochopper 03/06/2023 14:27

if the editor remains unopened the values stay the same and work fine

uhg wtf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/07/2023 02:30

how long back, if you can try to check?

=== @ tacochopper 03/07/2023 06:25

not present in 15-2, or 22-2 for that matter
so relatively recent

=== @ tacochopper 03/08/2023 11:54

further, accidental testing - opening the FFC editor on the `flags` or `scripts` tabs does not cause this bug to happen!

?????

=== @ tacochopper 03/08/2023 11:55

yeah ikr

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2023 11:55

.....OH
For FUCKS

=== @ tacochopper 03/08/2023 11:55

omg what

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2023 11:55

Thank you for that, I now have a very good idea where to look

=== @ tacochopper 03/08/2023 11:55

yeah, was just fiddling with some scripted stuff on another screen and came back
and was like "... huh"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2023 11:55

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> my stupidity strikes again
It's getting the draw message before the start message

=== @ tacochopper 03/08/2023 11:56

aahhhhh i was wondering cos the `scripts` tab was flashing briefly upon open

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2023 11:56

Which, if it's HIDDEN, it doesn't get a draw message at all

=== @ tacochopper 03/08/2023 11:56

assume that's the draw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2023 22:46

Fixed
