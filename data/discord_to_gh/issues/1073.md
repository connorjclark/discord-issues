If we're talking about GUI improvements I think it would a good and sensible idea to move under combos to the secret combos tab

This is smart

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 22:17

Ideally in the misc subtab in secret combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:17

but, it'll wait until we redesign the secret combo dialog
because, we're converting everything to a new dialog system here
so it requires a lot of rewriting of the various pieces

I saw your GUI discussions and I felt I ought to contribute in my own way

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 22:19

I got maybe a few more GUI improvement ideas to suggest

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 22:23

Infact maybe there should be a general gui discussion thread in new-gui-plans because I don't think the feature request category is ideal for throwing gui related idea and bouncing 'em off.
I can sorta visualize how a consolidation of the title and side warp category would like in my head

I just allowed thread creation in #deleted-channel

=== @ NightmareJames 10/02/2021 22:43

I give my blessing to this.  Under Combos can be easily forgotten

I wonder if this also means we'd free up a Hotkey.  F10 or F11, since it'll all be in one screen.
Then again, people use warps so often that having a hotkey that goes directly to that tab will be very helpful, rather than having to click one more time to go to another warp tab.
