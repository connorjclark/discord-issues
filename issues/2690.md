@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) (you've got the most experience with font stuffs)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2023 22:09

the commit range that issue references is ZQ-only stuff?
or, err
I suppose it did refactor the system for the globals
but nothing should have really CHANGED outside of ZQ
the fact that it's subscreen related would indicate more recent changes than that being likely, except, the report is OLDER than the subscreen rewrite, so that can't be either

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 22:11

I did confirm the bisect btw so it is def. this change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2023 22:11

I haven't the first idea
all that should have changed is
instead of having like 50 global variables
there's now a global array
which is accessed by indexes
Which fonts are involved here? (which should it be using, and which is it actually using?)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 22:38

The current editor lists font 000 Zelda NES. So does the new one.
Looking at the images in the github thread, are both the same font but different scale?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2023 22:38

that shouldn't be a *thing*
nothing in zc relates in any way to scale...
but
I mean
it could

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2023 22:40

....oh
`init_custom_fonts` is called in zc normally
that... I don't think was intentional

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2023 22:41

....so, idea
try changing that so any of the things that are reading `App::zquest` configs, always return the default value in ZC instead of reading the configs?
(in `init_custom_fonts`, specifically)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 23:49

no effect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2023 23:50

Then no idea

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 23:50

bisecting the commits now..

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2023 00:21

this is the ss font id being used in old version https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/bf63e3beaece5c1d8339cbd224507d052792f1a4#diff-c4a58926da7dba31c26bfddc915150762b525d668a17e00bf7e2fb6e15733621L3591-L3593
`ssfPROP`, which maps to `font`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2023 00:25

which is `fontsdata[FONT_GUI_PROP]`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 00:25

oh
it was fucking
mapping to `font` before
that's fun

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2023 00:25

https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/bf63e3beaece5c1d8339cbd224507d052792f1a4#diff-f0b3d081799a104ffc3d7aefd22f31f517135ce2f8075dc9bfb9976c8d2fbfa8L487

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 00:25

that's the global bullshit variable that gets changed god knows where

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2023 00:25

but `font = nfont` was rm
so should be able to map ssPROP with nfont now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2023 00:32

That fixed it. Let's see what the replays have to say about it.
Should pass, as otherwise it would have failed when this was first changed.
