Currently only DMaps with the spacebar map enabled have functioning ST_VISITED. This is dumb and arbitrary. This was always dumb and arbitrary. Can there be a behavior change + compat rule for this?

Technically this might be a bug report, I'm giving whoever coded spacebar map too much credit in thinking they did this on purpose. But yeah
