As of the latest nightly I've ran into a problem where sensitive and stair warps placed under a layer 1 ground tile no longer teleports the player like it should. I use this particular trick for the world gates in my side project and I have reasons to think this might also affect trigger combos concealed under layer 1

=== @ Moosh 05/12/2022 02:05

None of your combos layered over the stairs would happen to be bridge combos, would they? because that sounds like bridge combo

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/12/2022 03:51

No, they are not bridge comboes

Is there an FFC over the warp?

No

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/13/2022 18:34

I think I ought to DM you my current dev build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/13/2022 18:36

that would probably be good
because I can't replicate the issue
so

layering a ground tile over a warp combo doesn't stop the warp from working

Actual bug
the qr swapping wavy and cancel warps (compat for 1.92) was checked
so it was doing a cancel warp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/13/2022 23:10

as this is, here, the intended behavior, no bug found. Gotta check your compat rules!
