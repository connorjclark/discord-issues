Not sure how easy this would be to add, but it would be greatly appreciated if when viewing the combo sheet, along with the options of editing, inserting, removing, deleting, etc. combos, an option to en masse apply an offset to all selected combos' tiles. By that, I mean if the user inputs an offset of 260, all selected combos have their tile selections moved forward by one full page. This would make setting up multiple dungeon wall sets way easier, among other things.

Can't you mass combo a tile page and then copy a page of combos' attributes? Might be one of those weird shortcuts though

I've been mass copying and having to individually edit each combo and offset it by 1 page
It covers all the properties of the tiles, but not the actual graphic
