For some reason, when I try to type a number in the box `00`, it puts in one number like `03` but then you can't type another number. Luckily we can click the box for now.

@ Jared

=== @ Jared 12/30/2023 22:49

Hmmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/30/2023 22:49

if the box has 2 digits in it, you kinda need to backspace to type more, like you would in any other box

=== @ Jared 12/30/2023 22:50

This is after I backspace BOTH

Then I can't do anything
It basically only lets me put one number and a zero appears before it no matter what I do

Thank you I’ll try it
Yeah warping in general is SO broken

(replying to @ Jared "Yeah warping in general is SO…"): ?

=== @ Jared 01/01/2024 00:21

Oh lol
Random comment
But year warping with interior maps is so broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 00:43

?

(replying to @ Jared "But year warping with interio…"): In what way?  The more details (and screenshots) you can give, the better.  This is an open-ended comment that can be interpreted in any number of ways.

=== @ Jared 01/01/2024 12:10

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "In what way?  The more detail…"): I can answer later! Basically the numbers don’t match up with the screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 12:12

(replying to @ Jared "I can answer later! Basically…"): ... Do you mean the x-offset of the dmap?

=== @ Jared 01/01/2024 12:21

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "... Do you mean the x-offset…"): Yes
With the minimal and warping

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 12:22

... Do you have any squares selected on the dmap's grid for showing them on the dungeon map?
If you do so, it should look a lot more clear, lol

=== @ Jared 01/01/2024 21:48

Yes
Let me check it out
