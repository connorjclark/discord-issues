I realise messing with the old combo types is not a good idea due to older quests relying on them, so I'm suggesting a single new mirror combo type that is customizable.

Current mirror combos, say the / one. It's reflective on both sides. And I kinda want mirror tiles that are only reflective on one side. so, one that goes left/up, but has no reflective property on right/down, etc.

Adding this the regular way would result in 4 new combo types though, which feels bulky for no reason. So a single combo type that lets you customise with it's variables what happens if something enters it from any given direction.

Realistically, being able to set what direction a weapon will move in after reflection, for each direction it could take in, would be nice
Though that does nothing to account for angular shit, obviously
... Also could use triggers tab for what weapons get reflected?

=== @ vlamart 09/09/2023 12:46

Maybe something similar to how slopes sets up a solid line, maybe a similar green line in the effects box could represent that. Or maybe a whole new coloured line to represent reflectivity

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/09/2023 12:46

that doesn't really work
to use a line like that implies basically the mirrors we already have
and wouldn't give you anything different
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Realistically, being able to‚Ä¶"): the idea behind here would be like
right-facing weapon hits this, it goes up
and that can be the only interaction
...you could make a rotator, where right-facing weapons go up, down-facing weapons go right, left-facing go down, and up-facing go left
or a one-way, where right-facing weapons and left-facing weapons BOTH go right
that type of idea would be a LOT more flexible

=== @ vlamart 09/09/2023 12:50

Because I was recently thinking of sideview stuff and light puzzles, and just 4 directions seems limiting, diagonals would be nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/09/2023 12:57

8dir might be doable
Angular is pain
And like, not really doable customisably
... Though uhh
Light puzzles have no handling for diagonals
So that would require rewriting almost all of light puzzles
Which uhh... I'm absolutely not doing that
And I feel like other devs won't want to touch it either (though obviously I can't read their minds)

=== @ vlamart 09/09/2023 13:04

Fair enough

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2023 01:09

(replying to @ vlamart "Because I was recently thinki‚Ä¶"): also, just a note here

for 4-directions, this takes 16 tiles to set up, because it's `2^4` tiles
...to add diagonals, that makes 8 dirs, for a total of `2^8` or `256` tiles to set up.

=== @ vlamart 09/11/2023 01:11

That would be messy üòù

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2023 01:17

exactly lol
so, diagonal light beams are uh, not likely

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2023 02:27

bwahahahhahaha

the diagonals are only for weapons, not lightbeams

a 45¬∞ reflection, with proper graphic
(this requires a change in tile for the `Magic` sprite, you need to add a third tile facing up-left)

ooo, hype

I might be a little bit fucking INSANE
(this was a lot of work, and probably the last of the light beam stuff at least for a while)

=== @ vlamart 09/11/2023 17:02

These will make the dopest puzzles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2023 17:03

(replying to @ vlamart "These will make the dopest pu‚Ä¶"): I truly look forward to seeing that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2023 17:11

@ Majora when you have the time, could you possibly record a new replay or few (added to the `playground.qst`) that test a bunch of the light beam stuff (various triggers and such, including moving ffc beams like above, both still and moving targets, various types of the normal mirrors, and some of the new `Mirror (Custom)`s)?
(be sure to have all the compat rules off, and on the next nightly that is not currently out yet or later)

=== @ Majora 09/11/2023 18:31

Sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2023 18:52

awesome
