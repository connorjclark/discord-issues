I have heard a lot about people talking about NES inconsistencies as of lately that are not true bugs in ZC, so I wanted to address it
Before the changeover in power structure, we had talks of fixing it, but mostly in the 1st and 2nd quest only, as it would affect too many questmakers and how their quests were designed, especially older ones, as it could entirely break them.
Please post here, what they are, and how they are, so they can be addressed, but if they deviate too much, they could be scripts or quest rules designed mostly for the 1st or 2nd quests

And in particular @ P-Tux7 @ Mitsukara and @ 4matsy , though the conversation is welcome to anyone

=== @ NightmareJames 09/14/2021 22:18

Ones that I particularly am keen/aware of at the moment:
1.  Blue Leeder drops
2.  Wizzrobe patterns
3.  10th Enemy has the Bomb
I'm sure there's more

=== @ P-Tux7 09/14/2021 22:21

Zoria already made an enemy drops/10th enemy has the bomb script

While I'm not too concerned about the inconsistencies, and this would be one of the most difficult, on NES the Patras wrapped around the screen edge (so if a patra eye went offscreen, it appeared on the opposite side of the screen). Sounds like kind of a nightmare to implement on purpose with the way ZC handles X/Y coordinates not being a rollover (or at least, the range extending well beyond the screen edge), though.

Also on NES, the 2nd Patra kid that spawns is the one that controls the orbiting patterns. User PresJPolk refers to this lil' guy as the "magic orbiter" in a post on the speedrun.com Zelda 1 forum: https://www.speedrun.com/post/2k4j8
So anyway, this magic orbiter. If you happen to kill it earlier than the other Patra kids, the orbiting pattern of the kids gets stuck - Big Circle Patra's kids will either never pulse in and out again, or do so repeatedly without end; while Oval Patra's kids will do their weird elliptical pattern thingie over and over...or not.
Should you happen to kill Oval Patra's magic orbiter kid on the rightmost edge of its orbit...welp, maybe you should stop swinging that sword and observe the madness that unfolds. ü§™ The remaining kids will detach from the leader and start wrapping the screen. Repeatedly, if you let them. It's pretty hilarious. ü§£ üòÇ

oh i also forgot

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 04:07

some things that i don't particularly care to see fixed:
-item hitboxes for sword collection
-sword being unequal on left and right (killing a darknut from the left while facing downward is easier than when it comes from the right)
-wand melee hitbox is FUCKED
-boomerang spawns like a tile in front of link
and one that could do with fixing - i think on nes you can have multiple fairy enemy drops on screen at once

=== @ 4matsy 09/15/2021 04:28

You sure can. I saw a TAS get 5 fairies at once by bombing a bunch of octoroks near the level 1 bridge :o

=== @ 4matsy 09/15/2021 04:30

Apparently, the way forced good drops work, if you kill multiple enemies on the same frame with a bomb, they all drop the same forced good drop.

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 04:31

oh yeah that's how i just got 2 fairies today by killing 2 enemies at the same time

=== @ 4matsy 09/15/2021 04:32

Oh, btw, speaking of killing multiple enemies with bombs:
You know how Manhandla speeds up after each head is blown off? Well, if you blow off multiple heads with one bomb in the same frame, he's only supposed to speed up by one notch (50 step speed in ZC, I think?), not multiple.

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 07:06

You can't have multiple fairies in ZC at once????
That sounds like something that would be ideal to improve _in general_, not just for NES accuracy
I wonder if a script can spawn multiples, or if they just don't work together

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 07:07

i think phantom menace's idea was that you can't spawn other fairies while one's on-screen in zelda 1, right?
but there's also the dropping on the same frame quirk in zelda 1, and the spawn limitation would be advisable to remove for "modernized" quests anyways

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 07:10

You can spawn multiples if you spawn them with a script, I just tested
but enemies will never drop two, huh? Time to test that next I suppose

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 07:13

Okay, this is super weird. So I have this unscripted field of 10 stalfos with an item drop set that's just 100% a fairy (moving)
If I leave the screen and kill one, it will always spawn a fairy
most of the time when I kill more, it won't spawn another fairy until the first one is gone.... but occasionally it will???????

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 07:15

fixing that behaviour is its own conundrum, but i'd call the priority just a QR to allow infinite fairies to coexist

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 07:23

I added a bug report about this whole subject if you want to see it. https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/887599395028213791/887599398509486101
