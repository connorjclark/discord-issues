First noticed due to test mode "forgetting" it's filepath if it encountered a load quest error at any point. Traced back using debug to this issue:

something is not set up right here and I'm not sure what
...I'm not sure if what I screenshotted is actually the issue at all

but something is seriously fucky with these save headers

Reproduction steps:
1. Test a quest.
2. While test mode is open for that quest, delete/rename the quest file.
3. `F9` to Reset Game
4. Popup: Error loading quest [correct path]
5. Popup: Error loading quest [incorrect path], repeats infinitely (until you close, which does not require task mgr thankfully)

(second error example:

notice that there is no filename, as it's trying to load the quest path `""`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 23:53

it's the end result of this logic https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/blob/main/src/zc/zelda.cpp#L1516
we should just exit if this is test mode
and file does not exist

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/27/2023 23:55

except no we should not
If you reset test mode *while ZQ is in the process of saving*, this error occurs quite often
which the correct solution is to retry

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 23:56

Better to change ZQ to write to a temporary file and then move it when done.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/27/2023 23:56

either way, this issue is ocurring constantly while testing, and not just for me
as long as that stops all is good, however you do it
this has gotten in my way while debugging other issues quite a bit

(meta) thread name was changed: Test mode interrupted when qst file is written
