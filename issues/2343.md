The addition of Death Type and Death Attribute 1 to the Aquamentus and Gohma classes (and possibly Patras too?) to tie in with #2342so that a series of two or more Aquamentus/Gohma enemies can be made via splitting to simulate the boss evolving after it takes a certain amount of damage, similar to the Aquamentus in BS Zelda and the bosses in The Legend of Amy Rose 2 quest. Of course, Aquamenti can't really evolve much for now due to not having other shot types, but it would still work well for Gohmas, and all that in due time.

(this is also going to be integrated into one of James' quests if it gets added, that's how I got the idea)

I LOVE this idea! Would make more interesting bosses too
