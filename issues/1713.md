Yeah, that uh
that's been broken since Zoria edited it
in November 2019
it isn't included by default, so, it wouldn't be noticed without someone trying to use it
...clearly no one had.
@ Deathrider you should just be able to edit the file to fix yourself
just change
`void GetSystemTime(char32 buffer[])`
to
`void GetSystemTime(char32 buffer)`
the `[]` at the end is a typo on Zoria's part

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíSyntax Errors in engine files
or like, just take this

but that's the only change
