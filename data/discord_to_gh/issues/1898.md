Some people might want combos to animate when the screen is frozen, some might not. Original discussion: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876908472728453161/1021865696809984100

To not, you can simply `Game->Suspend[susptsusptCOMBOANIM] = true;` to suspend it
so really just need to enable it in a way that won't break old quests that might have relied on it not animating

maybe you could add `Game->EnableOverrided[Blah]` which would work no matter what Game->Suspend is set to? Idk what kinda implications there would be for that though.

huh
you
you just set suspend to false
why would you need another thing

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/20/2022 19:49

You were saying that you would need a way to implement this so it doesn't break old quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/20/2022 19:49

yes, that's called a compat qr

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 09/20/2022 19:49

Fair enough
