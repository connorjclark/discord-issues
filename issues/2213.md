latest nightly presenting this lovely visual error. 

if you hold the left mouse button down you can drag the cursor over to select the button, so at least they still work

(meta) thread name was changed: combo and tile editor menu buttons glitched

Oh for FUCKS
<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>
I know the problem immediately at least

=== @ tacochopper 03/03/2023 14:01

lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/03/2023 14:02

this is why I post nightlies as I go with this upgrade
because every time I do something it breaks old shit
and I can't re-test everything constantly lol

... goddamnit, what's the workaround when windows says it's a virus?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:09

Tell it to run anyway

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:41

smh it is just not complying

guess im gonna restart and see what the fuck happens, i hate windows

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:41

Oh what the fuck is that popup
that's one I've never seen before

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:41

bulldog hours
the devs finally did it. they put a bulldog in ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:41

...does the `...` have anything useful?
if not, turn off windows defender?
It's being a bit of a virus itself lol

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:42

might be the best way to circumvent this hey

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:42

(antivirus software is, itself, the biggest virus)

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:43

the three dots is literally "see fewer notifications" btw lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:43

pffft
yeah, windows is being a total piece of crap

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:44

ahh hmmmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:44

oh, you need to use a 64 bit build folder

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:45

weird, i am

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:45

oh??
....wtf??

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:45

well, i *should be*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:45

I'd double check that
since that's the only thing I've seen give errors like that

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:45

... doh i'm a fucking idiot
i downloaded the 32 bit build of the 3-3 nightly last night

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:46

thaat'd do it
can't mix 32b/64b

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:46

how the fuck did i manage that lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:46

to the point where it literally would take an entire second compiler setup for me to locally make 32b builds
effectively a second install of the entire compile chain

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:48

anyway this is all fixed lol
my antics aside
