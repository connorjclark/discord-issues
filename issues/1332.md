@ DeletedUser ran into this one during the recent stream of HeroOfFire's 4th quest. I checked ZC's 1st.qst on a hunch, and the bug happens there too.

It's easiest to see on the screens with the red leevers a few screens to the right of the starting point. Get the wooden sword, then head right a few screens until you reach the coast screens with the red leevers. With any luck, one of them - that isn't the last one 😒 - will drop a clock, and you can see the bug in action. The leevers just keep right on moving despite the clock being picked up.
