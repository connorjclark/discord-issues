Since Shields are the de facto way of making/printing characters, why don't we put player defenses right on them?  Is this possible, or are player defenses hardcoded right into the player class?  Let me know.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2022 02:03

The problem is, this means we would need to add a ton more to the itemdata struct
which bloats EVERY SINGLE ITEM
there isn't a way to add something 'just to shields'
other than the 10 misc attributes, which is nowhere near enough for defenses, and half of which are already in use for block flags

(replying to @ NightmareJames "Since Shields are the de fact‚Ä¶"): making characters?
you can put an LTM on any item
they stack
you can have a Link with a separate tunic, gloves, and boots if you're willing to set up all the combinations
(heck that's how Bunny Link works)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/17/2022 03:20

you can even have separate characters each able to buy/use shields using non-shield items. Do you need me to tell you how?

=== @ NightmareJames 03/17/2022 07:02

Fair

=== @ P-Tux7 03/17/2022 07:10

Yeah you're really crippling yourself if you tie character appearance to shields
Because that means you cannot find shields, buy shields, or use Like Likes
I'll write up a quick tutorial for multi-LTM stacking tomorrow

=== @ NightmareJames 03/17/2022 07:20

I don't think many people would mind not having Shield Eater Like-Likes (one of the most hated enemies)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:20

Sorry haven't got on my computer the whole day

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:21

So here's how you do it
In this example we have three character states (Link, Zelda, James) and four shield states (Shieldless, Wooden Shield, Magic Shield, Hylian Shield)
Shieldless Link is the initial state, so we only have to make two character items (any item that you permanently own, basically) and three shield items (as you already know from ZC)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:24

For convenience, you want it so that each pose is X amount of pages away. A tile page in ZQ is 260 tiles, so entering a Link Tile Modifier of 260 makes him use tiles 1 page down after you get that item, like a shield.

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:29

So what does this mean? Because each player needs four pages for their four shield states, you have to set up the costume items and shield items in such a way:
-There is no Link item - he's default
-Zelda Costume: 1040 (260 * 4)
-James Costume: 2080 (260 * 8)
-There is no No Shield item - it's default
-Small Shield: 260 (260 * 1)
-Magic Shield: 520 (260 * 2)
-Hylian Shield: 780 (260 *3)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:33

So the pages are set up in this way, then (They can be ANYWHERE in the quest. LTMs just add on to WHATEVER current tile Link has that you set where it is in the player animation editor):
Shieldless Link (0)
Small Shield Link (260)
Magic Shield Link (520)
Hylian Shield Link (780)
Shieldless Zelda (1040)
Small Shield Zelda (1300)
Magic Shield Zelda (1560)
Hylian Shield Zelda (1820)
Shieldless James (2080)
Small Shield James (2340)
Magic Shield James (2600)
Hylian Shield James (2860)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:34

Those tiles are the amount that the LTM is set to when you have that combination of costume-items and shield items. So let's check the Zelda costume item LTM (1040), then add the Magic Shield LTM (520)... and we get 1560 as the total amount of tiles it's skipping ahead from the initial Link tile, tile 0.
(I'm speaking of "tile 0" relatively - as again, you can set it to be anywhere, and 1560 just means 1560 tiles ahead of whatever you set as Link's tiles in the Player Animation Editor. Notice how the default quest has his tiles on page 70-something and they work perfectly)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 03:37

Now, all you'd do to switch characters is use SCCs or scripts that remove the Zelda or James costume items. Storing their shield status would be trickier, but it can be done by setting three sets of shield variables (LinkShield, ZeldaShield, and JamesShield) all to 0 at the beginning of the quest, storing/setting their current level of Shield item to that variable when swapping, and when you swap, it loads the value of whichever other character and sets your shield level to the value of that variable.
Though if you're okay with them sharing shields, that doesn't have to happen

=== @ NightmareJames 03/18/2022 06:46

Hold up, I might make a whole new thread to discuss mechanics

=== @ NightmareJames 03/18/2022 17:21

Let me know

=== @ NightmareJames 03/18/2022 17:48

We'll discuss this more in #deleted-channel as per Emily's request.  I have a lot of questions on what your wrote P-Tux, but I need to lock this before it derails the purpose.
