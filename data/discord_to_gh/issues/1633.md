Would be cool if there was an option to specify the speed of slow walk combos, or alternatively a new combo type that does that. I see the benefits of both having the speed change be multiplicative versus a specific value, so it may be worth having both be an option. This would also allow for "fast-walk" combos, which might have utility in puzzles or combat.

This is in that layered combo test .txt file I whipped up, should I make all the requests in there separate feature-requests too, @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)?

What are you referrin to out of curiosity? I'm not familiar with the doc

=== @ vlamart 05/22/2022 17:48

I just did a little test to see what combo types work on the first 3 layers and ffcs, that doc is the results, and includes some feature requests at the end, mostly QOL stuff

I'll probably add `Custom Slow` flag for new behavior
and an `Additive` and `Percent Multiplier` value
....movement shit is not a fun time though, so will need the energy to do that shit

i agree with this suggestion
