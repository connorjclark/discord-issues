I don't know if I did something or is someone experience the same thing.  There is no heart cursor, can't select quest to play or register a new name but somehow can flip through pages.

what version
if you move your saves and config files to a new installation, you still see this?

The latest nightly like always.

I can't repro with that cfg file. If you see this again after a fresh install, let us know.

I was able to get around that bug by launching ZC from ZQuest Launcher.
