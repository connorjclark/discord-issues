wtf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 00:31

....ah, yeah
ok
not an error in the program, an error in the quest file
that's correctly showing the `Bow 2 (Long)` item... which for some reason has glitchy graphics set.

Because it didn't exist when the quest was created but this was also before item editor, so it auto generated the item with default tiles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 00:53

Except every item except the bow 2 has tile 0
It's only bow 2 that's different
