`npc->BFlags[]` is not documented in `ZScript_Additions.txt` nor are any constants defined in `std_constants.zh`

What constants would there be to define?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/24/2022 03:29

Well, the global ones thatexist for every enemy, though that will be gone with the new enemy editor

=== @ mitchfork 12/24/2022 14:24

Yeah I would expect that these (for "Other" enemies) would be defined

but don't know the plans for enemy editor rework so feel free to not do this as appropriate

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/24/2022 14:26

New enemy editor will have those just be global flags; behavior flags will be specifically *only* for things that can change between enemies
So I *could* make constants for them if they'd be helpful, but it might be better to just make constants for the new way of doing it and encourage using that instead

=== @ mitchfork 12/24/2022 14:27

yeah if they'll be immediately deprecated I agree

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/24/2022 14:28

Same for the global attributes
Attributes 13 won't be dedicated to invisibility anymore; attributes will only be for things that change between enemies
(or blank entirely for other enemies)
