As seen in this quest
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&id=211
Screen 6:41
You are supposed to use Din's Fire on the "X" combo to trigger screen secrets. But since this combo has a Wand Fire flag, it doesn't trigger in 2.50+. However, I have tested in 2.10, and Din's Fire DOES trigger Wand Fire flags in that version. ZC also says in the help text for Flag 74 that it can be triggered by either Wand Fire or Din's Fire.
So, I guess Din's Fire will need to trigger the flag in 2.10 and below, not trigger it in 2.5-now quests, and for now it should be a Quest Rule. I think it makes sense as a Quest Rule since one can argue whether or not Din's Fire should count as a more powerful version of Wand Fire, like how Wand Fire can also trigger Red Candle flags.

Additional question @ P-Tux7 : Should Din's Fire trigger Red Candle flags? (Currently, it does, but only if the din's fire is level 2 or higher. Was this the old behavior?)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2023 18:03

let me check, for blue candle flags as well
also in 2.50

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2023 18:05

Currently Dins always triggers blue candle and dins fire flags, and at level 2+ triggers red candle flags
also currently book fire triggers blue, red, and wand fire flags (regardless of the book or wand level!)
candle fire obviously only triggers the blue/red candle flags respectively, as expected
I have accounted for:
In versions `< 2.50`, Din's Fire should trigger Wand Fire flags
(thus `>= 2.50` they do not)
Anything that deviates from the information I've just given, would be something I need to know. If everything behaves exactly like I described, that's nothing to report.

sorry that this is taking so long... 2.10 windows is borderline unusable on a modern computer

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2023 18:17

no problem, I'm doing fancy shit anyway

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2023 18:18

i'm certainly not!

(the darknut is there to test wand fire)
each tree is blue candle, red candle, book fire, din's fire
so yes, din's fire burns blue candle, red candle, and book/wand fire flags in 2.10 and less. flags 4, 73, 74, 75
and now to test how it should do so in 2.50.2

Din's Fire burns Blue Candle (4), Red Candle (73), and Din's Fire (75), but NOT Book Fire (74) in 2.50.2+

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2023 18:29

wait, really?
a Level 1 Din's Fire burns Red Candle flags?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2023 18:30

*checks quest* yup
(in both versions, 2.10 obviously doesn't have settable item levels but the point still stands)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2023 18:30

...check that in 2.53?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2023 18:30

uh... which build to download
https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876907016642232430/937828307070775406
?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2023 18:33

Identical Red Candle and Book Fire flag behaviour to 2.50.2 is in that nightly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2023 18:36

wonder when that changed then, because it isn't in current 2.55

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2023 18:37

i'd wager that it's when settable combo trigger items/levels were introduced

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2023 20:51

If you could find exactly what build that changed in, that would be great
I should be able to compat-load it to the build

Din's, the Book, and the Candle now all have these 3 flags
`Strong Fire` burns `Red Candle` flags (Level 2 candles *no longer* burn red candle flags- though level 2 candles in old quests will have the `Strong Fire` flag enabled via version loader)
`Magic Fire` burns `Wand Fire` flags
and `Godly Fire` burns `Din's Fire` flags
So you, yes, can now make a din's fire that does NOT burn din's fire flags!
or a level 10 candle that does not burn red candle flags
or a dins/book that does not burn red candle flags
or that does
in any combination you like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2023 21:12

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "If you could find exactly wha…"): ^ Don't want to bury this message in the rest of that, @ P-Tux7 when you have the time

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2023 21:16

sure thing
also hell yeah

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2023 21:22

might i suggest renaming flags 73-75 as such

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2023 21:27

=== @ P-Tux7 03/19/2023 22:08

okay so um
i want to find the first build that did not let you burn red candle flags with din's fire, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 00:10

ye

=== @ P-Tux7 03/30/2023 21:08

uh christ
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) this is happening even in 2.55 alpha 83 (din's fire not burning red candle flags)
are there any older builds?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/30/2023 21:11

just rechecked 2.50.2 and it definitely burns there, so not an issue with my test quest (made in 2.50.2)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/30/2023 21:13

AND the latest #deleted-channel , so it's not something screwed up in there
