when the final line is reached and tries to print, it will terminate the console
does not terminate if the console is manually resized prior
@ HeroOfFireZC
issue appears on Windows 11

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 10/18/2023 22:06

That sums it up.

=== @ tim 10/18/2023 22:06

can replicate back to at least a97

=== @ Moosh 10/18/2023 22:36

Here's a question, does it close the 2.50 console as well?

=== @ tim 10/18/2023 22:38

when was console even added

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 10/18/2023 22:41

It terminated in 2.53.1 Beta 55
Same thing, once it needs a scrollbar it terminates, but otherwise exists fine.

=== @ Moosh 10/18/2023 22:42

The current one was in 2.53. For a while there were two console windows, the ZScript one Zoria made and an older one that terminated the ZC process when closed
I imagine only the Zoria one should have the issue

=== @ tim 10/18/2023 22:43

its just weird that it works fine if you do something to the console

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 10/18/2023 22:43

Yes, that also still worked in 2.53.1

might be best to scrap it all and make a real cross-platform debug terminal
https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/cpp-terminal
currently what y'all are having trouble with is the bespoke terminal stuff no one understands, and that runs windows only. on other platforms we just use allegro's dumb text output window, which has no color.
so a rewrite is needed anyhow.

=== @ tim 10/18/2023 22:50

ideally yeah
in program terminal

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2023 22:51

the above just handles communication and color output, and even fancy stuff like text menus. it is still BYOT (bring your own terminal)
but it should still be useful in making a platform-independent debug terminal. Just gotta work out how to launch the terminal in each platform ourselves I guess

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2023 22:53

y'all mentioned cmd and PowerShell, but what about Windows Terminal? That's the modern terminal.

=== @ tim 10/18/2023 22:58

terminal loads ps/cmd in tabs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2023 23:02

uh, right. i forgot shell/terminal distinction
so this is already launching in new Terminal for you?
but also old barebones cmd.exe fails too?

=== @ tim 10/18/2023 23:06

w11 only loads it in the tabs

=== @ tim 10/18/2023 23:14

i have a workaround

=== @ tim 10/18/2023 23:15

and i dont like it

=== @ tim 10/18/2023 23:18

it invovles opening all terminals in focus mode üòî
