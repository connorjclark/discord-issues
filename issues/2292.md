The ability to have 'a toggle option' to give Wisemen in Wisemen cave rooms solidity and also, a toggle to choose whether their solid fires would harm the player or not by at least 1 heart if the player touches them.

This would finally end the long age, 'forgetting to make every wisemen room solid' so player does not walk over them all just like a floor or their fires even.  

Also lastly, once they are 'vanished' from a room, the solidity of the Wiseman and their fires are completely removed.
