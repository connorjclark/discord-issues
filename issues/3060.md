Setting this value causes an NPC to jump in top down, but not on sideview screens. I tested this in 2.50.2 as well, and the behavior is different (but still not desirable). In 2.50.2, a Walking Enemy will jump up in sideview if you set its Jump value while it's falling, but not while it's already on the ground. In the Feb 11 2.55 nightly, setting Jump while an enemy is falling will cause it to stop in midair until gravity subtracts enough to make Jump fall below 0 again, but no longer actually jumps. Still no effect on the ground. See map 3/dmap 1/screen 0x01 on the attached file. An FFC script sets Jump to 2 for all enemies on screen when Ex1 is pressed. The same results are observed for an NPC script, too.
