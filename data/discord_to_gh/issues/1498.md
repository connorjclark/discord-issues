Copying a tile, moving to a different tile, and pressing M will move the tile. Pressing U will undo it. Previously, this worked fine. Now, even if you press undo, any combos that pointed to that tile keep pointing to the new, undone tile location. Horridly inconvenient, given that the only time I use the move function is when trying to highlight tiles to make into combos with M and forgetting I still have tiles on the clipboard.

aye
this is how it's always worked
because undoing isn't smart
it literally just copies the old tile buffer

=== @ Russ 03/29/2022 02:40

... Are you positive?
I'm almost certain it didn't have this buggy behaviour before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2022 02:40

it always has
because
it literally just stores a copy of all the tile data
and it just restores that
it does not store any information about what you last did
so, since it has no idea that you 'moved' tiles, it can't very well undo the side-effects of that
this has been known about for quite a while
but, requires literally rewriting a new `undo` from scratch to fix

=== @ Russ 03/29/2022 02:43

Can we at least get a way to disable the move command if that's not going to happen, then?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2022 02:44

it is planned to happen

This bugged the shit out of me in 2.53
and still bugs the shit out of me now
so, uh, good luck Emily!
(I'd offer to do it but I have a to-do list and I'm already far behind)

This is now MOSTLY working
There is one slight edge-case that isn't going to be fixable without a hell of a lot larger of a rewrite
If you move a combo or tile, and that move *OVERWRITES* a combo/tile used by something else, then when you undo, it will revert everything that moved originally.... AND everything that you overwrite will be dragged with it.
i.e., it basically just does `move` in the reverse direction
but, with the standard undo behavior of restoring the combos/tiles that the move overwrote originally
just, anything USING those combos/tiles won't be anymore
...if you `Move` into empty/unused space, it should work *perfectly* to undo.

@ Russ feel free to try it out
(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìUndoing moved tiles doesn't update combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2022 20:39

The only way to get around the one edge case, would be to literally make gigantic arrays of every enemy/combo/item/etc in the game that uses a tile, and store a copy of their tiles; which, uh, is a lot of extra memory to be eating, and a lot of work to maintain. Probably worth doing at some point (which is why I'm marking this sick instead of complete), but, fuck if I'm touching that any time soon

Need to make it so Move is Ctrl + M
accidentally moving when you meant to make a combo is annoying

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2022 21:37

I'd change make, not move
Move/copy/paste are all basic operations, shouldn't require keys
Also, beware; some modifier keys already do stuff
I think alt and shift already do something when pasting/moving?

=== @ Russ 03/31/2022 21:38

I can't speak for everyone, but I use Make daily and have never once used Move
I'd make the less frequently used shortcut require the modifier

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2022 21:39

I have used make once and move dozens of times
So...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/31/2022 21:39

Mostly, accidentally doing a move is more annoying than accidentally doing a make, so move should require you to hold down a key (so if you forget to hold it or it doesn't register, it does a make), instead of the inverse

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2022 21:40

Eh, that's a fair point... though I can tell you right now it would annoy the crap out of me as a user
If you're going to do it, make a config to swap it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/31/2022 21:41

yeah sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2022 21:41

That way everyone can be happy

=== @ Russ 03/31/2022 21:41

I'm always on board for more configuration options

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/31/2022 21:42

you don't get them, filthy small mode user üò†

Paste and move make use of Alt and Shift already
Overlay uses Ctrl already
So beware overlapping those
(It looks like Alt hflips the paste, and Shift vflips it? )
Overlay uses all 3 actually
Alt and Shift are same as paste
And ctrl makes it not remove from the clipboard
