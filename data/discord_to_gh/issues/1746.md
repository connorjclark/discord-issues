Latest nightly

Script:

https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=341

I compiled the script again, which it did perfectly, and then saved the example quest file in the nightly. 

On first run, the first patroller seemingly caught Link fine, I got moved to another screen with the barrel on it. screen 00 to screen 10. 

Then I got caught again on the next screen to the right (screen 01) and ZC froze and the console went apeshit.

The allegro.log is huge but 99.999% of that is just the same like 8 lines repeated thousands of times

It isn't QUITE the same, it's different commands
but it boils down to the same problem
the `this->` pointer is broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 04:19

meaning it is not being initialized properly

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:21

I know scripts themselves aren't something to "bug report" on, but my reasoning is to bring attention to changes to ZScript itself, in-engine.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 04:21

I would assume ALL npc scripts would be broken
How was the enemy spawned?

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:23

Oh uh, this isn't a script I wrote or anything. I just asked randomly for recommendations of scripts to test in the latest nightly. This script is yours üòù not that I'm assuming you'll know everything exactly about a script you wrote 2-3 years ago.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 04:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "How was the enemy spawned?"): ^
Did you just place the enemy on the screen normally?
Or use another script?
Or what?
(I didn't actually grab the quest file yet)

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:24

Oh uh, it was the test quest that came with the script. Let me check the setup more
It's an in-engine Other type enemy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 04:25

oh, it was my test quest
that is my script btw

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:26

it is, I should have been clearer on that, my bad
yeah its your wind waker stealth script and I just tested your test quest in a nightly to see what the console/allegro.log spit out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 04:27

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) I don't see any obvious changes related to initializing npc scripts..... something is weird here, and IDK what

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:27

I can't actually debug scripts themselves, but I figure this is probably better than just saying its broken like others have been doing recently.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 04:27

@ Majora can you try to find the last build that this worked in?

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:28

yeah i'll try a few builds
or well enough to conclude something.

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:40

Tried in June 20th build, the script works way better. Patrollers/Darknuts actually move to Link and Link is warped as soon as the Darknut sprite collides with Link. The barrel doesn't work.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/997712643932565504/997724644113137715/allegro.log?ex=65ebe87b&is=65d9737b&hm=6349fdd16838801d520f95b18f7efda93d43088eccb0c4d8a978624e7ad41206&
`FFC script 1 (hidableBarrel): Script attempted to change own object's script! This has been ignored.`

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:47

Tried jumping back to alpha 106, and EmilyMisc.zh is missing. I don't know if the one on pureZC will have issues and the one included with the builds is probably too new to work. 

Gonna try the PureZC one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 04:49

oh, lol, I forgot I even included that
the one on the db should be basically identical
and also nothing in that file has anything to do with the issue
the issue occurs before it touches anything from that file
so it should work fine

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:50

oh okay, gotcha

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 04:57

Alpha 106, April 10th build, same behavior as June 20th build. Everything works but the barrel is broken with that same "This has been ignored" message

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/997712643932565504/997728781211013211/allegro.log?ex=65ebec56&is=65d97756&hm=95a14423777788a45a187917618c12a014da1c27b87dad7956c6b8dc509df9c2&

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 04:59

Is the barrel actually broken?
that message means nothing
like, that's an error in the script
and will be there in any version
and it worked regardless of that when I released the script

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 05:01

Oh, well nothing happens to Link when I hit A by the barrel combo. it disappears, but nothing happens to link or appears in inventory.

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 05:04

Shit, fuck, pain, kill me. the barrel works.
Nevermind about alpha 106. if I stand still while in the vision cone of a patroller, nothing happens. barrel works.

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 05:31

Somewhere between june 25th and july 5th

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 05:39

July 1st/2nd, broken. 
June 28th, works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 05:46

oh wait
I see what's happening here sort of
So the enemy is just going offscreen and killing itself
....why the fuck is it going offscreen
I will tell you that it isn't that ZC is somehow freezing
the script is freezing you until the enemy reaches your position
....it just, is walking AWAY from you instead of TOWARDS you for some godforsaken reason

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 05:52

.....
OH
FOR FUCKS
I BROKE A THING
WTF WAS I THINKING DUMBASS
....mostly can be considered a typo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 05:53

I have now found out what happens when you have an internal function that has it's name declared, but no code to go inside it
It most certainly *still compiles completely fine* and just acts as though it returns the wrong value
and when you mess with functions that have to do with angles, it might just break scripts that use angular movement....
thank you for narrowing down the versions there @ Majora , or that would have taken me like a week or two to figure out

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 05:55

yuh! o7
I'm just glad it's a simple fix

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 05:56

yeah uh
the internal `RadtoDeg` and `DegtoRad` just had no code
so calling them was super fucked
Deedee had named them `EngineRadtoDeg` and `EngineDegtoRad`, which kinda goes against all the other naming conventions we've used
and when I fixed it
I missed a block of code ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

=== @ Majora 07/16/2022 05:59

d'oh, gotta make sure to let others know when conventions are messed with

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/16/2022 06:02
