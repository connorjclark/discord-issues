Should be able to trim some memory usage off of `struct mapscr`, and get it back in the form of new things
for instance, adding a set of 32 lock bits for use with multiple lockblocks?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2021 22:14

To look into trimming:
-word viewX
-word viewX
-byte scrWidth
-byte scrHeight
-word script_entry
-word script_occupancy
-word script_exit
-byte old_cpage
-int32_t npcstrings[10]

To look into using:
-int16_t new_items[10]
-int16_t new_item_x[10] (can be byte?)
-int16_t new_item_y[10] (can be byte?)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2021 22:15

should be able to trim 53 bytes from removing those, plus another 32 from lowering the new_item_x/y arrays to byte
85 free bytes for mapscr is huge
