FFC's that have a dropset (I tested using `Bush->Next (Continuous)` and `Slash->Next (Item)`, may be present for more) will not spawn according to their dropset, but instead spawn some hardcoded chance of either 1 rupee or a heart pickup
This applies even to the default dropset.  I.e., bushes with no options set will normally generate dropset 12.  FFC bushes will instead do this heart/rupee drop that doesn't seem to line up with any actual dropset

This is a fairly old bug and is present in 2.53.1

2 bugs!
Firstly, ffcs were checking the attributes of the combo at that position instead of the FFC's combo
so if you set a dropset, it wasn't working!
This should just be fixed outright, that's a 2.55 bug.
Secondly, the hardcoded weird drops that did exist in 2.53. I compat-ruled those.
Should all be fixed.
