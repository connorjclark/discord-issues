like, an option for how link dies, or making link die in different ways depending on how he is killed?

I mean, there is an `onDeath` script slot just for this purpose? Make a header with it?

=== @ Alucard648 04/17/2023 07:24

Something like this, so scripters can understand, how onDeath script slot works.

=== @ P-Tux7 04/17/2023 14:43

Well, isn't that a script you can make yourself?

=== @ Alucard648 04/17/2023 15:07

Yes. A proper API for scripts like this is welcome, as scripting in 2.55+ is much more complex, than in previous versions.
