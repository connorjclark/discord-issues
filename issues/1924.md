The windows scaling issues still persist, even when I'm using the latest nightly.
ZC and ZQ do not respect Windows' scaling settings.

old report: #1717

I cannot post in there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2022 02:41

aye, it's not meant for posting
it's meant for reading
the old bug report/feature request channels are perma-locked so that all reports go through the new forum channels

I'm working on this now, I think we solved one half of the issue but the other half is proving to be interesting
(read: I'm in pain send help)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2022 10:55

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
so, basically, dpi awareness is a thing
and Allegro 5 decided `Hey, let's turn off OS scaling because having that on by default is stupid!`
so, we added some lines to the cmakle
and now the program is dpi unaware, thus resizes
....except for one thing
Connor's resizing code, resizes to `resx,resy` on launching zelda.exe
but
that happens after the window is created
so overrides the scaling
so, we need to get the scale percentage so we can apply it ourselves at that step
and
that's proving to be a mess of dll files and shit that we are too tired and headachy to really figure out

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/06/2022 11:05

@ Orithan

=== @ Orithan 10/06/2022 11:05

Yes?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/06/2022 11:05

Could you try this and see if this fixed the blurriness?

You'll still need to resize the window manually; if you're okay with doing a bit of math you can do it via etc->video mode
But let me know if the larger windows don't look blurry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2022 11:07

basically what's happening right now is
the window is upscaling properly
but then it's being resized down by connor's code
and fixing that last bit is like 50x worse than the first bit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/06/2022 11:08

If you change the scaling *while* ZC is open, it should also resize it automatically

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2022 11:08

^ aye, it detects the changes while open

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/06/2022 11:08

The problem is that it doesn't open with the correct scaling when first opening

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2022 11:08

realistically it *does* open with the correct scaling, it just immediately resets the window size right after that
so you never see it at the correct scaling

=== @ Orithan 10/06/2022 11:24

Another problem I have is, when opening it in x2 size the bottom of the window cannot be clicked on, instead clicking it clicks off the window
This was a problem with 107 btw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2022 11:25

specifically using the scale in zq settings?
or also if you drag to resize it?
(either way, probably worth a *separate* bug report for connor to take a look at)

=== @ Orithan 10/06/2022 11:54

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "specifically using the scale…"): Using the scale in ZQ settings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2022 11:59

@ Russ ^ see above
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ""): ^

=== @ Russ 10/06/2022 12:00

I can give it a shot, though I'm on a new computer with a smaller monitor now so will be hard to test as effectively

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2022 12:01

you two were the only ones I saw complaining about this issue
and orithan seems to be good
so, hopefully it works satisfactorily for you
....and if it doesn't, I feel like the answer is very much "too bad there's nothing more we can do", because it now is interfacing with windows shit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/06/2022 16:31

I'll look into proper resolution and scaling later this week. In the meantime, If y'all do anything else here make sure it's behind a windows check otherwise this will break Mac

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/07/2022 02:42

ye
My current thoughts is that allegro 4 did some sort of antialiasing when drawing with larger scales

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2022 02:44

It likely did nothing for dpi but a5 uses windows apis that enables dpi by default.
Pretty sure monitors didn't have rich displays until well after a4
Windows would have done all the scaling I think
But this stuff is really arcane so I'm just guessing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2022 03:14

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I'll look into proper resolut…"): aye, made sure that exactly that was done

Sorry to bump this post back from the dead, but I can confirm, on a new computer, on a newer version of Windows 10, that this issue is still occurring.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/11/2022 01:13

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) with your recent changes re: window, windows dpr, etc; zquest seems to ignore the `-scale` flag

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/11/2022 01:14

Should that override `window_width` and height if present (setting them to `zq_screen_w*scale`)?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 02:04

I calculated window_width and window_height based on scale
does scale do anything besides setting the size?
if not, I think it can be deprecated

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2022 23:03

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "I calculated window_width and…"): so, should this be all fixed now?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 23:06

Yeah
I'd like Russ and Orithan to test it though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2022 23:06

@ Russ @ Orithan
...err, just gonna confirm, @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) , was this in the latest nightly or do we need to post a new one?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 23:07

we need to post a new one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2022 23:08

ahk I'll post one now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 23:08

that new one should also have the palette issue on the save screen fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2022 23:08

err
deedee, your latest pushes fail compile tests

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 23:08

wait what?

fix that and then launch a nightly

how to I launch a nightly again?

dm'd you

#deleted-channel when y'all have a minute to test @ Russ @ Orithan

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:17

It works in ZC, but it gives me a black border whenever I resize in ZQ.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:18

....yeah, makes sense. Connor's working on stuff.
Aside from the black border, is it the correct size?
(that's a separate issue)

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:24

It stays at x1 resolution with the black border
Same applies to ZCL

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:25

but like
is the whole window the appropriate scaled size

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:25

No
It just stays at x1 resolution while there is a big black box surrounding it
If I go smaller it resizes appropriately

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:27

set `scaling_force_integer` in the .cfg to `0`
(replying to @ Orithan "It just stays at x1 resolutio…"): but like
*including the size of the black box*

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:28

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:28

when I say "the window", that means *everything*
if that, including the black area, is the correct scale
then this is fixed

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:28

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:28

as I said, the black bars are a separate issue

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:28

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "set `scaling_force_integer` i…"): It's nowhere in the cfg

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:28

add it then
it frankly should add itself when you run the program.....
ah
deedee added a checkbox for it in the launcher
`Force Integer Values for Scale`
uncheck
....the problem this then has is blurriness
which is what that was meant to fix
by forcing it to an integer scale
the blurriness was caused by linear interpolation
which was meant to fix text distortion when scaling
which is just a result of how scaling works
so, it's a `fixing one problem causes another`, repeated several times
connor is working on literally rewriting the entire way the gui is drawn to fix this

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:31

Checking it in the launcher causes the black boxes in ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:31

aye, that it would
I said *uncheck*
note that there's one on the ZC tab and the ZQ tab which are separate

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:34

Okay it works
No such option seems to exist for ZCLauncher

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:37

yeah....
I don't know why
if you've run zclauncher
it should add the `scaling_force_integer` to `zcl.cfg`
you can set that to 0

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:41

Nope
Doesn't get added

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:42

?????
what the fuck?

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:42

Oh zcl.cfg

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:42

oh
yes
`zcl.cfg`

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:42

I thought it was ag.cfg

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:42

the launcher configs would be in the launcher config file
I have no clue if anything uses ag.cfg at all anymore
want to say 'no'

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:44

Set it to 0 there, no dice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:46

???

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:51

I am very confused
....oh
wait
that
****WHAT***
that didn't fix it either
.....I am confused
I literally commented out the code that handles this
and it didn't fix it

ahk take this
I am very very confused but this worked
err wait
but that has a checkbox that does nothing now
one sec

*there*, for real this time.

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:57

It works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:57

I just nuked it from orbit

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:57

Windows Defender threw up a false positive for me here.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:57

it refused completely to read the config properly
and I could not figure out why
so I commented it all out
THAT failed
so I uncommented it but forced it false
and that finally worked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 10:00

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "then this is fixed"): Anyway, as per this much higher up bit of discussion, this bug is fixed, so closing the report.

I just put handling this behind a config
because we have now had complaints either way it works, so, now you can pick if you want it to care or not.
