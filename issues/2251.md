When you're in Combo Flag placement mode, ZQuest doesn't update the minimap when you switch screens or maps. Well, it does, but it seems to retain the original map and draws it over the current minimap. This is what happens if you open Combo Flags on Map 2 of the first quest and then try and switch to Map 3.

yeah, I noticed.
I can't see why though at all
like, I spent like 2-3 hours debugging it
and... it's running the draws?
they just... aren't appearing?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/22/2023 17:34

oh um hold on
so it's easier to see in this custom quest where each dungeon is its own map

so it *is* sort of drawing the new map when switched to, it's just drawing it all-black

...what

=== @ P-Tux7 03/22/2023 17:36

(the grey part is the first map - the one i opened Combo Flags on, the black part is the new map that I switched to with the period key)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/22/2023 17:36

that's weird
I more focused my debugging on why the cursor isn't animating

=== @ P-Tux7 03/22/2023 17:38

it seems like it just draws one frame of minimap at the start of combo flag placement mode and constantly overlays it on top of the "true" minimap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/22/2023 17:39

yeah, that's weird
...it's like it's failing to update the A5 layer, is what it's doing
that's exactly what it is

=== @ P-Tux7 03/22/2023 17:39

i'd also like to note that for whatever reason it's not gotten to the step in the minimap draw where it loads the current palette, as you can see by the black screens above (though luckily it DOES load the palette for the main screen)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/22/2023 17:40

no, no, it's not black
and it's not palette loading
the color part is on the A5 layer
the black part is just the blank background on the A4 layer
it's literally just failing to do the A5 draws
and I see exactly why, bleh
thank you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/22/2023 17:43

(Notably, there *is no palette loading at all* involved in the minimap)
(it loads the color *as part of the draw*)
