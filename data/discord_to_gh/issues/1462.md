This is a very minor change.  In the very latest build (I got it March/11/22.) if you enter the cheat menu in ZC Player, type a cheat code, and then press enter, instead of activating the cheat level, it just closes the cheat menu without activating the cheat as if the "Cancel" button was highlighted.

Naturally, this isn't the desired behavior of hitting enter after typing in the cheat code. 😛

It doesn't press `Cancel`, it presses `OK`
which is the function of the enter button in most dialogs

...but easy enough to change.
