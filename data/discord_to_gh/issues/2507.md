I have my scripted map to respond to the map or menu button to close the map and it worked until the July 5th build where hitting the map button to close is fine, but the menu button opens the menu after the map closes. A temp fix is to have a buffer as it seems setting the input press to false is not disabling it.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:09

can you give me a quest test for this please?

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 03:14

sure

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:15

https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1088612904791711834 was last time input code was changed
but that didnt land in the july 5th nightly, it landed Jun 15
What script type is this?
uuuh prob OnMap i guess

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 03:17

hu, I am not seeing the issue anymore. Not on tonight's build
wait a moment
I am, I forgot I had a bandaid fix

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:18

I think I see some other issue with map scripts which could be making this a unpredictable bug

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 03:18

Making a new quest with it I do not have the issue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:19

Accidentally using the script engine data for dmaps instead of a separate one for map scripts. which makes pretty much anything happen

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 03:19

and yes, an OnMap script
hu, makes sense that could have unpredictable behavior

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:19

wait no, I misread my own code.
one sec

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 03:21

Go to map 32 screen 0x46, grab the map to see the bug
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1127417362413518869/1127439269426888824/ToNDemo4.qst?ex=65ed2724&is=65dab224&hm=e39c1681ea3f726329ffa583dc15143e22357ea81f22b31ee27cc138a1bb4659&
in case you need to

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:23

this is pretty funny lol. Some time ago there was a bug where the map could not be _closed_
now it can't be opened

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 03:23

that is a current bug?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:25

Oh I misread the bug report. ignore that then.
thanks

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:28

is this the right screen?

Oh, I need a dmap..
oops

map 32, dmap 18, my bad

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:45

did a bisect...

```sh
python3 scripts/bisect_builds.py --good nightly-2023-06-12 --bad nightly-2023-07-08 --token $GH_PAT -c '%zc -test C:\\Users\cjamc\Downloads\ToNDemo4.qst 18 70'
```

and yup it was the recent input change https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/a773ac9baf5dcbb88f3fb737b27b0435bbcada47

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:49

what happens if you use ~~Link->InputMap~~ Link->InputStart

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 03:54

what lines would that replace?
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1127417362413518869/1127447665995677757/image.png?ex=65ed2ef6&is=65dab9f6&hm=f65f8ea0d0f37d2d5090685ac0c930f1b5366bcef1e19f9b994cd7c920a63ddd&)
isnt technically the map button spacebar?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 03:58

Link->InputStart = false; instead of setting Press/Button to false

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 04:00

same behavior

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 04:33

so currently the fix I have is simply undoing what was done to fix a bug in the Banana quest
https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1088612904791711834/1117179023638925372

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 04:36

so that bug likely requires a different fix eh?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 05:00

we probably need a compat rule here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 05:06

btw- w/ the fix you'll only need to set Button to false, not Press

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 05:18

Since this was initially introduce Dec 4 via https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/5b9edea27bf8ad41bbef95297697d462653a7f4c , I will set the compat rule to enable for compat rule version 35 (which was bumped also on Dec 4). Pretty sure it's likely a quest made since Dec relied on the input behavior just like @ Deathrider did

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 05:19

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ^ does that make sense?

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 05:21

odd, I would have been relying on this since long before that. Good the bug is found though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/09/2023 05:22

yeah, that makes sense

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 05:25

man this was rough to re-understand for the third time
(replying to @ Deathrider "odd, I would have been relyin…"): It could have regressed a bit earlier. Lots of stuff changed with input stuff to get replays to work :/
If we find other quests busted like yours was, we'll move the comapt rule back to earlier versions too
I'm sure this isn't the last we've seen of input shennanigans.
Exposing the raw states to scripts was a mistake 😦

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 06:02

this is the compat qr...

```
"Broken Input Down State For Scripts", qr_BROKEN_INPUT_DOWN_STATE

If enabled, setting button inputs to false (ex: `Input->Button[CB_A] = false`) will have no effect on button presses. If disabled, button presses are eaten.
```

So does this behavior sound good? @ Moosh @ Russ  fyi...

=== @ Moosh 07/09/2023 06:06

I have never used Input->Button[] myself. But it looks correct to me? Does this have the same effect on the old InputX methods?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 06:06

(replying to @ Moosh "I have never used Input->Butt…"): yup
they are different ZASM commands but they do the same thing.

=== @ Moosh 07/09/2023 06:07

To be clear, disabled here is the "fixed" state, right?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 06:07

(replying to deleted comment): @ Deathrider this fixes your bug, and it keeps Bananas working still. Could you spend some time with it and see if it doesn't toally break other stuff?
(replying to @ Moosh "To be clear, disabled here is…"): Yes, thats the compat rule being OFF

=== @ Moosh 07/09/2023 06:08

Alright cool. That all makes sense

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 09:12

fixed in upcoming nightly

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 15:00

So what was the fix?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 18:03

Using the actual state of the keys for button press internal logic, not what a script happened to set. And putting that behind a QR.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 18:45

You'll need to enable the new compat QR rule. Let me know if it works for you.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 18:59

(nightly building right now)

=== @ Moosh 07/09/2023 21:47

Oh! So setting Press also does nothing now? In addition to Input suppressing Press?
or did it always do nothing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 21:53

First to make sure we are on the same page: the zscript Press state is _only used by scripts_

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 21:54

every frame it is set based on the true hardware states of the keys
so any writes to it (or Hold) only have impact for reads from scripts  _for the duration of that frame_

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 21:57

I don't think any of this behavior changes with this QR

=== @ Moosh 07/09/2023 22:04

ah right

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 00:36

Marking as fixed.
