Would it be possible to get some sort of screenshot button or feature that allows you to copy the current screen you're working on to your clipboard? Would make sharing progress more convenient without clogging up your screenshots folder for WIP stuff.
I originally intended this for the editor but I suppose it might be also useful to have in the player.

you mean like this that I added.... like 3-4 years ago IIRC?

He's asking for it to go the clipboard, not to the snapshots folder

oh, err
....I have no idea if that's at all possible
the only clipboard function I know takes a string of text
so

....a quick google search shows allegro forums saying "yeah have fun with that, find another library or implement it yourself"
