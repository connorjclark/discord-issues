See my screenshots for reference. The combo brush height doesn't work properly

uhhhhh
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) did you touch anything related to this?
Because I don't think I did
OH
Wait
@ Rebonite I don't think this is a bug
Open the combo page

Press `Space`

and it re-organizes the combos to go across the top, instead of in columns
The brush respects how *this* is displaying

Huh, so it does
You can press space at any time to swap between the two modes
so if it does that, you should hit space and try again cause you're in the wrong mode
a bit confusing and should probably have an indicator that you're in a different mode

=== @ Twilight Knight 02/26/2022 17:56

Yup, you are right. Pressing space fixed it and I indeed notice it coheres with the combo page

Thank you!
