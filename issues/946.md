PlayOGG and GetPos/SetPos are bugged currently. I think GetPos was the issue, but one of the two just outright crashes
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) could you possibly give this a glance to see if there's anything obviously wrong? If not, I might have to give this a more in depth look, cause it worked at some point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2021 21:20

I just traced GetPos and found no issues down to the call to `alogg_get_pos_msecs_ogg`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/25/2021 21:21

Does GetPos crash when used with PlayOgg?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2021 21:21

that function is being called, and passed a non-null `ALOGG_OGG` object
unsure
you said you thought it was the issue so I traced it
don't have a test quest or test files

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2021 21:25

SetPos seems identically set up

=== @ Ether 08/25/2021 21:26

Is it possible that the OGG glitch I was experiencing in 253.1 is related to this? It's Yuurand, soooooooo I don't know how helpful it would be compared to something more isolated for this, but.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2021 21:26

no
this is a new 2.55 feature

=== @ Ether 08/25/2021 21:26

Got it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2021 21:26

for zscript managing oggs

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "don't have a test quest or te‚Ä¶"): I went to dig up a test quest but my organization is bad and I think onedrive ate it\
*sigh*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2021 21:32

fun
I don't see anything immediately wrong
so, probably gonna take digging

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/25/2021 21:32

lovely.
Gonna be pissed if it ends up being a zoriaism

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/12/2021 00:50

SetPos is the issue
but I don't know what the hell it even is
that's why using obscure libraries is bad v.v
