Exactly as it says on the tin. Open the FFC menu, edit an FFC, and set its combo. When you close out of the FFC editor, the currently selected cset will change to whatever the last FFC edited's cset is.
With 2.55 alpha 105, to clarify
I certainly don't recall this behaviour occurring with alpha 104
