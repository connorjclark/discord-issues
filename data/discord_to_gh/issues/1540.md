Emily, please post the fix here and mark it sick.  It was working, but I need to change it for the entire build of New Quest  and verify just to make sure though

the heck is that sword

New Quest had some weird swords, but that is the Lv. 4 Sword from Lv. 11

Why did you even make a report if that fixed it

=== @ NightmareJames 04/16/2022 02:50

Documentation purposes and I wasn't done going through it, but I am now and it is indeed fixed
