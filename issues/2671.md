1. Open Autocombo Editor
2. Add a combo to any slot.
3. Right click on added combo to erase it.

Result: the current CSet is automatically set to 0 for all drawing modes. I don`t think it is intentional.
(meta) thread name was changed: Erasing combo in autocombo editor sets current CSet to 0

okay tbh, did not realize you could right click combo panes to erase. I always do it with alt + click while selecting combo 0. Should be an easy enough fix
