Pretty straightforward. Calling Game->LoadMapData() on a screen in the bottom row (0x80+) produces an error

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:44

Dunno if there's some internal reason for this. Figured it might be a one line fix, otherwise no big deal
Just discovered it because I like to use that bottom row of screens for special layers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:50

This is intentional

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:50

Oh?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:51

the bottom screens *are* special, and literally don't have all the data that mapdata normally can access
so a number of things would be invalid/glitchy

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:51

Oh
Well hmm
I'ma have to test something then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:51

and, uh
in general, you should not use those screens
for anything other than their exact intended purpose

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:51

Because I think I accessed them another way
Wait nope, it checks out, it was a temp layer ü§¶
How exactly are they different structurally though out of curiousity?
Wouldn't it take _more_ effort to code them to not have all the properties of a screen?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:52

frankly I don't know entirely, that's part of the ZC janky-as-fuck shit I try to avoid touching at all costs

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:53

Fair. Maybe add this as a note in the docs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:53

Also, I just checked the code

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:53

Because it sure tripped me up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:53

`0x80`/`0x81` are accessible

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:53

oh
well then
false assumption on my part I suppose

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:53

`else if ( _scr < 0 || _scr > 129 ) //0x00 to 0x81 -Z`
so, @ DeletedUser , what exactly is the reason for this limitation?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:55

(replying to @ Moosh "Wait nope, it checks out, it‚Ä¶"): aye, temp layers are fun. Basically, there are 14 global variables that are screen objects
and it copies from the perm screen data into the global temp vars
(14 because 7 (layers 0-6) for both the current screen, and for the 'other' screen during scrolling)

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:56

Oh yeah, I believe I confirmed earlier that temp screens do not exist if the layer isn't assigned on the screen
Cause I was having difficulty debugging something and enabling the layer fixed that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 16:57

what happens if you access the layer?

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:57

Error I believe. Lemme double check

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 16:59

Oh...it's letting me read it at least. Hmm, what is up with this

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 17:00

Ah yes, it was working because I forgot to unassign the layer. Can tell I'm tired üòõ

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2021 17:03

```        mapdata l6 = Game->LoadTempScreen(6);
        Trace(l6->ComboD[0]);```
So this works. It recognizes there's nothing there and traces 0
```            l6->ComboD[i] = Rand(100);
            l6->ComboC[i] = 0;```
This does not work. It does not successfully garble the screen
Make of that what you will
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 17:07

????
so, `l6->ComboD[i] = 10; Trace(lb->ComboD[i]);` traces `0`?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:20

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so, @ DeletedUser ,‚Ä¶"): those are prohibitions

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:21

else if ( _scr < 0 || _scr > 129 ) //0x00 to 0x81 -Z
    {
        Z_scripterrlog("Invalid Screen ID passed to Game->LoadMapData: %d\n", _scr);
        ri->mapsref = LONG_MAX;
        return LONG_MAX;
    }

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:22

Can fix later with an inst rule

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 21:23

I was asking *why* it was limited

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:24

i wasn't sold that the 0x82 screens would be safe to modify
probably should be > 0x82

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:26

*(>130)
I missed one valid screen
0x82 is afaik never normally used
80 is guy room 81 is passageway
82 was reserved for future similar room types bu never implemented in any way

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2021 21:30

up to 0x87 are editable

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:37

aye  but reserved for sys expansion

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:39

so an instr rule that changes the cap rom 129 to whatever you feel *is safe considering that *would allow it if you  want

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:40

I did not want to encourage using these for random stuff
as that could limit actually adding special purposes to them

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/10/2021 21:44

so, I intentionally limited it to screens that are at present used by engine mechanics to prevent those possible problems

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 02:41

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so, `l6->ComboD[i] = 10; Trac‚Ä¶"): @ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 02:42

Ah, lemme check

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 02:45

Okay so it traces whatever I set it to. So I guess the problem is less that the tempscreens don't exist and more they don't draw when the layer is unassigned

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 02:47

*OH*
`->Valid`
probably involved

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 02:51

I assume Valid is read only

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 02:52

pretty sure, aye
give me a moment

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 02:54

@ Moosh see how this works

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/896799972845056040/896953796628996126/buildpack.zip?ex=65e537d1&is=65d2c2d1&hm=873683f0b2c31d98e4ccb1cf54ff9b946e8c1b7cf25c8ed4eb216581dea1b373&

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 02:56

What's it change?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 02:56

I made the screen combo modify postroutine set the valid bit
so `l6->ComboD[i] = n;` should set the valid bit true

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 02:57

Ah
Will that make setting ComboD run slower?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 02:58

Technically, yes
slower by some fraction of a microsecond
so, noticably, not likely

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:00

so, does it draw the layer now?

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 03:01

Doesn't appear to, no

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 03:02

```ffc script NewLayer{
    void run(){
        mapdata l6 = Game->LoadTempScreen(6);
        for(int i=0; i<176; ++i){
            l6->ComboD[i]=Rand(100);
        }
    }
}```
Here's all I'm doing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:03

ah crap
it's checking directly against `->layermap[]`
give me a minute

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:08

@ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 03:10

Yup that did it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:11

changed the `->layermap[type]!=0` checks to `->valid` checks
so now once the valid bit gets set, it knows to draw the layer
viola, layer effects without needing to use up a screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:13

(replying to @ Moosh "Pretty straightforward. Calli‚Ä¶"): As for this original report, I'm going to call that `not a bug`. Frankly you probably shouldn't be using those screens for anything.

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2021 03:13

sure. I do think it should be noted in ZScript_Additions.txt though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 03:14

aye, noted
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîíLoadMapData() thinks the bottom row of screens are invalid
