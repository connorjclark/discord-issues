Version: Nightly 12-21-2022
Both the liftable combos in this test quest are not dropping the room's Special Item when lifted or broken.
Z1 tree: Normal liftable combo, has the Armos->Special Item flag on it
Stripey tree: Liftable combo with the flag "Drops Special Item" checked
The room type is Special Item and the Room Special Item is set to the L1/Blue Amulet.

I'm actually not sure if it's supposed to drop the Special Item when LIFTED (i.e. the item is "beneath" the combo), or when BROKEN after being thrown (i.e. the item is "inside" the combo), but it's not doing either of those.

you haven't set the item for it to drop
Checking that flag makes the *item it drops behave as the room's special item*
it does not make it drop an item set in room data or anything
the purpose is to make the item it drops only collectable once

@ runa I finally got it to work. Check the lifting tab on the combos to see how it's set up. Set it like I have to have the item be "inside" the combo, check the flag above to have it be "underneath" the combo.

Okay so @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) the confusion comes from this wording
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055662131560857641/1056395436161761330/image.png?ex=65ed186a&is=65daa36a&hm=559883c6fb3a4d0340c279fa0d8eee28c3bac1089b282882cb3ebc60ecff10f3&)
This implies that this item will be "the Special Item that is set in the room" in the Room Item or Room Type -> Special Item menus, not that it will be "an item that ACTS LIKE a special item by only being collectable once and not timing out"

=== @ P-Tux7 12/25/2022 02:22

I would recommend changing the wording on that infobox to "When checked, the item ID set under "Item Drop" for this combo will be dropped and act as the room's Special Item as seen in the screen's Screen Data 1 tab - it will only be collectable once and not "time out". This overrides and does not take into account the item setting for Special Item Location or Room Type - Special Item."

=== @ P-Tux7 12/25/2022 02:27

I'd possibly also suggest making the Armos->Item flag work on lifted combos, or add a flag to Armos combos to make it so that triggering them drops the Item ID. So that there's a single way for both an Armos and a liftable combo to drop a Special Item.
Not making a feature request yet, I'll see which you think makes more sense.
