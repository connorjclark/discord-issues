Apparently this does not exist. Not sure why, when slash -> next and bush -> next does. Would also include a Flowers -> Next (Continuous) combo type.

I initially though this would be possible by using a bush -> next combo and simply changing the clipping sprite to the flower clippings sprite, however this does not work

bush->Next should be able to do that just fine, please file a bug report if that isn't working
