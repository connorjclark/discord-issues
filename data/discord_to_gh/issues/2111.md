Nice list of 1. 1. 1. And 1.
Doing lists out as separate messages is actually better, so they can be replied to individually
Note that the room guy stuff would need to know the dmap flag, which uh, zq doesn't know

=== @ P-Tux7 12/27/2022 08:36

? Isn't that all Screen Data?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2022 08:37

No, there's the dmap flag that determines
if it shows in the room itself
or if it shows in screen 80

I reaally appreciate "tactile/preview" stuff in editors like Mario Maker, and you already have some of this in ZQuest with the dungeon doors and how the screen's Special Item is displayed where you set it to be. I have a few suggestions that could help wean newbies into knowing what they're placing down/setting even before they test. These are all GUI things displayed by ZQuest generated on the fly - no data is ever saved to the quest file. These visual effects would also be toggleable.

1. Enemy Tiles over Enemy Combo Flags - For example, set the Screen Enemy 0 to be a Red Moblin, place down a Spawn Screen Enemy 0 flag, and the first tile of the Red Moblin will be displayed on top of it.
2. Guys - The screen's selected Guy (and their fires, should that QR be on) is displayed whenever a Room Type that spawns a Guy is set. Perhaps a fade over the Z1-style "unwalkable zone", if that QR is on?
3. Room Types - The Guy's Special Item, Three Warp Stairs, rupees for Free Money/gambling/info/More Bombs/More Arrows, and Heart Container or Red Potion will be displayed when these room types are set. Possibly with fading to represent how they are not the room's Special Items.
4. Shop Items - Shop Items and Take Only One items will be displayed where they usually spawn.
5. Z1 Bosses - If the Z1 Bosses Respect Spawn Positions rule is off, Aquamentus, Gleeok, and Patra will display at their hardcoded/enemy-set (for Aquamentus and Gleeok) starting points.
6. Zelda Fires - a very small thing, but if this room type is set, the Enemy #085 tiles are drawn at their usual place.
Ere we go

I would make the enemy tiles togglable, and the "room type related stuff" toggleable, as 2 toggles

=== @ P-Tux7 12/27/2022 08:40

Also yeah it WAS a numbered list and STILL IS when I *copied the message text to the clipboard*. It just showed them all as "1." WTF Discord?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2022 08:40

but, zq would need to know the dmap for anything in-room
....or it would need a viewing option
like the view layer 2 as background option that is available as a favorite command

=== @ P-Tux7 12/27/2022 08:41

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I would make the enemy tiles…"): OH yeah I definitely mean toggles, sorry, will add that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2022 08:41

Sounds like a good idea, really
though I feel like it'd be @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)'s area to add
and, it's certainly not the highest priority at the moment
but, definitely something we should add eventually

=== @ Alucard648 12/27/2022 17:57

And what about customizable script specific editor metatags?

=== @ P-Tux7 12/28/2022 00:16

Explain?

=== @ Alucard648 01/03/2023 00:02

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Explain?"): For instance, black hole radius visualization.
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=487
Laser fire visualization in ZQuest.
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=418

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 00:03

.... How the heck would you expect that to work?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2023 00:04

You'd need some sort of script support for ZQuest itself in order to recognize the FFC or such settings and draw to the screen based on it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 00:04

Which is NOT happening

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2023 00:05

Sounds kind of niche because scripters are the people who tend to need visualization the least
Except for script users, I suppose

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 00:05

That's literally tearing zq in half and throwing it in a blender and then trying to put it back together
