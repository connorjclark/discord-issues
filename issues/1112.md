Clicking out of the window or hitting the buttons to the right of the text box reverts the value back to positive if it's less than 1

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:34

in your build, if you backspace everything out of the field and then press `-`, does a `-` sign appear in the textfield?

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:34

Yes it does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:35

then you have that other issue fixed, this is separate, fun
give me a minute
....oh
I already see it
how am I that dumb?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:37

```cpp
v = atoi(tempstr);
v *= 10000;
if(v < 0)
    v -= atoi(ptr);
else v += atoi(ptr);```
spot the obvious logical flaw
so, now, ```cpp
v = atoi(tempstr);
v *= 10000;
if(tempstr[0] == '-')
    v -= atoi(ptr);
else v += atoi(ptr);```a bit smarter
just waiting for it to build
Also need you to test script access for `int Attrishorts[8];`
if you can

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:38

joy
The other combo script issue isn't getting fixed any time soon I assume? I'm kinda on a tight schedule, quest contest and all
Not to rush you guys or anything. Just saying if I can't test all these bugs, yeah there's reasons

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:40

I did the attrishorts earlier, before looking at that, just didn't take the time to build it
will try to take a look at it now, especially with zoria's response to help

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:41

gotcha

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:46

Seems to still have the issue?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:46

really, that didn't fix it?
hmm

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:47

lemme double check to make sure I didn't do a dumb

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:48

yeah it's still the same
Ah. But it fixed it on the hex button specifically

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:49

oh fek
I see
I fixed the read from the string to the value
but not the write from the value to a string
...and fun fact, `sprintf()`'s `%X` arg doesn't handle negative values at all.
So the hex mode already has special handling for negatives

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:50

Neat
Another small detail in this dialog
When I have a decimal place selected and type another number in, it doesn't take kindly to that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:51

oh?

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:51

Used to be it'd shift over the last place and remove it, now it just doesn't let me input anything without deleting one of the 0's

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:51

?????
so right now

like this
I press `2`

now like this
oh wait
I see

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:52

Yeah it works for numbers in front of the decimal, not the back

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:52

brain isn't working right now

huh
ok

Here's how 2.53 handled it
Mistakenly thought it shaved off the last decimal place

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:53

oh of course
because 2.53 literally uses a plaintext field, for the record
just with a numeric/`-`/`.` character filter
it has no idea what value is stored inside it
until the dialog closes entirely
the new system constantly stores the value, every single time you type a character

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:54


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/898035618335035392/898040946694946846/unknown.png?ex=65e92c4e&is=65d6b74e&hm=fcab6e68f56e0b97210a3e4161ca1dbefb8fc7aea1d475d5b901602a2c08ecf2&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:54

so that it can update when you click the button
oh wow that doesn't even have a numeric filter
that's extra fun

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:54

it's pretty great

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:54

it just runs the string through `atoi`

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:54

It at least recognizes not to read these as garbage data

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 02:54

or, well, if it detects any `.` in the string, it uses a special version
aye
that's what `atoi` does
it reads the value as an integer
and when it hits an invalid character, it instantly just stops
so if the first character is invalid, it just returns `0`
I have an idea on how to handle that slightly better
(do the attrishorts work, btw?)

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2021 02:56

Haven't tested. Actually gotta get back into dungeon design now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 03:02

ahk, seem to have fixed both the negative and the decimal places issue
...though how the decimal places one was fixed, is not how you would expect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 03:03

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/14/2021 04:03

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíCannot input negative script arguments less than 1

=== @ Moosh 12/27/2021 07:57

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Turns out this wasn't actually fully fixed. It still happens with all the other number fields in the FFC editor ü§¶

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2021 11:31

ah crap
something's broken in the actual string parsing function

=== @ Moosh 12/27/2021 11:32

Ah, is that it?
I figured both tabs were using different settings for text fields
Because the first tab lets you type anything while the script one is restricted to numbers only

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2021 11:33

the base parsing function for strings is shared
the difference is the second tab has fancy fields that restrict the input

=== @ Moosh 12/27/2021 11:34

I see. So that input restriction was unrelated to the string parsing fix?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2021 11:34

correct

=== @ Moosh 12/27/2021 11:34

Script tab is still working fine btw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2021 11:35

building a hopeful fix now

=== @ Moosh 12/27/2021 11:42

All appears to be in working order
I assume this build still has the funky stuff going on that makes it inadvisable to use?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2021 11:43

Deedee noticed some memory wonkiness
could be something bad, could be something minor

=== @ Moosh 12/27/2021 11:44

I reported this on behalf of tacochopper, so I'll let him know the fix is pending üëç

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2021 11:45

See, the only problem now is
I hate this dialog, looking at it
and now I really want to remake it in the new gui system so it's better

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/28/2021 14:52

sooo
