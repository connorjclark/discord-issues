I found a discrepancy with the bottle system. When Link fills up my bottle (4), it shows a different sprite than it should.

This is after catching the fairy

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:05

Come to think of it, where does it even get the sprite from??

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:08

My guess is you didn't read the setup instructions in the `?` on the bottle item
it changes the tile based on what its' filled with
...oh
or there's some info that isn't in the right place
not your fault if the instructions were literally missing

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:09

this is all i see lol

LOL

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:09

So uhhh
If you do `File->New`
and go to tile page 90

The AFrames set on the bottle item determine how many frames each is

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:10

Ah, so you CAN do half potions.

`When used, becomes type: 6`

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:11

Yeah, I have those set up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:11

perfect way to create however much a chain of potions you want

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:14

So I should just set it to 1 then
The AFrames

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:14

if you want non-animated bottles, then aye

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:14

Hm, still giving me the weird sprite
Also, shouldn't it show the name of the new item on the subscreen?
Like Red Potion or whatever?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:17

(replying to @ Jared "Also, shouldn't it show the n…"): ....I thought I added that, but I don't see it anywhere, so clearly I forgot
(replying to @ Jared "Hm, still giving me the weird…"): Screenshot your tile setup and item editor setup?

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:18

(ignore the net above the name I /think/ that's a tile error

I got the fairy to work now though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:35

(replying to @ Jared "Hm, still giving me the weird…"): ?

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:43

I got it to work fine lol
Just the whole name thing is odd

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:48

also it's displaying the net there
what's up with that? Is that a setup error on your part, or is something wrong?

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:58

Yeah, that was a weird error on the subscreen
I think it was showing current item or something

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 04:00

what is placed there on the subscreen, exactly?

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 04:42

I think it was current item

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 04:47

with what settings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 05:01
