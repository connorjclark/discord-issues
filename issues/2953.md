The ability to map an input to multiple keybindings so both buttons can be used for the same action. (This being for ZC, the player).

Such as, say, having multiple inputs on the users side for like, the A button or the Start button, etc.

by the fact that this already exists in zq, I'm going to assume that you mean for ZC
...given that scripts have access to your bindings, this is a bit more complex

Oh, yeah, for Zelda Classic the player.
