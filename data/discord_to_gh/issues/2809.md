You can still click on the other things, and they will become visible one at a time

*sigh*
I thought we fucking fixed this
I do not have the energy to touch the scrollpane crap again
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) maybe you can figure this one out?
assuming it was properly fixed before, I would wager something to do with the `D_DIRTY` dialog stuff re-introduced it? ...that's assuming it was properly fixed before and not just like sometimes happening or something

This menu was not in A119, and the bug is present since this dialog was refactored, so I'm stuck at doing a bisect. where else can I see this issue occur?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/01/2023 21:11

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "assuming it was properly fixe…"): if this had any impact it should still render everything after a small delay (see `do_zqdialog` - `num_idle_frames`)

What I tried (didn't fix anything but seems more correct):

Stepping away from this for now. If someone would like to assist, finding another scrollpane that exhibits this behavior (that's been around longer than the one in Init Data) and doing a bisect would help a lot.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 03:18

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Stepping away from this for n…"): combo editor USED to have one, though it was removed (because people kept missing that they could scroll down and we got a lot of confused reports from people who... didn't scroll down)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 03:19

combo pool editing would *theoretically* have it, though I'm not able to reproduce it with a quick test
hmm, but it reproduces fine in the init data like instantly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 03:21

Yeah I only need to hit up arrow on scroll pane
Then click a text input

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 03:21

so, uh, aside from the OLD version of the `Attribs` tab in the combo editor, the answer is "nothing"
I just checked every `ScrollingPane` found in all files of the source
because most scrollpanes don't have textfields
combo pools do, but it does not recreate the issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 03:56

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "This menu was not in A119, an…"): also, like, I have a feeling that a bisect wouldn't help at any level
this probably goes back to scrollpanes implementation in the first place
because, like, they've been pretty buggy the entire time
took a lot of fixes to get them as functional as they are now
(or at least a lot of debugging)
