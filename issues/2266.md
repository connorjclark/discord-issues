A right click command for the tile and combo pages that moves everything currently visible down 260 tiles/255 combos, creating a fresh blank page. This would function identically to the "Move" command in that it preserves the tiles' associations. Any overflow past the bottom of the last combo/tile page is cut off/dumped as normal.

....hmm
So, for tile pages
you can highlight an entire page
and press `I`
that just works for inserting
...but there's no good way to remove, as an undo for that
and combos can't insert more than 1

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 23:23

wait so it moves everything else down, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:23

Yeah

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 23:23

i actually didn't know you could do that
i've always been just highlighting everything past a certain page and then moving it one page down... üò≥

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:23

oof üò¶
I need to add removing as an opposite to inserting, and make the combo pages one work for a highlighted area.
but inserting for tile pages works

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 23:23

oh yes please for combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:25

also have you noticed the combo page animation?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:30

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i actually didn't know you co‚Ä¶"): oh, and uh, you can actually use keyboard, hold shift and use page down to select page at a time
....and if you then press `I` you can insert *multiple* pages at once.
(The highlighted area size is the inserted area size)

Bleh, you CAN remove in tile pages, you hold shift

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 22:22
