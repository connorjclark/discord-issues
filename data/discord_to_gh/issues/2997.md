Changer FFCs should not count for trigger groups or other. Making this change has caused numerous replays to fail, with what appears to be *crashing error codes*, but I cannot reproduce any issue locally (even in ASAN mode, the replays that are failing in CI succeed for me without any issues found....) @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
currently on `main` of my fork

moved it to `ffctest` to be a more appropriate branch
and pushed to origin as that

When something crashes in CI, on mac and ubuntu there will be stack traces you can inspect. If a crash happens in a python test file it should just be printed to the GHA stdout. For replays, it will be saved in that replay runs `stderr.txt`, which you can get at by downloading the corresponding artifact in the workflow summary page. I did that, here's what I got:

Is this enough to go off of?
(FYI the actual contents of stderr.txt is gonna include ANSI control codes for color stuff, so its hard to read as raw text ... unless you `cat` or `less` or otherwise print it in a terminal)

BAH IT UNSIGNS THEM THERE

and has no sanity

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 23:05

hopefully that passes now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/20/2024 03:05

k, yep, passed, and pushed to main
@ Deathrider this should also be testable in the next build

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/21/2024 18:32

Can this be closed?

=== @ Deathrider 01/22/2024 02:04

confimred to be fixed
