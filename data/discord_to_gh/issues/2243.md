Testing in alpha 112. Strings from any quest in 2.10 or older seem to pop into existence instantaneously, as if you were holding down the B button. This doesn't happen in 2.50 or newer quest.

....yeah, uh, the default values in init data got fucked up at some point!
simple fix, stupid that it needs to be done. My fault.
