Not sure if this can be fixed, but when inserting combos, it changes the bottle combos and thus "breaks" the bottle shop items

Not a huge problem, but was just wondering it could save a headache for someone later

You're so quick
I'll try it when I change combos again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 01:23

```cpp
for(auto q = 0; q < 256; ++q)
{
    for(auto p = 0; p < 3; ++p)
    {
        if(misc.bottle_shop_types[q].comb[p] >= copy && misc.bottle_shop_types[q].comb[p] < copy+copycnt)
            misc.bottle_shop_types[q].comb[p] += tile-copy;
    }
}
```
that's all I had to add

=== @ Jared 02/26/2022 01:23

Nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 01:24

```
for(each bottleshop)
  for(each combo in each bottleshop)
    if(combo is in the changed range)
      move combo```
this should affect both `insert` and `move`
(it looks like `insert` just.... calls a giant `move`)
