NPC Defenses seem to be broken somewhat.  See example quest with script running
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1028546822454644746/1028547293802135582/testDefense.qst?ex=65e411d0&is=65d19cd0&hm=6b5b933c2a0f8ffcc890dc471f8edc095d3c8b0fb917b4751c40c2f4b18f8028&
Script is:
```#include "std.zh"

npc script setDefese {
    void run() {
        Trace(this->Defense[LW_SWORD]);
        this->Defense[LW_SWORD] = NPCDT_IGNORE;
        Trace(this->Defense[LW_SWORD]);
        Waitframes(120);
        Audio->PlaySound(10);
        this->Defense[LW_SWORD] = NPCDT_NONE;
        Trace(this->Defense[LW_SWORD]);
    }
}```
this is set to run on the octorok on the test screen.  This octorok has Sword defense set to "Ignore" in editor.  Bugs encountered:
Tracing (this->Defense[LW_SWORD]) the first time prints 0.  It should print 13 since the enemy was set to Ignore in editor.
Setting the defense value in-script seems to work on this line: 
`this->Defense[LW_SWORD] = NPCDT_IGNORE;`
but the enemy defense cannot be set back to None.  These lines trace as expected:
```        this->Defense[LW_SWORD] = NPCDT_NONE;
        Trace(this->Defense[LW_SWORD]);```
but the enemy is immune to the sword permanently despite that

Sorry if this is a bit rambling.  The trace statements and actual gameplay are not aligned so it's not clear to me what the actual bugs are, it's just clearly not working correctly

what the *fuck*??

=== @ mitchfork 10/09/2022 06:25

yeah, it's a weird one.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't (both via  enemy editor and script).  Seems consistent, though?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2022 06:26

the script reads from the same exact array that the actual defense does
so the traces should BY DEFINITION align with the gameplay

Well it starts set to ignore
but the trace
reads it wrong?
and uhh

yeah
that's just
wtf

=== @ mitchfork 10/09/2022 06:32

Yeah, I was really trying to unbreak a boss that got borked when I updated versions, and found.... whatever this is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2022 06:51

....oh
for fucks
🤦‍♀️ there's no fucking bug here
your script is just *wrong*
@ mitchfork
and I'm facepalming myself that I didn't notice your script's error immediately
You're doing
`this->Defense[LW_SWORD]`
`LW_SWORD`, the weapon type constant
instead of `NPCD_SWORD`, the enemy defense constant
`LW_SWORD == NPCD_BOMB`, as it happens, so you're reading/writing the bomb defense accidentally.

=== @ mitchfork 10/09/2022 11:58
