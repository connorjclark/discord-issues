When I try to add a Text Box to a subscreen, when i press OK after setting it all up it crashes ZC.
also if i don't type anything it not only does it "work", but it also seemingly adds random keys to it.
*Happens with Text Boxes specifically, things like Text and Selected Item Name still work normally*

....not bothering with this, my subscreen branch is mostly done which rewrites the entire subscreen sooo
