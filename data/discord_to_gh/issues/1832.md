This would be super useful to have combos change in other rooms after viewing strings such as in cutscenes, NPC dialogue, or wordless invisible strings. This is practically a game-wide event flag system and non-script access to it would make for some revolutionary quests, as seen by TabletPillow's use of Screen State Carryover and dummy item checks in quests like Link: Rank 9, The Glory Squad, and The Rosemaster. Those are some of the most dynamically changing through the game quests I've seen, really like a real Zelda game does, and making this new GSwitch technology easier to use would result in some more great ones.
