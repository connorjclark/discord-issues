See title. This enemy shoots way too quickly to ever let Link get a hit in, especially in old quests where it's only vulnerable to melee weapons. A script would also be okay in my book but @ DeletedUser may or may not want that

I think this needs to be addressed.  I'd prefer an enemy editor window (in frames) for shot delay

I absolutely like the idea of being able to adjust this. I made an FFC script in my 6rh quest where, if there were two or more EW_FIREs onscreen, it would set the gleeok's weapon to EW_NONE until the fires went away, making it so it could only fire two at a time (technically I think I made it a script argument, so you could just change the number arbitrarily to limit exactly how many fires)
I also liked the idea of trying to make the fire gleeok flash as a warning before it shoots (a la Trinexx), but didn't implement such a thing in that script.

@ Mitsukara check my thread in #deleted-channel about enemy rebalancing, your scripts could be a huge help

i know npc scripts have something about "reverse direction" that could be useful for my anti-homing ideas for gleeok heads/patras

Could we have some test quests of these scripts @ Mitsukara ?  Like to see these in action
