This quest rule is marked "Buggy, use at own risk" so here's a bug - this will cause all LWeapons to pierce enemies, regardless of whether they should or not.
E.g., a normal level 1 arrow should not pierce enemies, but does with this rule checked

yeah, the rule is marked buggy for a reason
don't use it
