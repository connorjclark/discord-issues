- Player is given the lift glove via Init Data. He can pick up a rock or a bush just fine using Ex1 (what I have it set to).
- Player cannot throw the rock or the bush after he picks it up, just carries it around.
- Leaving the screen, entering water, or falling into a hazard like lava or a hole removes the lifted item.
- After the lifted item is removed or breaks from being dropped after entering a hazard, the glove no longer allows you to pick things up.

(replying to @ Whiterose "- Player is given the lift gl‚Ä¶"): need more than that (probably a quest) because it works 100% fine for me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:21

(can lift, can throw, can fall in a hazard while lifting and pick up more after, all working 100% fine)

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:21

I may have missed a step but I set it up copying from the default quest and it just doesn't want to throw things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:22

There is no possible way to set it up wrong to cause that
if you can lift, you can throw

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:22

I had a theory that it might have been related to the dropdown for weapon types being broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:22

...what does that have to do with it?

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:22

nothing as I discovered

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:23

but yeah the only way I could think of this happening is some sort of script interference
or a bug, but like, I'll need more to go on, probably a quest where the issue occurs

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:23

Not working in my test quest still

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:24

then that quest file would be perfect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:27

won't be able to do much without it

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:27

Just set it up for better testing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:27

üëç

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:28

made it so you can walk off the screen and set the dmap to the correct screen

There you go
Lift is EX1 by the way theres no prompt for it yet

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:29

aye, aware; I tested with Ex1 too since you mentioned that in the reproduction steps
hopefully I can find it quick

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:35

...needing to rebuild my build to be sure its latest and it's taking forever

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:38

OK, well
your quest has an absolute BOATLOAD of compat rules enabled
and clearing those fixes it
so, the answer is "you are using old buggy behavior on purpose, that's why it's buggy"

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:39

Darn
so its me being a dumbass

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:39

not sure what qr it would be specifically
but yeah, you generally don't want compat rules on unless you know what they do when making a new quest
there's a reason it pops up telling you that there are bugfixes available when you open a queswt

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:43

`Broken Input Down State`, makes the game just not recognize button presses in certain situations.
Makes the entire system for lift gloves/roc's feather being "passively on a button" not work at all
so yep, that'd do it!

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:48

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "but yeah, you generally don't‚Ä¶"): Probably on because its EZGBZ but reworked
should have looked through the quest rules before doing anything tbh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:49

(replying to @ Whiterose "Probably on because its EZGBZ‚Ä¶"): if you have default settings, it should literally pop up every time you open the quest telling you there are bugfixes to apply

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1206188144668442716/1208998742666256444/image.png?ex=65e552d2&is=65d2ddd2&hm=37df4dea58cd2ce9917d0cf5dc2fc30a918715ec0b6d8fe117fe7a5b0f719c12&)

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:51

that doesn't pop up.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:51

then you probably told it not to show this message again

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:52

I dont remember that ever showing up but its possible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:52

look for `dsa_compatrule`/`dsa_compatrule2` in `zquest.cfg`
(configs starting with `dsa` stand for `don't show again`)

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:52

what should it be set to?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:53

`1` means it won't show
`0`, or just deleting it, means it will

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:53

its 1
so I must have

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:53

then you told it not to show again yeah

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:53

there it is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2024 04:55

yep yep yep, that'd do it lol

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:55

quit and reload to check

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 04:56

oops
I clicked dont show again

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 05:01

thankyou for proving I am a dumbo

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/19/2024 05:20

@ Whiterose jw, if on the Quest / Rules page you saw that there was a text saying "warning: you have x compat rules disabled", would you have addressed them?
I think we need a better system than a Bug The User At Startup alert

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 05:24

I probably would have addressed them because I am using a quest that was from an older engine

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 05:25

having it not show as a popup was a user error but I don't remember ever clicking that option
