Was doing my redo of 3rdEX, made two enemies, the traditional Ganon, and a copy called "True Ganon", which is powered up.  Took off the spawn Ganon rooms for default Ganon, this worked fine for Level 9.  Then did the "real" Level 9, and Ganon showed up, not True Ganon.  Mind you this was in test mode, not in a real quest

1. Make both rooms NOT Ganon rooms
2. Select each enemy in the room enemy list

If you want True Ganon to be in a Ganon room, edit the ORIGINAL Ganon, which is the one that shows up in Ganon rooms. This is what 4th Quest did. His enemy # is currently hardcoded. And make the "Z1" Ganon that precedes him in the quest the copy
I'm not sure if this will be solved in the future by selecting which enemy # spawns in Ganon rooms, or just by letting you set Ganon enemies in the enemy editor to do the Ganon room stuff. But not right now.

Ganon is fucking weird
and is easily one of the buggiest and most spaghetti bullshit things
in all of zc

Needs more testing

direct all ganon inquiries and complaints to deedee

=== @ NightmareJames 03/27/2022 00:13

Nvm, I fixed it
Plus gave "fake" Ganon a different palette
I switched endgame Ganon to the hardcode as instructed and made Ganon Z1 a copy and a different number and enabled the rule
Took some work but it worked
Fake Ganon throws fireballs, Real Ganon throws bats
(which real Ganon's do a lot more)

Ganons can summon?!?
You're AWFUL

=== @ NightmareJames 03/27/2022 00:26

No, just a sprite replacement
So he acts like LTTP

Hmm... would be a nice EWeapon script
The phase 3 circling ones
