@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) something I would really appreciate for when I get to redrawing the enemies. A QR that:

-Walking Enemies: All Rope-type walkers use the row (TilesY * 2) below their starting tile when they are charging at Link. Vire-type walkers and Pols Voice-type walkers use the row (TilesY * 2) when they are hopping. Pols Voice no longer use the Special Tile for their hopping tiles. All Eating/Like-Like enemies use their Special tile while holding Link. Or should it be X rows below their tiles to faciliate shielded and Pols Voice Like-Likes? I absolutely loathe that idea, but it IS an editor possibility. I guess the rows should stack when the enemy has a shield, can jump, can eat, and/or has its animation type set to use firing frames.

-Tektites: All Tektites use the row (TilesY * 2) below their starting tile right before jumping, and the row (TilesY * 3) below their starting tile while in the air.

-Keese, Ghinis, Peahats: The enemy's first row is used while idle. The row (TilesY * 2) is used while flying.

-Wallmaster: All Wallmasters use the row (TilesY * 2) below their starting tile when holding Link.

-Dodongo: A third row of tiles is used for when the Dodongo is "smoked"/idle.

-Manhandla: The "firing" row of sprites is actually used

-Gohma: Gohmas use four 3x1 frames of animation. The row (TilesY * 2) is used when they are about to open their eye, and the row (TilesY * 3) is used while their eye is open.

-Gleeok: The row below the tiles for both types of heads (normal and flaming) is used when that head fires.

-Patra: A separate row of tiles is used for the inner circle and core while they are vulnerable. Sorry that this is some complex math.

-Ganon: This can be hashed out further when the Ganon code revamp is further along in development.

I'd really appreciate the Peahat and Patra ones because it doesn't visually make sense at all in Zelda 1.

It might be a bit to get to this
Sounds good though
