As of the 2023-04-03 nightly build of 2.55, the "ZC Player" and "ZQ Creator" buttons have gotten smaller. This has the effect of making them harder to see, harder to click, and likely more confusing for first-time players because their small size and positioning make them appear to be unimportant.

and it *SQUISHED* the buttons
because they no longer could *fit on the screen*

fixed, though the next nightly is already building without this fix
....should be as simple as adding this to the nightly, though, if you'd like not to wait
