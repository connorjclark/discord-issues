Adding a `trigger script` flag to the triggers tab. When triggered, like with a weapon, the combo runs its script, _then_ triggers

....sounds absolutely painful

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2022 23:24

I'm.... just gonna go with no?

=== @ vlamart 11/01/2022 23:32

Then a `TriggeredBy[]` system for `combodata`?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2022 23:33

that.... would be a very weird thing
because, it would be cleared if the combo changed
and would only be accessible from that combo's combo script
like `pos`/`x`/`y`
because it isn't attached to the combo ID, but the combo location on screen
I'm also gonna have to go with no
...it would also require a lot of rewriting blocks of code that call the combo trigger code, as the stuff that actually does the triggering is not centralized anywhere, it's scattered throughout the source
What specifically are you *trying to do* here?
why are you asking for these?

If hit by arrow, combo change 1, if by boomerang. 2. Things like that, but to take advantage of more complicated things like the lense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2022 23:38

yeah, uh....
this would require way too much rewriting of the triggers system to accomodate
