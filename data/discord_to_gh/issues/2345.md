I could've sworn this one was requested and completed in the past but I sure don't see a quest rule or setting for it. Maybe it's one of those things Zoria lumped into Epilepsy Protection. When the quest rule Enemies Flicker When Hit is active, it flickers every other frame like 0-1-0-1. This is both kinda nasty looking when it works and also messes with recording at lower FPS. I'd recommend a rule that makes the enemy animate on twos (0-0-1-1) as I do in most of my scripts. Or better yet, a var in Init Data that lets the player freely control flicker speed.

If it's in InitData, would be neat if you could choose the CSets it flashes

Maybe it should be a customizable general flicker rate/timer that applies to all of the following at once
-flickering hurt enemies
-flickering enemy spawns (Armos/Ghini 2s)
-flickering enemies (Ghini 2s)
-Dodongo flicker
-flickering Link
-flickering appearing items
-flickering disappearing Guys
