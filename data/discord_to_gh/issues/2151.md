Wasn't able to find a minimal example of this but here's my whole script file. This block is where the issue occurs:
```        printf("++ListSize %d\n", ListSize);
        ++ListSize;
        printf("++ListSize %d\n", ListSize);```
It thinks ListSize is 0 even if it isn't.

Broke it down with traces
the `MapCombos` array.... is giving an array pointer of value equal to the `pos` local function parameter.
Something's fucky

*sigh*
It's because you're calling a constructor
from inside a function of a different class
apparently that wasn't properly tested
and the THISKEY register is being overwritten improperly

....bleh, or at least I thought that was it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2023 12:15

ah, it was
just, using the stack to solve it didn't work because it fucked with stack order
had to instead add another dummy register

no more errors, seems to work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2023 12:20

@ Moosh please test when you can, build on the way now
this and #2150 both, if you can

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2023 12:32

Also additional note, testing inheriting-constructors would be good
ex.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2023 12:34

```cpp
class Foo
{
    Foo()
    {
        //Do basic things every Foo object needs
        Trace(420);
    }
    Foo(int a)
    {
        Foo(); //Call the above constructor as PART of this one, so that all that code runs
        //And then do some other stuff too
        Trace(a);
    }
}```
(though more complex cases, like your carving stuff, would be good)
basically here:
calling `new Foo()` would trace 420
calling `new Foo(5)` would trace 420, then trace 5.

This one seems fixed. sorry for the late response
