Basically the title of this thread.

I'm not sure if this would be hard to add, I'd imagine not. (I thought it actually existed already, but I can't find it?)

Basically a toggle to let the three colours drawn by the spotlight combo for the light beam render as transparent rather than solid. (Similarly to if you'd draw them with OP_TRANS in scripts).

oh, there is a QR for this.
NVM.
