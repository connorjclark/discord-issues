At the very least being able to hit Walking/Leever enemies at a perpendicular angle to their travel direction and they get knocked that way, like in BS Zelda. Would also make knocking enemies into water/pits more of a strategy, as well as a possible flag for the Active Shield

perpendicular knockback with engine enemies will make them able to clip into walls
unless we entirely rewrite all enemies
nothing to be done
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîí(QR) Improved Enemy Knockback

I thought they had collision detection with solid combos though? When you knock them back normally

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 16:56

Also, all enemies have collision detection with "no enemies"-flagged combos, even diagonally-moving enemies

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 16:58

the problem is
if they start moving left
then they won't do another solidity check until they are one whole tile left
so
if you hit it PERPENDICULAR
you can hit it right next to a solid wall
in a direction it is moving
and it can walk right through it
because it already checked solidity before the knockback

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 17:00

Wait, how does the quarter-tile enemy solidity check bugfix work then?

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 17:01

Is it that they can only walk onto a combo whose ENTIRE bottom half is walkable? A combo with the left or right side being walkable but not the other would be counted as fully solid by them, even if they were knocked back into the walkable portion they wouldn't actually touch that part and act as though the whole thing was a wall?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 17:04

it used to only check half the combo
not the whole combo
for some reason

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 17:04

yknow i'll check this in a little while and report back

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) would you be capable of doing this?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/16/2022 05:30

my solution to this is to just make afreeform walking enemy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/16/2022 05:32

the big thing is figuring out what values would be useful; random rate and etc don't really work as 16 big values when it's being checked every frame, and LttP enemies seem to instead move in ranges of frames before turning as opposed to tile-based movement

=== @ P-Tux7 07/16/2022 06:07

this would also entail either making a second leever class as well or putting leevers in that freeform walking enemy class
the thing is i don't mind the enemies being on the 16x16 grid... just that you can't knock them sideways (and then they auto snap back to the grid)
BS Zelda has this and it's very nice

=== @ P-Tux7 07/16/2022 06:09

still, thanks a ton for considering it
should make scriptless enemies a whole lot more fun to use
(i.e. most people aren't gonna make their own fun enemies like crucible quest lol)
