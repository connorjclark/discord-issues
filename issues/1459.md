This is mostly an idea related to freeform shutters, but maybe a flag (a whole new combo seems like much) and attribytes to the Conveyer type combos that instead of just push you, it does "no action" (forced no button presses) and forces the player to walk off the combo in that type's direction (speed is player speed or maybe customisable)

=== @ Jennette 03/17/2022 17:37

I presume you mean conveyors that disable Link movement? (i.e you're pushed until you reach a non-conveyor combo)

=== @ vlamart 03/17/2022 17:37

Yes!!

=== @ Jennette 03/17/2022 17:37

I would also like to see the same thing

=== @ vlamart 03/17/2022 17:41

(replying to @ Jennette "I presume you mean conveyors‚Ä¶"): Would also need an option for whether there is walking animation or not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2022 17:43

And if it forces facing dir

=== @ vlamart 03/17/2022 17:46

Oh this would be cute for a conveyer that spins you, but at this point, it just sounds like ice floors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2022 17:47

Yeah, it would kinda work for ice floors...

=== @ vlamart 03/17/2022 17:48

Can ice combo stuff be next big feature endeavour? üòù

@ vlamart
This is NOT necessarily final
feedback would be appreciated

=== @ P-Tux7 04/05/2022 06:53

can this be applied on top of latest nightly?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2022 06:55

aye, it should be

=== @ P-Tux7 04/05/2022 06:58

Great!

it's just 2 new flags here
the problem comes when doing corner conveyors
which the test quest shows
if you get caught on a wall, you regain control

=== @ P-Tux7 04/05/2022 07:00

*choke*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2022 07:03

otherwise you would just get softlocked
so
Now, you COULD try making conveyors that are diagonal for corners
which would likely alleviate issues
and, if deedee ever gets around to making it so you can be on multiple conveyors at once, that should solve corners being weird

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2022 07:05

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
Oh, wait, I have an idea
that should also help

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2022 07:23

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 12:26

I went and chased waterfalls instead of sticking to the lakes and rivers I'm used to.  Anyways I love the new additions! I appreciate that a spiraling conveyer won't force Link into pits. Neatly, though unsure how others will take advantage of it, but if a "stun" conveyer shoves Link into a pit, he falls (as expected) and if isn't a warp pit, will repeatedly push him in. However, you can save him by finessing the controls until he barely clings to the nearest few pixels to the edge

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2022 12:27

Oh, duh
Conveyors need to not count as "safe ground" for respawning

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 12:31

I tried making a waterfall too, same with swimming, where he'll just stand on the edge instead of back to swimming

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2022 12:33

It isn't the pit/water that's the problem, it's that it respawns you on a conveyor

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 12:45

Oh yeah, that's probs

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 12:49

I also had the idea of a shooting gallery mini game, and was hoping "force direction" had attribytes for specific direction, and was wondering if there is a way to "stun" while still being able to use weapons?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2022 12:56

To allow using weapons would require more complex stunning code
And the direction forced is the primary movement direction, where X wins ties with Y on diagonals

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 13:01

Fair enough, just spit balling ideas
Haven't tested it yet, but also are lit bombs or enemies effected by it?

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 13:16

Oooo, also, a flag for boots to cancel conveyer effects?

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 13:21

(I had the idea of using layers to make like "wind tunnels", "Iron Boots" would be neat for this, with a flag on the combo itself to check for the Boots, so that the boots don't effect all conveyers)

=== @ vlamart 04/05/2022 13:24

Sorry for idea dumping, just stoned and feeling inspired. If conveyers effected items and enemies too, you could use them in conjunction with switches to make a conveyer mini game! You could also do that with yourself as a puzzle in a dungeon as is now
