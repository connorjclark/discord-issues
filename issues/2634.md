Windows x64 version on windows 7.
not sure why
I don't really have time to look more into it now, but I figured I should report it

???? Compiling what script
compiling works fine in A117 for everything I've seen, it must be a VERY specific crash
also, err, it quits ZQ???
Not the external parser window?
Parser crashes should not affect ZQ at all
oh, new nightly as well apparently
that has at least some stuff fixed that was kinda bad

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 14:55

the external parser stays open
but just gives the prompt to press any button to exit since ZQ exited
it does not even start to compile the scripts I don't think

huh
that's SUPER weird

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 15:00

yeah, idk

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "???? Compiling what script"): what's the exact script?

Seems like it was a Windows 7 specific problem for FS, might be same missing dll

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/02/2023 17:19

it could very well be the same issue, yeah
getting the specified file and ZQ complains about other missing files on boot
if the dll file is missing it does not complain at all
ü§î
anyway, I think I need several more things than just that
but it does seem to be the same issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 17:25

ahk, fun, windows 7...
fucking outdated oses becoming a problem more and more, and the fact that *windows 7* is starting to fall under *outdated oses* fucking hurts
(replying to @ Mani Kanina "if the dll file is missing it‚Ä¶"): I feel like this is a result of connor's fix to the other issue
pretty sure if that file isn't found it does something else instead, but clearly that fix didn't work quite right?
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) something fucky here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2023 17:29
