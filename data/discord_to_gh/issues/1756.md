The same as Sword and Item Bubbles, but causing the bunny status

And items that can only be used in Bunny ststus.

Touch effect for npc, also (if there isn't already one) as a combo flag

=== @ P-Tux7 07/18/2022 04:04

I think that might need to be put to hurt combos, because too many options for flags
-type of touch effect
-effect strength
-whether Link gets knockback
-counter drain effect while standing on it

Oh, I had no intention of the combo being the one that hurts, just transforms

=== @ P-Tux7 07/18/2022 04:18

Right, but I mean that the options need to go to a combo type, so might as well combine it with damage combos

=== @ vlamart 07/18/2022 04:19

Actually yeah, that's a dope idea
