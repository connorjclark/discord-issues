I thought this was fixed, but when playing this quest, they still look glitched.

dmap 0 screen 125
bugged at least as far back as A108

=== @ P-Tux7 02/12/2024 07:24

it's a quest rule now, so it's definitely weird that it's no getting auto-set for 1.90 BS Link quests

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/12/2024 07:40

which QR?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2024 06:45

2.55-alpha-1 (nov 2018) also broken. cant bisect this, thats earliest I can do.
@ P-Tux7 what qr?
"Expanded Player Tile Modifiers" had no impact
also I cant get 1.92 to run on my machine, can you / are you sure this worked in 1.92?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2024 15:21

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@ P-Tux7 what qr?"): Should be in compat
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "also I cant get 1.92 to run o…"): No, it's 1.90 quests only

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2024 18:01

I can't find the QR you are referring to.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/16/2024 19:17

Thank

=== @ P-Tux7 02/16/2024 19:18

Actually wait, it should be 1.90 *and below* since I think 1.84 had BS animation as well

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/16/2024 19:20

do we have those in the archive somewhere? 1.90 and 1.84 i mean

=== @ P-Tux7 02/16/2024 19:47

ought to be in #deleted-channel but they are also on here
https://www.zeldaclassic.com/download-archive/

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/16/2024 23:49

this quest was saved in 1.92

we only apply this compat rule for 1.90 https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/b093e59c685d2ee65bcacbd231eaf56875874ceb/src/qst.cpp#L3187

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/16/2024 23:53

Would it be incorrect to enable this qr for all 1.92 quests too?

Or should I just check speciifcally for this qst and enable it?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/17/2024 00:08

oh that's weird, it's listed as 1.90 on the database
so even if it is 1.92, there's still the bug of why the swimming tiles aren't working
the tiles ought to be laid out the same as any other 1.92 BS-animation quest

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 00:17

Is it feasible the quest creator made this in 1.90 then upgraded to 1.92 at some point, missing this bug

=== @ P-Tux7 02/17/2024 01:08

yeah, could be

=== @ P-Tux7 02/17/2024 01:09

iirc 1.92 had a really stupid system where you selected the first swimming tile as though it was an item (you know, like how you do in the player tile dialog now)
so maybe they never did set it correctly
since it's just a visual bug i wouldn't worry about it too much anyways

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 01:15

I'll added a specific check for this quest title and call it a day
if we come across more from 1.92 that needs this treatment will do same for them

=== @ P-Tux7 02/17/2024 01:21

The .qst title or the title in the header

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 01:31

I did the title in the header, plus it being version 1.92

=== @ P-Tux7 02/17/2024 07:30

Good, because people can rename the quest filename to whatever they want
