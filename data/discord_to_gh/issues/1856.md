How does the general community feel about backwards compatibility?
1.  Should support be dropped pre-Win 7?
2.  Should we keep developing for x86?
Discuss please

Per this thread, we have discovered that we already are no longer compatible with Windows XP

so, that answers `1.`
Windows 7 support, I see no reason to drop as of yet, until a problem arises that gives us reason to.
2. There's no reason to drop x86 development. We aren't specifically developing for x86 or restricting ourselves based on that at this time, so we gain nothing by dropping it- and it requires nothing of us but an automated build script.

I agree, I think we should still try to support Win 7 as a lot of people still use it
Heck, I'd even like to get the crap laptop reformatted with Win 7 when my life isn't chaotic

What it really comes down to is, we aren't going to choose to drop support, ever
support will drop
when it just breaks on its' own and can't be fixed
ex. XP support dropped because, MSVC 2019+ is incompatible with XP.
nothing we can do to fix that, so, it's done.
so, when we simply cannot support a working x86 version anymore, we'll remove it
and when we simply cannot support win7 anymore, it'll stop working
but not until something forces the break

Would you help me on an OS reinstallation Emily when things calm down?  My laptop is a complete mess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/12/2022 15:19

I have no idea how I would help with that

=== @ NightmareJames 09/12/2022 15:23

I'll post it in the GD then

(replying to @ NightmareJames "Heck, I'd even like to get th‚Ä¶"): I refuse to upgrade my system above windows 7.
