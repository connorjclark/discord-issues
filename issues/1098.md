As of the 98 Alpha I've been running into a strange collision issue, the screen shown in the video clip isn't the only place you can actually do this.

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/09/2021 07:53

It's a 9mb video, the reason why I chose to record it as a video is because I don't think I can quite describe it

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/09/2021 07:55

the video is still uploading

what the hell?

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/09/2021 08:43

yeah, that's what I said.

Could you send me the quest?
need to run it through my debug build cause I'm not reproducing it

Okay this was a really dumb error on my part
the position check for the solidity of the next screen was going out of bounds when scrolling left
fixed

Aye. Let me know if there's any new builds that might finally nail the bug in it's overdue coffin
