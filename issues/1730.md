Add step-> (could be very useful for sideview) and push-> (for things like old school pushing a door open) to the triggers tab

=== @ cbailey78 07/11/2022 00:44

Also add touch-> (Like the sensitive step that triggers when Link's entire hitbox touches it.)

`Step->`, `Step (sens)->`, `ShutterOpen->`
sounds smart

=== @ cbailey78 07/11/2022 02:47

Along with adding Step (Sens)->next combo types as well.  (Great for crumbling bridge in Z2)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/11/2022 10:16

well no
you
would use `Step (sens)->` as the trigger
and `->Next` as the effect

The green is `Step-> (Sensitive)` trigger, the tan is `Step->`; both with the `->Next` effect.

👏👏👏

And `Shutters->` trigger was a lot easier
because
there's literally a function called `openshutters()`
so I just added a trigger to that function
.....now, testing that it worked, I found a damn CRASH, but that's unrelated ( #1748 )

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒More Combo Triggers
any more ideas like this feel free, though make a new thread

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): HALLELUJIA!!!!! 👏

Now for eweapons? 😈

=== @ cbailey78 07/16/2022 21:17

How about directional button triggered warp tiles!  Used for Smb3 doors you push up to enter for sideview gravity screens and other buttons (A, B, X, Y) triggered warps used for Smb3 and Super Mario World level tiles you push B to enter.

I can't wait for the next nightly release for the sensitive step triggers!
