Firstly, the bug Guinevere reported of how the 4-frame idle+moving top-down swimming does not work right.
I think Slash and Pound might be broken as well, or only use the Z1-type data.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 04:15

Slashing is 7 frames horizontally and 6 frames vertically. Should this round to 6?

this isn't bug reports channel

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 04:16

Ok, but the only thing I'll report there is swimming, as the rest would require a QR to change. It would otherwise break old Z3 animation quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2021 04:17

. . . ?\
And that's a reason not to report it WHY?

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 04:17

Just did

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Ok, but the only thing I'll r…"): ^?
why only file a report for swimming
if the others are bugged too

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 04:22

Okay so swimming is A. the only one where the bug fix wasn't designed around by questmakers. That means it can be fixed without affecting older quests. If older quests really had less slash/pound frames than Z3 animation was supposed to, that would have to be fixed with a QR because the bug was designed around.
and B. because I don't actually know how many frames Z3 animation is supposed to be setting those to, but *isn't*
With the swimming thing I at least know it's supposed to be 4.
So I can't report it if I don't know what it's supposed to be like when fixed.

*This is not a reason not to report something*
We have room for literally thousands more QRs
QRs are not in short supply, and do not need to be avoided
...point B, is fair; though you could file a report that there's an issue, and update it if you find out how many it should use

Okay so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2021 04:30

regardless, this should all be in bug reports
not dev discussion

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 04:31

it kind of has overlap with feature requests because there's some animations in Z3 that aren't in ZC yet
like the boomerang animation
so that's what was kind of confusing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2021 04:32

then just pick one
it's not a big deal

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 04:32

ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2021 04:32

but threads in dev discussion are not treated as tickets, and thus will get forgotten about

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 04:46

oh i know, it was meant to compile information before the ticket

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2021 04:55

point being, don't
compile it *in* the ticket
not before
