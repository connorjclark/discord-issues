This might have already been asked or reported, but stretching in full screen is ANNOYING. Can we have it squared off with just the screen growing or shrinking in the square? Also when you pull the edges of the program, it does it too. Very annoying!

Not to be a broken clock, but how does it behave in the latest April build?

https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2023-04-14

=== @ Jared 04/15/2023 20:48

Unfortunately the same.

=== @ Jared 04/15/2023 20:49

If I stretch it I kinda works, but not full screen

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/15/2023 21:44

there should be options in ZLauncher to fix this

=== @ Jared 04/15/2023 21:45

Hm, do you know what options they are? Let me look

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/15/2023 21:46

Might be integer scaling?

=== @ Jared 04/15/2023 21:47

Yeah, that option makes it worse. It makes the entirety of zq wrapped around in a big black box lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/15/2023 21:48

Isn't that what you meant by squared off with just the screen growing in the square?
unsure what you mean

=== @ Jared 04/15/2023 21:48

No, I meant like it being on the sides to not stretch it
I've accepted this isn't a problem tbh
It works when I stretch it fine. I don't even use full screen anyway lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/15/2023 21:50

There's two different scaling modes btw
depending on whether you have Linear Scaling turned on

=== @ Jared 04/15/2023 21:51

Like it stretches on full screen
Versus when in windowed mode it doesn't
Kind of like how when you play GBC games on a GBA and you can switch with with L/R

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/15/2023 21:52

ohh
Like it isn't keeping the aspect ratio when in fullscreen
yeah not sure how to fix that...

=== @ Jared 04/15/2023 21:53

Yeah exactly
Like I said it's not a huge deal.
But it'd be nice if when stretching it in windowed mode it kept the aspect ratio
Except being able to pull on side all the way to the other

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/15/2023 21:54

oh, that's easy

=== @ Jared 04/15/2023 21:54

Yeah, I thought it was in an older build actually

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/15/2023 21:54

check this

=== @ Jared 04/15/2023 22:01

That has worked, yes
Thank you 🙂
I've been using it but it acts a little wonky when it resizes lol
But it works!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 07:03

(replying to @ Jared "This might have already been…"): Fullscreen is fullscreen, it works based on allegro jank.
Windowed has the various options as deedee mentioned, but there's literally nothing we *CAN* do about fullscreen. Fullscreen sucks, and my recommendation of "Never ever ever use fullscreen" still stands (which has been in place since 2.50.2)

=== @ Jared 04/16/2023 08:10

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Windowed has the various opti…"): I'm sorry, I meant full screen as in windowed mode but made full screen. Not full screen itself lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 08:10

oh, lol
then yeah, the options there work.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 08:12

For ZC, the similar options can be accessed via `Settings->Options->Window Settings`

=== @ Jared 04/16/2023 08:14

It's still stretching tho, that's the thing.
But I'll check again when I'm home from work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 08:14

?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 08:15

...oh, so it is
huh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 08:18

oh
@ Jared `Force Integer Values For Scale` is the checkbox you want

=== @ Jared 04/16/2023 08:18

Thank you. I'll let you know if it works later
Is that option in zl?
Because I think I've tried it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 08:19

it's in the launcher yeah

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096887075476873267/1097073717881868328/image.png?ex=65e43284&is=65d1bd84&hm=140b2fde0a690b490a442bc03e84164e789f2c70a4e42f09d623aedea75a8dea&)
this is what it looks like maximized for me with it on
so, no stretch

=== @ Jared 04/17/2023 21:33

That's exactly what I wanted.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/17/2023 22:08

I thought I suggested that
or maybe I wasn't specific and it got mixed up with linear scaling

=== @ Jared 04/18/2023 06:02

Yeah you did Deedee
