I certainly can't be the only one to notice this bug but I was kinda expecting someone else to report it by now. Basically the customv"clippings/decoration" sprites that I have set up for the slashable pottery in my quest don't seem to show up at all and I did set it up correctly.

:sigh: you're using a sprite that has 0 aframes
so you did NOT set it up correctly

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/26/2022 01:23

I set up the pottery clippings identically to the pre-existing bush and grass clippings, which also don't have more than 0 and they seem to work fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/26/2022 01:24

Those do NOT work if they are used as a sprite
they work when they are used as a *hardcoded clippings decoration*

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/26/2022 01:24

Oh. I think I begin to see, it's because those have a hardcoded value... I'm a moron

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/26/2022 01:24

yeah. when making a custom sprite, you need to give it proper aframes info

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/26/2022 01:25

I assumed it would hand itself. My apologies

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/26/2022 01:29

close this.
