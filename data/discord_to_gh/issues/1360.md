Like the screen flag, but for a combo itself. Saves the end user work when using tilesets that have these combos set up properly. I intend to use it in the LTTP tileset for one-time-only animations (opening Misery Mire's main entrance, Skull Woods' final entrance, Ganon's Tower stairs lowering, the lightning bat blocking Hyrule Tower's steeple...) and REDUX tileset will probably appreciate it too for using those same LTTP tiles.
