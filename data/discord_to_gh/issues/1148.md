Link`s awakening Goombas...

i thought the dropset ID was modifiable via script, and the enemy could detect with what weapon it was being damaged
so if it was damaged with stomp boots and hp = 0 change dropset

i think also with NPC scripts it runs for one frame after the enemy gets killed. So if you want to make a stomp effect you just can, nothing like ghost/Newbie Boss where it has to exist at 1 HP to show the death animation
Though I know the walker is currently ghosted

I suppose this is possible, but it would need an alt droplet field in guydata
And some funky stuff in the enemy hit resolution code
Thankfully I did add *wpn to that in the past
But you need to use the resolved wpn type after factoring in simulated weapon types
I.e. overrides
So this would require allowing stomp type for non stomp wpns
But it should be quite feasible
Then again
A five line npc script solves it
switch(this->HitBy)

Case wStomp: itm hrt = CreateItem(this-X,this-Y, I_HEART)
Set hrt flags to a drop item
There is a more abstract case for frozen enemies or enemies destroyed by fire.
But those do not yet exist, so for sideview goombas, a script is a decent stopgap

You may also be able to write this-DropSet based on this->HitBy
Idk if the killl system timing will be happy with that.
