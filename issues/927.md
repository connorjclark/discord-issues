The Knight horse heads are tiles that need to be struck to match up with the other tiles, much like the slot machine enemies do 2 or 3 or 4 will do at max. These Can be found in Level-6 Link's awakening. Idea is for a built in system like this.

This should be a script. Not happening in-engine.

Yeah probably not happening, way too complex
