when u copy a tile and highlight a region of tiles, pasting should fill in the current selection imo
(maybe same for overlaying too?)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2023 12:32

overlaying does do this, if you hold shift

Very unintuitive to have to use overlaying to mass-paste though. Also having to use a key combination to specify mass overlay (or mass paste) is weird when you already are specifying that you want to do it across a region by the very act of selecting a region.

(replying to @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) "Very unintuitive to have to u…"): no no no
because like
you can have multiple tiles  in the copy as well
and mass overlay can't handle that
it just overlays the top-left copied tile over the selection

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 12/21/2023 12:35

you can but if you only *copy* a 1x1, it makes it very unintuitive when you want to paste/overlay to *multiple* tiles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2023 12:36

but having it function differently depending on the size of the copy feels weird
and...tbh this code is awful jank shit anyway

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 12/21/2023 12:36

It already functions differently if you're trying to copy multiple tiles and paste them to a differently sized region though
by virtue of only using the top left tile

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2023 12:37

...fair I suppose
honestly this all needs to be rewritten
which I do not have the energy for

How I'd do it:
If you copy a 1x1 selection:
- if you paste it, it pastes 1x1
- if you select an nxm region, then paste, it pastes a bunch of 1x1 tiles to the whole nxn region
If you copy a nxm selection:
- if you paste it without selecting a region size (so 1x1), it pastes the size of the original selection, nxm
- if you select a region, same as above, alternatively it could just repeatedly tile the selection but that doesn't seem super useful. it could be added later if people wanted it anyways.
Replace paste with overlay for overlaying tiles. Ctrl + O should underlay across a selection too without needing to use shift as well.
I haven't looked at the code myself but I imagine a lot of the current stuff could be reused to implement this.
