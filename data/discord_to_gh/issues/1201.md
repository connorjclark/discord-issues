i never got my problem fixed. I don't know if it is a bug or my error. I posted on the forum about it, and tried everything told to me. so I don't know if that is an error. i tested my game with just giving myself potions, but when i saw I forgot to add where you get the letter, I added the letter and it did not pick up, nor was it able to trade it in to buy potions.

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:02

screen 3 e
loooks like i forgot to put something on  screen 0c

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:05

i'm so far behind in what build we're on now

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:13

it's been so long. i had no clue what i was doing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 11:22

@ likelike on fire on the subscreen, you have the "item override" for the letter position be the red potion

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:23

i was told to do that

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 11:23

by who?

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:23

i really don't recall.
but when i was testing i would just give my self a potion
then i realised i had no letter room
then I got it and it stoped working
this was many months ago
so i did all this thigns and sacrificed an item

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:28

i tried what people told me to do, to fix it
and it did not fix

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:32

that is why it is here. because i did everything i was told to do and it did not fix it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 11:41

I'm guessing you tried to pick up the level 2 magic potion, drank it, and it turned into a blue health potion?

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:41

no
i really don't know what happend.
potions "worked"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 11:42

Well, that's what seems to be happening

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:42

then i saw i had no letter

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 11:42

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@ likelike on fire on the‚Ä¶"): turn item override off and you will have your letter (and blue potion) back

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:44

what is the new build?

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîípotion and letter not working

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:46

i need to get into my other youtube i have a hidden video

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 11:48

@ likelike on fire in the Active Subscreen (the "revision 2 triforce" one), go to the potion/letter item slot
Make sure it is set to "Letter or Potion (Subscreen only)"
this will make it so letters and potions work as they should work
make sure you do this for every subscreen you are using in the quest

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:50

oh.
i wasn't told that

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 11:50

we were very confused back then
However, your quest has magic potions as well. What you want to happen when you use the Level 2 Magic Potion? Do you want to use the Level 2 Magic Potion and have it turn into a Level 1 Magic Potion? When you use that Level 1 Magic Potion, do you want it to turn back into the letter?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 11:52

Also, make sure you have "Item override" turned OFF.

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 11:54

that is the thing
i added them as an after thought in an attmpt to fix the problem

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 12:00

i dont feel good right now so this is hard to comprehend

oh my god
it's been that long

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 12:05

Ah, I see
Yeah, it needs to be "Letter or Potion"
you have it set to "Letter"

=== @ likelike on fire 02/11/2022 12:05

agian, i could of sworn another member told me to put it to letter or potion
but this was in 2020

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 12:15

You might have misinterpreted it maybe?
Maybe you thought they were saying "Letter" or "Potion", not "Letter or Potion"
