I think we should have a random side warp like the random tile warp.

This would be cool
but
it would NOT be easy to implement
sidewarps have 4 states now, which is an even spacing of 2 bits, and they are packed in tightly
so it would require adding more memory to screen, and re-organizing the bit storage of the sidewarp/tilewarp data
...and making sure that gives the proper values to zscript still
Technically doable, but, a lot of work
