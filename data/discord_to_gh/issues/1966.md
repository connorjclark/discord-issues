Right in the title. I'm not sure which exact actions cause this to happen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2022 17:23

well aware
this is due to deedee complaining that the mouse DIDN'T disappear when it exits the window
and the fact that we don't have hardware cursor working yet
so, the solution @ Jared, is to "deal with it". (moving the mouse outside the window and back in should make it reappear, so it's not like it's just gone)
.... @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) hardware mouse shit is *extremely* high priority please

=== @ mitchfork 10/15/2022 17:28

Yeah, when in tile pages, you can't get it to reappear. You can kinda guess to click to exit the tile page and get back to main screen page, which usually gets it back
...could probably ESC too. That's how I've been dealing with it, though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2022 17:33

really?
I thought I fucking specifically fixed it in tile pages

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/15/2022 17:58

I need to get the replay/recording stuff fixed enough for James to start making replays, shouldn't take much longer. Then I'll work on this.
replays are the golden ticket to z3 scrolling not breaking everything lol

=== @ mitchfork 10/15/2022 18:24

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I thought I fucking specifica‚Ä¶"): Maybe mixing it up with combo pages, actually

=== @ Attempt 10/15/2022 18:41

(replying to @ mitchfork "...could probably ESC too. Th‚Ä¶"): you can actually just right click to bring it back, you don't have to exit the tile page

=== @ mitchfork 10/15/2022 18:50

(replying to @ Attempt "you can actually just right c‚Ä¶"): Nice, great to know

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2022 19:07

(replying to @ mitchfork "Maybe mixing it up with combo‚Ä¶"): ...nope, I added the `update_hw_screen` call to `select_tile`
which should have fixed it for tile pages
if that's not working then the answer is even more "deal with it" because I can't begin to understand how to fix that then

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/15/2022 21:39

Need to clear some things up

It seems ZQ was never using hardware cursors, despite calling `enable_hardware_cursor`, because it never called `select_mouse_cursor`. Is it correct to say hardware cursor was never a thing?
And is the request here that we don't use the allegro cursor bitmap, but instead use the actual OS's cursors?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2022 21:45

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Need to clear some things up‚Ä¶"): as far as I am aware hardware cursor was never a thing
but it works far differently in A5 than A4
and multiple times when asked about issues with this you mentioned that using hardware cursor would solve those issues
so, the idea of hardware cursor was *yours*

at least 3 separate high priority issues with the mouse

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/15/2022 21:56

just making sure having a normal cursor is the expectation
we could set it behind a cfg value too
a4 does some funky stuff to make bitmap cursors work
which seems to not play nice with a5

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2022 22:00

if it could be made to work exactly how it used to, that would be ideal
Do note that there is more than one cursor graphic, especially with regards to the tile pixel editor
(every separate drawing tool has a separate cursor associated)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/15/2022 22:04

None of those are "hardware" cursors, though. So we aren't thinking about the same thing right now.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2022 22:04

you're the one that suggested hardware cursor would fix the problems
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/15/2022 22:04

Maybe I didn't consider those custom cursors, I forgot about them.
hmm
let's see if a5 allows uploading bitmaps to the OS
perhaps that's what I was thinking

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2022 22:05

dinner time, be back on later

=== @ Jared 10/15/2022 22:16

Yeah I just close zq and reopen it and it‚Äôs fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2022 22:17

(replying to @ Jared "Yeah I just close zq and reop‚Ä¶"): Just move the mouse out and back in the window
It disappearing is intentional

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2022 22:19

As part of a workaround for another bug

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2022 00:31

ok so i've got a hw_cursor option, defaulting to false, that still respects/uses the custom cursors for the tile editor/do_flags/color editor
people can try it out and give feedback

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2022 00:33

I would default it to true for a few builds so people actually give feedback
(usually if you default something to false and ask for feedback, you're going to get approximately 0 feedback)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2022 00:37

uhh

my cursor is outside the window there
and
the cursor still displays at the top
so, that issue is still present when in the tile editor
and not fixed at all
(meta) thread name was changed: A5 mouse issues
the cursor needs to not draw anywhere at any time if the mouse is not hovering over the zq window

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2022 00:44

so, gonna say that this handles the main screen fine, but completely just doesn't fix the issues if you're in any special cursor mode

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2022 00:46

....which given that it looks like you just switch back to the old way that has all those issues to display the special cursors, makes perfect sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2022 01:53

so, from what I can tell here, it looks like hardware mouse may simply not be the solution for us
However, I did just manage to find another solution that looks to completely solve the issue with the cursor lingering on the screen when it shouldn't
...I took the solution I already had, and I made it into a separate thread
except that crashed, because `show_mouse(NULL)` in a separate thread is a BAD BAD idea because that causes nullpo in the other threads
so instead of using `show_mouse(NULL)` to hide it
I'm now using `set_mouse_sprite` to set the sprite to a 1x1 invisible bitmap
and restore it to the previous sprite on re-enter
with a wrapper `zc_set_mouse_sprite` now used instead of `set_mouse_sprite` everywhere in the source, except in this one function
result: looks identical to before a5 upgrade behavior, at least for the *not disappearing* issue
(does not help the scaling issue)
.....fuck
me
except it just crashed
so something's wrong still
yay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2022 02:02

......fuck
the same crash from `show_mouse(NULL)` happens
because fucking
`set_mouse_sprite`
calls
fucking
`show_mouse(NULL)`
ok, so there goes that whole idea
separate thread bad

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2022 02:17

HAH! I THINK I FOUND THE PROBLEM!!!! @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
in `mouse.c` there's a variable
called `_mouse_on`
it's a bool
Ctrl+F'ing through allegro legacy source..... it is ***NEVER MODIFIED BY ANYTHING***, so it is always true
....looking at the allegro 4 source, it's modified by quite a few things
for quick reference, branch `2.55-pre-al5` I created from just before al5 stuff was merged
it looks like this variable not being properly set by anything is the actual root cause of the mouse not disappearing when out of the screen issue
the variable `_mouse_on` needs to be `true` while the mouse is within the display, and `false` if it is outside the display
this SHOULD be able to be handled with a thread/event queue like I was doing before
except it can't be in our code because dll extern shit or something?
I don't have the energy to actually fuck with this
right now
but this is the actual issue that needs fixing
which is a bug with allegro legacy itself

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2022 02:22

Cool, that makes a lot of sense. The drivers would be responsible for that, which is why we can't find anything writing it now (allegro legacy replaced old a4 drivers with the a5 glue code)
nice find.
I'll try to pick it up from there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2022 02:26

also fixed a separate issue where the mouse was clipping through text in `jwin_alert` calls
(it was using `d_ctext_proc` from allegro, which does not `scare_mouse` properly)
(...so I made `d_ctext2_proc` which just scares the mouse wrapping `d_ctext_proc` and switched everywhere that used the latter to use the former)
whew

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2022 05:22

well i spent the last 3 hours fixing an allegro 5 bug
the fix was deleting a single line of code
(mac only)
sigh.
this paired nicely with that replay bug fix from before (the B item‚Äìthat was _adding_ a line of code)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2022 05:53

Pushed a probable fix for proper cursor hiding/showing - most of the time I spent on debugging that osx-specific issue. I don't think Windows will have anything similar to it, but I can only hope.
I'll start a nightly now.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/19/2022 10:05

umm
just noticed an issue
with `hw_cursor = 0`, I'm seeing the hardware cursor AND the bitmap cursor, in all menus

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/19/2022 10:06

....the hiding is fixed, at least

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/19/2022 17:03

Sorry, can't test on windows. I figured something like that might happen.
I'll try something real quick.
The mac drivers differ in an annoying way.
So maybe just need to do al_hide_cursor on start up for _just_ windows if hw_cursor = 0
is this for zelda zquest or both

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/19/2022 18:53

zquest and zlauncher, not zelda though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/19/2022 21:04

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) so one thing deedee found is

this function pointer is null now, but it wasn't prior to allegro 5
it appears this would allow custom cursor graphics on a hardware cursor

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/24/2022 19:07

yeah AL hasn't implemented that
but afaik `enable_hardware_mouse` was never called
so this path would never have been used before
could be worth looking into this though, is there something wrong with the mouse atm? does it still disappear randomly for software/allegro cursor?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2022 19:30

There is only one tiny difference
before, it could appear partly outside the window border when near the edge of the screen
now, in the same position, it's cut off (obviously, as it's a draw to the screen bitmap)
not a big / important issue I don't think
