I clicked quit instead of end file after dying to the two Manhandlas while testing replays.  When I tried to reopen the replay it crashed on me  Please make sure when someone exits out of ZC you close the replay file or this might happen.  (A110)

can you upload the zplay and qst?

=== @ NightmareJames 10/13/2022 03:36

I'll make a new one that's shorter, yes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2022 03:37

I'm not sure I understand the issue. just to be clear, by "I reopened the replay and it crashed" do you mean it crashes when you select the game on file-select screen, or something else?

OK, I created the replay, then quit out of ZC while in the middle of the quest
Then when I reloaded and tried to play the replay, it crashed

=== @ NightmareJames 10/13/2022 03:39

Basically, you forgot to save/close the file when I quit out I believe, but I may be wrong
Instead of closing the game with F6

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2022 03:42

OK, the issue here is pretty minor.

When you make a new game save, the replay system will write a minimal file with meta data

```
M qst new2013.qst
M sync_rng true
M time_created Wed Oct 12 23:36:34 2022
M time_updated Wed Oct 12 23:36:34 2022
```
And since the replay is only updated on saves, if you quit then this won't be updated at all

=== @ NightmareJames 10/13/2022 03:42

Hrmmmmmmmmmm

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2022 03:42

Trying to replay the above crashes because there are no steps, and the game is expecting a RNG seed during initialization
The fix here is to just never try to play a replay with 0 steps. I'll throw up a dialog error when attempted.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/13/2022 03:43

Let me try with an actual save to make sure it works

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2022 03:43

BTW, to _continue_ a replay you just need to select the game file as normal.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/13/2022 03:44

Sorry, me bad speedrunner.  üòù

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2022 03:44

It's synced to the save file, and will only update the replay file when you really save.
(meta) thread name was changed: ZC crashes when attempting to run replay with no steps

=== @ NightmareJames 10/13/2022 03:46

Hopefully this should be a non-quit case just to verify

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2022 03:47

Yup, that worked perfectly.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/13/2022 03:48

We'll move onto the next quest tomorrow

=== @ NightmareJames 10/13/2022 17:15

Crashed when I appended a second part and played it back

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2022 17:24

Thanks, I'll check it out this evening.

I assume it's a bug related to the replay system from something in this particular quest. I'd expect classic 1st quest to not have this problem for you. Can you verify?
just play a bit, save, reload the game file, play a bit more, save, ... just like this one

=== @ NightmareJames 10/13/2022 17:33

Nope, this one crashed too.  It SHOULD be grab the sword, save, then play Level 1, but crashes before the Level 1 segment

Can you upload your zc.cfg? may be relevant

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/14/2022 00:02

New release ~25m. I think I've worked out the issue here.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/14/2022 00:04

Recording worked when in `-replay-debug` mode, which saves out more steps/comments so is disabled for normal usage. But turns out a certain debug comment is needed on every game over for the "continue recording" part to work

=== @ NightmareJames 10/14/2022 10:29

Hopefully this resolves the crashing issue and we can move onto custom quests and not just the 1st Quest

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/14/2022 18:15

So it worked for you?

=== @ NightmareJames 10/14/2022 18:54

Yes.  Just want you to verify so we can move onto bigger and better quests

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/14/2022 19:01

yup, all good!

=== @ NightmareJames 10/14/2022 19:16

Starting New Quest when I get home
