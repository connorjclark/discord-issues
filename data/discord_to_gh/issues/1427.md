Can we please get a preview box for `Sprite Data`? Living without this is annoying lol. Gotta go back into ZC every time to test if it works correctly

I second this suggestion. It is much needed.

I'd also like this feature.
A workaround I use is making a combo to test the animation, but it's a hassle

The only thing here is, gotta rewrite that dialog in the new system
But, once that's done, adding a preview is trivial

Sweet!
