Not sure how feasible this is, but it would be neat as a thing in either screen data settings, or with zscript.

i'd appreciate a method where you can disable f6 but also keep death continuing

=== @ P-Tux7 09/05/2021 22:07

so that in cases like these if you try to continue you don't press start on the "go back to the file selection" prompt because you think you're gonna be able to continue

ZScript can
make an F6 script
and stuff
don't remember exactly how you'd have to set it up at the moment

oh, also, uh
forgot the simpler way
which is `Input->DisableKeys[]`
so for instance
```cpp
bool b = ScreenFlag(some script screen flag or something);
Input->DisableKeys[KEY_F6] = b;```

zc still has the menu option with the mouse, right?

Oh, true
An F6 script method of handling it would handle that too
