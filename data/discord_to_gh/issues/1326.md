When you play a quest with no custom quest loaded, it says 1st Quest. But this quest is actually the Zelda 1 2nd Quest.

??
It should be 1st
`modules/classic/classic_1st.qst`

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2022 22:40

ok so due to me having replaced a lot of builds and all
let's see if this happens in the next freshly packaged alpha

@ P-Tux7 does it happen in a freshly packed Alpha?
(i forget if we posted 101 after this)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/17/2022 20:50

Latest buildpack; still broken

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/10/2022 16:45

shit.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/10/2022 22:06

no one reported a fix, so yeah

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 22:12

i figured it had been enough builds/long enough/important a bug enough that it was worth me checking

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/11/2022 00:53

hooookay
fun times on this

All module-based quests were being offset by 1
so everything was fucked up
I've done several things here
-Fixed default quest offset
-Fixed skip name offset
-If a module has 0 quests in it, then instead of loading a 1st.qst, no quest will be loaded for that slot upon creation. Trying to load a slot with no quest produces a special error:

-Changing modules should no longer change already-loaded default quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/11/2022 01:23

-When you go to select a custom quest, it will start with the info for the default quest displayed

....without affecting the default path.

Now it just always asks you, and isn't hidden in some random menu.
