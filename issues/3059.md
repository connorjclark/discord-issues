This script from `100_rooms_of_wisdom.qst` produces "Invalid index" errors at runtime:

```c

    }
}
```

... unless you uncomment `// printf("AutomaticFreeformPushblockPuzzle\n");`.
This is the ZASM:

105 is where the error first happens. It says it cant read index 3 of array with length 3.
It's reading the array stored at load offset 6. That should the be length 177 `pushflags`:

```
50: ALLOCATEMEMV    D2              1770000      
51: STORED          D2              60000        
```

But the very next instruction overwrites that allocated array.

```
52: STOREDV         10000           60000        
```

so it's using array index 1 ... which happens to be an array of length 3 ... hence the error.

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) any idea about this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2024 22:21

Nope

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2024 02:27

each is assigned a unique stack position when BasicScope::buildVariable is called

but `decr_stack_recursive` will decrement the scope of the while loop header, which only has a single variable decl (the `i`) which is one more than the stack position of the pushflags global variable. this is during the `analyzeFunctionInternals` "clean up unused vars" step.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2024 02:29

the unused variable it is removing is that `ffc trig = RunFFCScriptOrQuit(scr,trarg);`  at bottom

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2024 02:31

commenting out the `for(auto& pair : func_var_map)` in  `analyzeFunctionInternals` prevents the bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2024 02:48

huh...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2024 02:51

Perhaps this is backwards?

The recompilation of 100 rooms of wisdom works (w/ the workaround printf removed) with this patch.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2024 02:53

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è maybe that's it then
brain isn't in parser mode to help much with this unfortunately

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2024 02:55

It seems reasonable to me, as I expected there be no need to modify the stack positions of scopes where the stack offsets are lower than what is being removed. I think thats what this guard was trying to do.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2024 02:56

that sounds right
