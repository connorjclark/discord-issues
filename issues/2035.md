Setting `Game->Suspend[susptFFCSCRIPTS] = true;` also suspends screen scripts. Tested broken in a110 and a111

Test quest.  This quest has an FFC and Screen script running on 0x00 that continually trace to the console.  When you enter screen 0x01, this runs a different screen script that sets `Game->Suspend[susptFFCSCRIPTS] = true;`
When you return to screen 0x00, both script types have been suspended

I'm not fucking more with suspend....
This is how zoria intended it in his design, however stupid it might seem

=== @ mitchfork 11/19/2022 19:49

How/why? There's a separate constant for screen scripts

is there?
fun
good job zoria
....really, there is?
because I would assume if there is that it just doesn't work at all
oh, it's just in that one spot though
BLEH
I hate this code
