Anyone, who still use NES dungeon Dmap type would want to allow opening NES dungeon shutters on secret trigger, either engine one, or scripted.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) didn't you add this? Or were you planning to? seem to recall something

I would love to freaking have this. especially since getting block puzzle doors to actually stay open is a real pain in the ass

aren't permanent block puzzle secrets a thing now? or does that only apply to secrets and not doors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/09/2021 15:37

secrets
shutters are an *ENTIRELY* separate system
