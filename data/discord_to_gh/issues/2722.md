If you have an array of strings in a script somewhere, and try to access them using DrawString for example, then it'll instead skip over it and draw the next string you have declared. If you don't have another string declared then it draws nothing. My guess is that the memory for the array isn't being allocated or something. Here is my script:
```ffc script Test
{
    void run()
    {
        const int Strings[] = 
        {
            "String1", "String2", "String3", "String4", "String5"
        };

        const int String = "String6";

        while(true)
        {
            for(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
            {
                Screen->DrawString(1, 0, i * 8, FONT_Z1, 0x01, -1, 0, Strings[i], 128);
            }
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
The included image is the in-game result. I'm not sure which version this started on, but I'm using the most recent alpha, and it happens on the most recent nightly too.

(replying to @ Bagel Meister "If you have an array of strin‚Ä¶"): yeah, not a bug, that's not something you can do
arrays of strings can't be made like that
you're using string literals inside arrays
which create a temporary string that stops existing one line later
this is 100% how this is supposed to work, and to change this would require MASSIVE rewrites of basically all of zscript.

I definitely used to be able to do this
I was using A112 before and it worked there
If I want to make something like this, what should I do instead?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 18:49

(replying to @ Bagel Meister "I definitely used to be able‚Ä¶"): no, you did not
this has never once been possible ever
you may have gotten *different errors*, or *random wrong data*, but it did not WORK
what you CAN do, is declare each string first
```cpp
char32[] str1 = "String1";
char32[] str2 = "String2";
char32[] str3 = "String3";
char32[] str4 = "String4";
char32[] str5 = "String5";
char32[] str6 = "String6";```
and then put them together in an array
```cpp
char32[] strings = {str1, str2, str3, str4, str5, str6};```

also btw
declaring an array as `const` does basically nothing
you can still change the stuff INSIDE the array
you just can't overwrite the array pointer... which is something you should never do anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 18:57

(why does it not stop you from changing inside the array? Because ZScript was designed poorly from the start, of course)

=== @ Bagel Meister 10/08/2023 19:01

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "no, you did not"): Yes I did, it was working then I updated ZC then it stopped working
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "what you CAN do, is declare e‚Ä¶"): I'll try that when I get home, thank you
I assume there will be no significant performance hit for doing this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 19:04

(replying to @ Bagel Meister "Yes I did, it was working the‚Ä¶"): I assure you, this has not ever worked
if it SEEMED to work
you were actually just getting random data
and it RANDOMLY happened to be correct

=== @ Bagel Meister 10/08/2023 19:05

It was always right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 19:05

but that random data would change if you edit anything in a script

=== @ Bagel Meister 10/08/2023 19:05

Maybe total coincidence, who knows
Idk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 19:05

yeah
when I say random, it's not like, 100% random
it's random because you can't predict it perfectly because it's based on other scripts and stuff that you are running
but in certain setups it would definitely be reading the right data ***by pure coincidence***

=== @ Bagel Meister 10/08/2023 19:06

That seems unlikely but thanks for the alternative method üëç
