To add a speck of more customization to the Weapon Tab on the Item Editor.
Maybe have it to where triggering properties and enemy defenses are separate.
For example, being able to get the properties of the sword without applying its enemy defense.
Maybe as an item/rule flag that says "Lweapons On Items Don't Affect Defenses".
