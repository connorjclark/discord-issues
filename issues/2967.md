I don't expect this to be applied soon or be of high priority, it would just be much less of a headache for me in the future if the custom weapon itemclasses had a melee option to it similar to the wand.

everything to do with melee is AWFUL and JANK

i agree

(theres a reason the bug net doesnt hit enemies)
(didnt want to deal with the melee code more than I had to lol)

=== @ Attempt 01/08/2024 17:43

fair, tbh i don't even need it to hit enemies, just a "shooty" lookin thing just so that link isn't barfing random things outta nowhere lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/08/2024 17:44

ah, just looking for a separate stab sprite thing?

=== @ Attempt 01/08/2024 17:45

ye

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/08/2024 17:45

interesting
(I make no comment on feasability/likelyhood of this idea, especailly since I'm not touching coding for a t least a few days)

=== @ Attempt 01/08/2024 17:45

i've gotten pretty far scripting one, but it all goes downhill when it comes to tracking the player's movement while in the air

ah, that's what that other convo was about
might be able to help with that too

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "(I make no comment on feasabi…"): understandable
just something to hopefully see in the distant future
