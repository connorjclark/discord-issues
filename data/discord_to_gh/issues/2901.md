given: this only seems to work shortly after ive been using the program awhile. not sure what tirggers it.
attatched are scree shots of a 2x2 placed tile.  it might be after doing a goto warp thing, or it might be after i tested the quest. all i know is it stops  working at some point after i play around with the editor.

toggle combo column mode (spacebar)

It's possible this is a draw setting that gets toggled by a hotkey, I've had this happen too. I don't recall what the hotkey was or where it displays this possible alternate drawing mode. Even if this is not a bug, it's not very apparent the drawing mode has changed, and could be made a little more obvious.

yeah this should be changed
it's weird
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "toggle combo column mode (spa…"): ^ but not a *bug* at least
just a zc weirdness
