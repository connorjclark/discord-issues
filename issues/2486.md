If you try and put a sound effect on a Dive warp even in a fresh quest it causes the player to drown even if they have the flippers

*sigh*
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) looks like your water stuff is reading attributes from Dive Warps as though it is Liquid, which, they do NOT have the same attributes
(The Sound is Attribyte 1... which on Liquid combos is the `Flipper Level` requirement.)

sigh...
honestly I'd QR dive warps to use the same attribute layout as liquid
I did a similar thing with shallow water I believe
having them line up is both easier code-wise and allows users to switch types/copy more easily
