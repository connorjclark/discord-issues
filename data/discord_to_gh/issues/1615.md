```
Tall Grass (Continuous)
Identical to Tall Grass, but if slashing this combo changes it to another slash-affected combo, then that combo will also change.
```
Instead it uses the screen's undercombo and does not apply the Continuous property to it.

...is this a new bug, or?
Technically, in that is says `Identical to Tall Grass`, that does use undercombo, and things that use undercombo.... can't really be continuous as they would be infinite loops of instant crash, this is behaving exactly as that documentation says it should
but, obviously that isn't what's intended....

Gonna need to know how old this bug is in order to fix it
because if it was in 2.50.2 it definitely will need a qr
