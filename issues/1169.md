these flags appear to be wrong
`ENEMY_FLAG1` is being checked for `Attributes 13`, despite that being flag 2 in the editor

and this is the special flags for Ganon
which.... ***all of the related code for this flag is commented out and does not exist in builds***
What the fucking hell
This needs to be fixed, and the flag for amulet 2+ showing ganon needs to be implemented+checked by default

does enemy is completely invisible cloak them or just plain not draw them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:24

should be not draw

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:43

mm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2021 23:05

Okay, but how would it make him visible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/19/2021 23:05

great question

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2021 23:05

Reminder that ganons tile chanes every frame to a random tile

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/19/2021 23:05

perhaps check the commented out code to see if there was an idea there
if not, perhaps come up with something new

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2021 23:05

Just showing ganon all the time is a lazy copout
Maybe he shows every x frames?
You get a better gist of where he is, but not a perfect one

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 00:29

cloaked ganon?
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Reminder that ganons tile cha‚Ä¶"): oh yeah, more ganon bs
zelda classic has 5 frames
but zelda 1 seems to have him go through *6* frames in order, one per frame, and the one displayed when you hurt him is said frame that he's currently on
it's a little hard for me to tell if the 6th frame is a real thing or not because i've only seen it using the Buffet speedrun test rom's visible ganon option... not on unmodified Z1

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 00:33

also i wasn't sure whether to say this the other day
and keep in mind i think it was through the zoria or tamamo grapevine
but i heard there were meant to be two "classes" of invisible enemies
1. cloaked
2. invisible (1.90, 2.50 enemy is completely invsible)
amulet 1 makes cloaked enemies visible and invisible enemies cloaked
amulet 2 makes all enemies visible
i, as said before, was unsure to mention this
because i am not sure if it was ever an intended idea
and to be frank, completely invisible enemies as a gameplay mechanic are awful and should not have dev time spent on them
(though rendering cloaked enemies as invisible DOES need to be added for 1.90 compatibility, I'll go post in that thread and remind myself to check if their projectiles are invisible too tomorrow)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 01:38

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "and to be frank, completely i‚Ä¶"): Didnt stop zoria from wasting attributes on that exact feature

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 01:40

i thought enemy was completely invisible was a 2.50.2 thing
or did he add more

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 19:31

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "zelda classic has 5 frames"): oh duh i'm an idiot
does it have him have 6 frames and the 6th is just a flipped version of one of the others
like so many pre-new enemy tiles things worked

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 20:14

ye

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 20:21

whew

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:39

i think the best way to handle this would have settings in the amulet 2 item itself
1. How Often To Show Ganon
2. How Long Each Showing Lasts
and it might need a bit of touchup with the ganon animation code so every appearance of ganon isn't animating and stays on one static frame
...or you could just have the "appearances" be their own decoration/sparkle, spawned where ganon is, and have them NOT move with him

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:42

i could PROBABLY rustle up 4-way walking Ganon sprites (not in time for the alpha but for the tileset) but i have no idea how you'd set the animation for those
(they'd use the "special" tile or just be on the row below Z1 Ganon)
okay so, kooky idea, but QR where a Ganon enemy is hardcoded to use the Ganon animation while invisible, and uses the user-defined one while visible

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:46

or enemy flag, whatever, and make all quests in the player below A100 (or A101) turn that flag off

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:52

maybe yeah

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 00:40

oh and the first z1 frame should probably always be used for when he's hurt while visible

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 21:22

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) #1221 had a great idea for what an amulet 2 can do to modern ganon

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/21/2021 21:24

yeah?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 21:24

the thing at the bottom
where you can see him once every (x) teleports

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/21/2021 21:25

ahhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2022 02:42

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) @ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:43

yes?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:44

Can you test to see if Ganon and enemies work with invisibility options and havign specific items toggle visibility for enemies?
I think it works, but I lack self confidence

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2022 02:45

<a:hugheart:876927396215930930>

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:45

in the buildpack?
sure

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:48

yeah

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:53

also while we're at it i was modifying ganon and
flags -> behaviour -> use editor???
and "death shot item ID"?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:54

Death shot item ID is, I think, an attempt to have silver arrows but for any item type?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:54

i'll try it out later in #1187

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:56

oh and uh, one last thing, how do i set enemies to be invisible (the kind that can be dispelled)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:56

Oh, @ P-Tux7 don't bother

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:56

i thought you could make enemies individually invisible and not just the screen flag

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:56

it's not implemented
entire code is commented out and does nothing

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:56

well that's handy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:56

lmfao
the ganon deaht shot and use editor stuff, I mean

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:57

yeah i would have thought it'd be Lweapon type + Lweapon level instead of just one number to enter

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:57

Use Editor is supposed to let you define custom defense values for ganon
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i thought you could make enem‚Ä¶"): Should be one of the 3 flag tabs of the enemy editor

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:57

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Use Editor is supposed to let‚Ä¶"): ok that'd admittedly be neat but i don't have any plans in mind for it right now
oh so i want "enemy is completely invisible" + "draw enemy as cloaked" to simulate the screen flag effect?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:59

I think so, yeah
Draw Invisible as Cloaked

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:59

it works!!!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:59

woo!

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:59

there are two enemies on the screen - an octorok and ganon
use the l4 cheat (4) to give yourself an l2 bracelet to see the octorok, and an l3 bracelet to see ganon
