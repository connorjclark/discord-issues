It seems when I set up a button prompt, it either doesn't pick up the item and shows the prompt, or breaks the combo instantly without picking ut up.
this is breaking the item immediately

So because of this I naturally can't add a button prompt to my combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 22:59

ah, because the combo trigger is using the button

=== @ Jared 05/11/2023 23:00

Oh that makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:00

It might work fine if you just set `Buttons: 0`
maybe

=== @ Jared 05/11/2023 23:00

I tried that, it didn't work lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:00

what happens then

=== @ Jared 05/11/2023 23:00

That just makes it be liftable normally but without the prompt

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:01

ahk, so the prompt is not shown if no button is set
that seems like something I can fix easily

=== @ Jared 05/11/2023 23:01

Awesome

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:03

The button that is set in triggers being eaten, I can't fix- but allowing button of 0 to show a prompt is easy
The way the lift works is, it only allows that button to lift if nothing else has eaten the input already
(that's how most engine `->Press` behaviors work, actually)

=== @ Jared 05/11/2023 23:04

Ahhh okay. That makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:04

(which is why if the lift button and sword button are the same, you don't swing your sword when lifting- because the lift occurs first, eating the input)

=== @ Jared 05/11/2023 23:04

I'm glad it's fixable at least
Makes sense!
I plan on making the lift input permanently on the L button, but I haven't gotten to that yet
I need a script for it I think

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:05

? why do you need a script?

=== @ Jared 05/11/2023 23:05

I want it permanently on it
Is there a way to do that in-engine now??

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:06

...there has been since lifting was added
the Lift Glove item has a `Button:` field
just set that to `4` (it works the same as the other values, and its' `?` button has the values)

tf
Thank you so much

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:06

the roc's feather also has this now
for jump buttons
In fact, I'm curious- if you change the lift glove to use this, do the prompts work again?
(It uses a different timing, so, it may make a difference)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:09

also, you can try this (drop into the latest nightly)
this should allow `Button: 0` on the triggers tab to still display a prompt

=== @ Jared 05/11/2023 23:11

I'm gonna try
I just need zelda exe?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:15

that's the only file I changed, nothing else changed since the latest nightly

=== @ Jared 05/11/2023 23:17

Ah okay
Can I just replace the current nightly with it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:24

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "also, you can try this (drop…"): ^That would be what I said to do lol

=== @ Jared 05/11/2023 23:32

Ah lol fail
