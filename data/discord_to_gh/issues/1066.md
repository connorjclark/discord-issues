I don't think they are meant to?
Normally they flash csets, IIRC

(Not home to check code rn)

=== @ Guinevere 10/01/2021 07:17

but the funny thing is that they are spaced like they can

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/01/2021 07:18

I mean yeah, hardcoded sprite shit is janky af

=== @ Guinevere 10/01/2021 07:19

@ DeletedUser Try setting `Miscellaneous Type` to `3` on the sword sprite....

=== @ Guinevere 10/04/2021 11:45

that works
the flickering is a lil weird
but i'll take it
thank ya

peeked at the beam break effect
and saw
```cpp
if ( do_animation ) 
{
    if(type2==3 && (f&2))
        ++tile;
}
```

=== @ Guinevere 10/04/2021 11:46

huh

=== @ Guinevere 10/04/2021 11:48

misc. types in the sprite editor were kinda iffy to figure out so i never messed with them too much

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 11:48

specifically,
```cpp
case wBeam:
case wRefBeam:
{
    if(dead==-1) break;
    
    // draw the beam shards
    int ofs=23-dead;
    int f = frame&3;
    int type2 = o_type;
    //tile = o_tile+((frames?frames:1)*2);
    update_weapon_frame(((frames?frames:1)*2),o_tile);
    
    if(type2)
        cs = o_cset>>4;
    if ( do_animation ) 
    {
        if(type2==3 && (f&2))
            ++tile;
    }
    if(!type2 || f==0 || (type2>1 && f==3)) overtile16(dest,tile,x-2-ofs,y+playing_field_offset-2-ofs-(z+zofs),cs,0);
    
    if(!type2 || f==2 || (type2>1 && f==1)) overtile16(dest,tile,x+2+ofs,y+playing_field_offset-2-ofs-(z+zofs),cs,1);
    
    if(!type2 || f==1 || (type2>1 && f==2)) overtile16(dest,tile,x-2-ofs,y+playing_field_offset+2+ofs-(z+zofs),cs,2);
    
    if(!type2 || f==3 || (type2>1 && f==0)) overtile16(dest,tile,x+2+ofs,y+playing_field_offset+2+ofs-(z+zofs),cs,3);
}
```
that's the entire code block for beam shards

i see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 11:52

anyway, this appears to be working as intended
(meta) thread name was changed: ❌🔒Beam Break effects does not animate

=== @ Guinevere 10/04/2021 11:53

ye
guess i should make a feature request where there is a misc type where it animates the beam shards without them flickering.
