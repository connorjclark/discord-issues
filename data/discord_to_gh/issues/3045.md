and also does not mute when at 0 volume

this happens for screen data:
- ambient sound
- boss roar sound

3.0 Prerelease 35

got distracted looking into this as I noticed the title music would play after exiting sound menu
which led me to finding that zcmusic_stop doesnt actually set the "stop" state for half the formats
which meant for those formats, "stop" was just "pause" and then if the volume were set again it would resume.
it was ogg and mp3

commit c3f7ec46fd72b3cf3f712528cd2ec0df231cd25e (HEAD -> main)

    fix(zc): actually stop mp3/ogg, and explicitly stop title music
    
    The titlescreen music would restart in the file select screen if the
    Sound dialog was opened then closed. This was because the volume was set
    to 0 to fade out, but it was never actually stopped.
    
    But also, due to a bug ogg and mp3 formats were really just "paused"
    when told to stop, so setting the volume afterwards would result in
    resuming music that was meant to be over.

lol ambient sound is called `oceansfx`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/06/2024 04:54

this volume was never set
it must have implicitly relied on `digi_music`, which was removed and set to max

=== @ tim 02/06/2024 04:55

yeah there's a whole bunch of ambients
you can even set like stairs and it does it still

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/06/2024 05:01

so we have code to modify the volume of already playing sfx
spot the bug
```c
//allegro assertion fails when passing in -1 as voice -DD
if(sfx_voice[i] > 0)
    voice_set_volume(sfx_voice[i], temp_volume);
```
ambient sound is typically the first sfx loaded so... it gets voice 0

oof
also apparently the first beep of low life is on ambient
it silenced after the first beep
