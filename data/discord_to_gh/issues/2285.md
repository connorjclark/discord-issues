If WARP_FLAG_PLAYMUSIC is on, the current playing music will always override the new DMap's and keep playing. If it's off, it will always reset even if warping to the same DMap or one with the same music. Both of these behaviors could be situationally useful but neither is what I'd expect out of a normal warp

pretty sure that flag is not supposed to override anything
it's supposed to do what you want

In addition to the playmusic thing I'm pretty sure there's more that's fucky with this function
```        // Does an insta warp with WarpEx
        void InstaWarp(int type, int dmap, int scrn, int returnPoint)
        {
            int flags = WARP_FLAG_SCRIPTDRAW|WARP_FLAG_PLAYSOUNDS;
            if(SameMusic(dmap))
                flags |= WARP_FLAG_PLAYMUSIC;
            switch(type)
            {
                case WT_IWARP:
                    Link->WarpEx({WT_IWARP, dmap, scrn, -1, returnPoint, WARPFX_INSTANT, 0, flags});
                    break;
                case WT_IWARPBLACKOUT:
                    Link->WarpEx({WT_IWARPBLACKOUT, dmap, scrn, -1, returnPoint, WARPFX_BLACKOUT, 0, flags});
                    break;
                case WT_IWARPWAVE:
                    Link->WarpEx({WT_IWARPWAVE, dmap, scrn, -1, returnPoint, WARPFX_WAVE, 0, flags});
                    break;
                case WT_IWARPZAP:
                    Link->WarpEx({WT_IWARPZAP, dmap, scrn, -1, returnPoint, WARPFX_ZAP, 0, flags});
                    break;
                case WT_ENTRANCEEXIT:
                case WT_IWARPOPENWIPE:
                    Link->WarpEx({WT_ENTRANCEEXIT, dmap, scrn, -1, returnPoint, WARPFX_OPEN, 0, flags});
                    break;
            }
        }```

Wrote a function to try and reproduce each of the standard warp types and they do not feel right. Wavy plays twice, opening wipe also seems to play twice. Playing twice is the theme. I'd suspect WARPFX as the culprit but when I had that off they all behaved like instant warp

(replying to @ Moosh "If WARP_FLAG_PLAYMUSIC is on,…"): ....this is a fairly old report, but uh, mind checking if this is fixed? I did shit with this like a couple weeks back- WARP_FLAG constants changed, and there's a compat rule.
