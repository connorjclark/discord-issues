The idea is that in addition to being able to use the trigger tab in the combo editor to set different item triggers, you can set whether or not triggering this combo has a chance for items to drop, similar to tall grass or bushes. Enabling item drops also allows the user to specify what item drop set the combo will reference when triggered, with tall grass (12) being the default value.

An additional idea is that the user can specify if the combo spawns sprites and their visual behaviors when triggered like cut tall grass or leaves from cut bushes, flower pedals, or entirely custom sprites that behave like cut bush leaves.

This can make it possible to have pots in boss rooms guarantee heart/ammo drops, like in the mainline Zelda games or bombable rocks that happen to also drop items, as a ZC approximation to something like the ore veins in Breath of the Wild.

there are enough combos that have this capability
if we keep adding everything like this, we'll end up where you can have any combo be doing any thing, which will both be an absolute mess of code, as well as a lot of redundancies

Even just the ability to change what item drop set a slashable combo uses? I can't think of many redundancies arising from that, at least visible on the user's end.

you already can do that on bush and such combos

huh TIL
I'm not used to a lot of the new features in 2.55 since the majority of my experience has been with 2.10 and 2.50

it is best to poke at the editor to see if something exists before requesting it

I did and didn't notice that specifically for whatever reason
