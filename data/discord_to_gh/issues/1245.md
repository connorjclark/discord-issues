Combo type that uses the Triggers tab to select weapons that die when they touch it. Similar idea to `Block All`, but configurable to specific things. @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?

Yeah, I'll look into this

mayhaps a flag on the block all combo ITSELF to respect checked/unchecked weapon types instead of a new combo
so we don't add an unnecessary combo type

...or a "kills weapons" trigger flag, which would then work alongside the others
Then even a none combo could block stuff
Or, say, have a pound combo that blocks arrows
