Trigger self flag works fine, but the intended conjoint with the screen flags Hit All Triggers -> Perm Secret / 16-31 does not
I was confused why it did not act as expected
-> Perm Secret works
it sets the secret state, so if you leave and re-enter the screen the secret is triggered
16-31 *does not* proceed
...unless Enemies->Secret is Permanenet is also checked
which seems like it should have absolutely nothing to do with it.
This has been the behaviour in ZC for a while, I believe. Since I recall it being a pain to set up before.
But it *feels* like it's unintended to work like this.

fucks sake
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) any chance you have magic to work here?

I'm guessing some dumbass typo'd the wrong QR somewhere
it'd be an easy fix

prooobably my fault somewhere
but I have no energy at all after having my blood drawn this morning

I don't think this is high priority, few people use this setting.
I just wanted to fill a report
