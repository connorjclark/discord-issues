Add more `*W_SCRIPT#` types

Err...what wpn types?
Oh, just 10 or so more script types?
ONLY REASON I DID NOT DO THIS
Needs more guidance enemy editor defences

If you added those too, fine, but don't forget them and the combo trigger stuff for them, and adding script support for them
I wanted to increase them to 20 by beta 1
But no more than 20
That was my sane limit
As we still need proper wpns
And ewpns start at 128
So max lw is 127
And there are 20+ lwpns to finish

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 17:51

Max wpn I'd should never exceed 255 imo
127 loans and 127  ewpns should suffice
Script wpns iirc are in their own bounds
Some weird block

aye, script weapons are shared
as `LW_SCRIPT1 == EW_SCRIPT1`
