finding all kinds of charging/spinning bugs lol
when charging the spin attack, if you fall down the pit, the charging sword will spawn back with link but not follow him after

2.55 or 3.0?

=== @ Attempt 01/07/2024 20:37

2.55
might be 3.0 too
dunno there
(meta) thread name was changed: Pitfall Bug while Charging (2.55 Latest Nightly)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 20:38

link is frazzled after blipping through reality
forgive him if he drops something

=== @ Attempt 01/07/2024 20:38

fair fair

=== @ Attempt 01/07/2024 20:42

also seems to make you spawn where you started charging instead of the nearest/last "safe ground" combo you were on

=== @ Attempt 01/07/2024 20:44

dunno if that's intentional or not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/08/2024 00:24

(replying to @ Attempt "also seems to make you spawn…"): You are only "safe" while you are in the walking or none action states
So, while charging, it doesn't consider you safe...
I would say "not a bug, but could be changed to fix it anyway if it seems better"

=== @ Attempt 01/08/2024 00:25

don't mind either way

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/09/2024 03:31

happens at least as far back at A108

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/09/2024 03:32

changing this to low prio b/c it's only visual, and only if you continue holding down the sword btn as you repsawn

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/09/2024 03:42

...does drowning have the same issue?
I would think not, but the code for falling and drowning are so similar...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/09/2024 03:43

...in fact, there's only one thing that stands out as a difference, so if it doesn't happen for drowning...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/09/2024 03:44

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) this might fix it?

I don't have my pc only my laptop which isnt set up to compile or anything
so, can't actually test myself atm, but that's the only big difference I see between drowning and falling
(this would need a replay version check, as this is *giving you iframes after respawning from a fall*, which apparently isn't happening)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/09/2024 04:02

didn't fix it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/09/2024 04:04

does it happen when drowning as well then?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/09/2024 07:50

this used to happen if a script set link's direction while charging

=== @ Attempt 01/10/2024 03:02

guess it's not a *big* deal
i could probably script a way to end the charging while falling in the meantime
