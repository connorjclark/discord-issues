Opening this for @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) – I left a comment in that function with a possible direction, but you probably can assess quickly what/if anything else needs to change to make sure that the function cannot overflow even if the passed in strings that are not nul-terminated.
Also, ToN has a version string that is `Beta2.0.0`–should such a version string be supported by ZQ?

Fixed, and expanded the character limit on both fields. The fields are now null-terminated, max 16 chars with a `[17]` array.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Also, ToN has a version strin…"): Hmm... how would ZC even compare an alphabetic string like this to see which one is "lesser" in Min. Version? I ought to test this tonight to see if it crashes ZC

That's what I'm asking. Ideally we used something well-defined like semver, which can handle things like this.
But I'm wondering how much this feature is even used
In semver, the "beta" bit would be the pre-release tag: `2.0.0-beta` for example
anything after `-` is compared component by component, numerically if possible but if not, just lexically. so like `2.0.0-beta.2.3` is possible
This is a clearly useful thing for software dependency management, but overkill for whatever this versioning feature is trying to support in ZQ.
It is, however, better to use a standard than make one up that doesn't support all possible use cases.
But if a strictly non-decreasing integer would suffice for the use case here (can someone explain it?), that is better than a string field.
Is it just to capture when global data in scripts needed to change?

It's always seemed a bit overkill to me, but it's so you can do like
-1.0.0
-1.0.1 - compatible with 1.0.0 savegames - min. version is 1.0.0
-1.0.2 - not compatible with 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 savegames - min version is 1.0.2

so when you update your quest and someone tries to use an old save file to continue their old game in the new quest version (because zc connects savegames to .qst filenames, so if the new .qst version is named the same as the old version or the user manually renames it to be the same), you can choose to allow it or for zc to forbid it and tell them that they have to start over

That isn't consistent - did you make a typo in your example somewhere?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/05/2023 19:57

oh i forgot to say - zc also embeds the version of the .qst in the save file
so that's how it knows that it shouldn't load a save file tagged 1.0.1 when the .qst's Min. Version says 1.0.2
