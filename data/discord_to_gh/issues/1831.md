So I basically have two instances of zc.sav, one named zc_play.sav (this file is for when I want to play other quests and it's in a "saves" folders I made) and zc.sav (I use the later to test Myriad Worlds in the actual ZC Player from start to finish) and when I tell ZC Launcher to load zc_play.sav for save files it basically ignores it and defaults back to loading zc.sav for save files. This problem didn't exist a month or so ago.

`and it's in a "saves" folders I made`
did you direct it to the folder properly?
oh, wait, it's not typed in, it's a browser
huh

....the launcher is setting the config properly
ZC just appears to be resetting the config

I.... this is a tangled mess of a poorly implemented feature... I don't have the energy to dig into this right now
(you can take one guess who's feature this was....)
