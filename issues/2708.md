the init data isn't carrying across to updated versions of ZQ. 

included my copy of zquest.cfg for reference. zquest.cfg appears to have made two copies of test data for the same quest file so i'm guessing it's trying to pull the init data from the *second* version of `swords\TC_sub_build.qst`

specficially this bit, where it's made the second version using a slash instead of a backslash

This was  due to a change in how it was implemented, it was to fix a bug involving invalid characters

Will remember to code in a data migration if I need to change this again!
