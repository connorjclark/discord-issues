Okay so...Zoria wrote several scripts when he added this feature making use of it and demonstrating its potential for Z3 scrolling collisions, yeah? Ergo he used the feature. Ergo he knew he forgot the *10000 and just didn't give a shit. Really gets your noggin a joggin
(meta) thread name was changed: GetPixel() not *10000
