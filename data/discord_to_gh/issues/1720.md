I'm not sure what the exact issue is. TBH

was just scrolling through init data stuff
and the program is now just completely unresponsive to input

only thing I can think of is that the quest used to have the "classic header" script crap imported and configured, but I got rid of it for my own script file
so there are a lot of items here that lack their scripts but are still set up equipment
which I assume this scroll: half magic is

I wouldn't see why that would crash anything
the only things that menu reads from items
is their itemclass, name, and `Equipment Item` checkbox
and `Level`, I think, for sorting reasons?
but it shouldn't even be aware of anything else
