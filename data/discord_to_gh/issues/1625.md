When writing to lweapon->Level with a script, enemies damaged by power 0 weapons do not take damage equal to `Level * 2` like I would expect. Instead they take 1 damage. I'm able to write to the value and read the correct result, so it's not read only, the damage calculations just don't seem to care.

Same deal if I modify level on an instance of an existing item such as magic boomerang, it will continue to deal whatever damage it's set to in the editor.
