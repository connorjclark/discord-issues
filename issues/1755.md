In my quests, i usually use SNES music, as ZC supports the SPC format for music. For a quest i'm working on now, I have this really short song for boss fights. I noticed during testing that the song doesn't loop at all. I dont know if other songs do this, but this seems to be a recent problem. I checked earlier builds, and it seems that the first build to have this problem is the first x64 build.
If it helps, i can post the song used if you want
I have to sleep now, sorry if i can't get back about this for a little

Yeah the file would help

Just double checked that at least an nsf song loops (uses same library as spc)
Well, I also only checked ZQ music player

You see it in ZQ too?

Hi, sorry it took me so long to respond, ive been on trains all day. This is the song i used. Also, i only listened to it in ZC itself

the issue still seems to be there in the latest build btw

=== @ Bagel Meister 07/21/2022 19:14

Sorry if i'm pestering you, but what's the situation on this issue? Can it be reproduced with the song i sent? For me it happens at about 45 seconds, where the SPC starts to fade out when played normally.

No update haven't looked yet

Might look tonight

=== @ Bagel Meister 07/21/2022 19:15

Thanks üëç

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/21/2022 19:16

Please check in ZQ too
In the play music menu

=== @ Bagel Meister 07/21/2022 19:18

For me it cuts out in ZQ as well

=== @ Bagel Meister 07/27/2022 20:25

Hi, I've been testing more songs using the ZQ music player. It seems like every SPC i play cuts out at the point it's supposed to loop, not just this one song
But as you said previously, no NES song i can find has this problem at all
weird

Sorry to reopen the thread, but can somebody take a look at this issue? All the music in my quest is SPC, so this bug means none of the music in my quest loops

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/05/2022 19:53

No need to apologize, also no need to bump. I Only plan to work on z3 scrolling until I have basic demo up

=== @ Bagel Meister 08/05/2022 19:54

Thanks for the update
