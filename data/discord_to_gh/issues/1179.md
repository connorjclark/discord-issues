1. https://www.armageddongames.net/showthread.php?97729-Controllable-jump-height
Like this, or as seen scripted in Alucard648's sideview engine
This immediately triggers what happens when you reach the peak of the jump (i.e. you slowly decelerate and then fall)
2. a "usable only once per screen" flag

Smart idea, though may be quite hard to implement
gotta track that you hold the button, and that it was a roc's feather button, so a bunch of global work there

This has been in the back of my mind cause it's one of the few things preventing ZC from being really sideview friendly
but I don't know how the math or shit would work lmao

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:01

both zoria and alucard (or grayswandir?) implemented it in script... see how they did it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:01

A script for it could be pretty simple
so, aye

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:02

alucard's played pretty well for what i remembered

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:02

to do it in engine though would be much harder
a script can just have a local variable that stays between frames
the engine can't
anything in-engine would need to be handled globally with all sorts of checks

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:02

in the classic tileset i am putting somewhere "ptux's recommended scripts to import"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:02

to remember 1. what button it was 2. that there was a jump button etc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 07:02

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "to do it in engine though wou…"): aka don't expect it unless Dimi chugs a ton of caffeine and beer and decides to toss her sanity out the window for the 5th time in a month

sorry
i can certainly keep the TILESET script free but i'd like to be allowed to recommend the importation of scripts to users
if that's not a problem

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 07:04

That's not an outright no to having it in-engine though. Just, it may happen but it depends entirely on when I feel like learning mario math.
@ P-Tux7 does SMB have variable jumping? If so, do you know of a decomp of it?
might be helpful.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:05

ahahahahaha
mario 1 has so many
just google it
zelda 1 also has a very well-commented one
i haven't ever linked them here for legal reasons but they're so easy to find

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 07:05

Zelda 1's decomp is a very useful tool that I have yet to start looking at

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:17

y'know. "once per screen" might be a good one too
