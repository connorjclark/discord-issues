Extra item flags for being able to hover over liquid, and flag for combos similar to `Hookshot/Ladder Only` where you can only walk through the solid combo with hover boots one way. As well as adding respective new general flags so all combos _could_ be hookshot/switchhook/ladder/hover boots over if solid

"One way"?

=== @ vlamart 11/02/2022 20:52

Like walking off an edge

Perhaps a transparent, time sensitive ladder could do the same?

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) would probably be the one to handle anything to do with water
`Hookshot/Ladder Only` combos sound like they would be pretty problematic, because, what happens when the boots run out? You just get softlocked in the middle of solid combos?
water could work similar to how pits work though

Hmm maybe force hover until not solid? Then it's the onus on the creator to not softlock that 🤔

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 01:23

....so just infinite hover?
How about you just make the combos `Automatically Triggered` with an item requirement of `Hover Boots` and turn into the next combo which is nonsolid but has `No Ground Enemies` flag?
wouldn't have the hover effect I guess but like
....I'm frankly not fucking with letting the player just walk through solid combos arbitrarily
that sounds like a recipe for disaster

Fair enough. My other idea to emulate jumping off edges would be a "trampoline" combo type, that would work like `step->jump` if not solid, and `push->jump` if solid. But then yeah, same problem with softlocking maybe...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 01:30

Anything that lets you through solids will not be added in-engine
at least not this version

=== @ vlamart 11/05/2022 01:31

Again, fair enough
