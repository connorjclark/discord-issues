I feel like I've requested this before and there was a reason it wasn't possible. Apologies for dredging it up again if that's the case. Anyways, for teleportation logic I'm looking to detect whether a non edge based region is solid or not to an enemy with respect to its Move Flags in the enemy editor. I could probably accomplish this with a combination of repositioning the enemy and CanMoveXY() calls, but that would be really ugly and gross and jank. There's gotta be a better way. 

If it's too much hassle I can write the logic I need for this in ZScript but I wanted to double check first.

`npc->CanExist(x,y)`? "can the npc exist at this position"

=== @ Moosh 04/13/2023 23:59

might also add w and h for variable size

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 00:01

say I'm checking if the enemy can transform and resize into a position, or if I'm doing a collision check for something that isn't the main body

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 00:03

Another reason I specified a pixel check is line projection collisions. Say I'm checking every pixel along a line to check if the enemy can see Link

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 00:04

That's a common example I use where the hitbox is not a traditional rectangle

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 09:47

....fun times, pretty sure MoveXY ignores solid ffcs!

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 09:50

What a coincidence. When posed with the question of "Should I script interaction with these?" I, too concluded "Fuck no" 😛

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 10:03

The thing is engine movement doesn't ignore it
...most things all end up calling the same one function, and we put the interaction in that function
just forgot that movexy doesn't use that at all
Oh, also, apparently we already have an internal function `scr_canplace`. Which appears to be EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT.
...and is apparently... used as part of scripted knockback?
interesting
Anyway, enemies that are stopped by solids should be stopped by solid ffcs now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 10:07

This also means enemies will be stopped by solid enemies (which we do have the internal code for, just no access for it yet)
with the fun internal handling that it does not get stopped by *itself* if it is solid.
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Oh, also, apparently we alrea…"): err, minus the width/height transformation, but that's something I can handle easily enough

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 10:10

(just change the width/height, call that function, revert the width/height, return)

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 10:16

Yeah that works. Takes care of 90% of all situations. And I'm working on my own function which I can use for line collisions
Also interacting with solid FFCs sounds kinda hype, though I'm unlikely to write enemies that'll be interacting with solids

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 10:17

Them not interacting with them would have been a bug, just, no one reported it before I found it myself just now
I don't think I have the energy to add new script functions right now, but, the internal side of this is all set up, so it'll be simple enough to finish up later.
It'll be
```cpp
bool npc->CanPlace(int x, int y, int special = SPW_NONE, bool kb = false, int wid = -1, int hei = -1);```
leaving wid/hei at `-1` uses the current width/height, thus them being optional params at the end

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 10:21

`kb` is 'knockback', which matters for a particular circumstance; enemies that can fall into pits that will not VOLUNTARILY walk into pits and kill themselves. They will find pits as non-walkable if `kb = false`, but pits perfectly fine if `kb = true`, as you can knock these enemies back into pits.

Use case for this I suppose would be, you wouldn't want to spawn enemies into pits, so `kb = false`- but if you gave a player a weapon that teleports an enemy it hits in a direction, you probably want that to be able to throw the enemy into pits, so `kb = true`.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 10:25

(replying to @ Moosh "Also interacting with solid F…"): I could use a test of the fix, if you wouldn't mind- when the next nightly goes up, which won't be right now.

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 10:34

Sure thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 11:15

(replying to @ Moosh "Sure thing"): #deleted-channel
(no rush at all, I'm taking a break for a while)

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 11:27

Seems to be working, though one quirk I noticed that also affects regular solid FFCs...
The screen flag "FF Combos Wrap Around" will cause objects in the FFC's path to teleport when the FFC does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 11:32

...whaa?

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 11:33

oh
thassa notta good
I went to replicate the behavior on video and found something wrose

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096094917597593730/1097122707641991338/2023-04-16_07-33-08.mp4?ex=65e46025&is=65d1eb25&hm=5be6436d1640f617ea6e77cabae8e14d5512b1f89b500081e092d1e8d45836df&)
that appears to be a hang
It's reproducible too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 11:37

oh fun

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 11:38

a bit less major is this one which shows enemies colliding with a stationary block from the top get clipped to the left when it starts moving
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096094917597593730/1097123782088478821/2023-04-16_07-36-28.mp4?ex=65e46125&is=65d1ec25&hm=291df1d81168be7c2be1d155b9b8bc80f5ff4c0c119ef5abc8961ae12f1f3e3a&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 11:38

huh....
I don't remember how much of the solid pushing stuff was mine and how much was @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
either way, taking a break. This can be tomorrow's problem.

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 11:39

Oh yeah for sure, I'm just getting into the nitpicks here. Feature says "experimental" for a reason
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096094917597593730/1097124153028521984/2023-04-16_07-38-56.mp4?ex=65e4617d&is=65d1ec7d&hm=217ff2e4b68c5ca9a17ef0c4dacc7923572197db09848b3d5ef3f3287389da08&)
Anyways, this one shows an inconsistency between how Link interacts with two opposite forces and how the enemy does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 11:40

(replying to @ Moosh "Oh yeah for sure, I'm just ge…"): odd
anyway uhhh
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
let's make sure that doesn't get buried lol

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 11:40

For the case of the feature I was supposed to be testing here "Do they avoid solids" it'd appear they do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 11:41

good
like, before this build, I'd expect them to have walked right through stationary solids
(moving solids probably would still have pushed them)

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 11:43

actually shoot
I spoke too soon

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 11:44

Seems like it might be the thing I noticed where it was pushing to the left, it clips a little into the top and left edges
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096094917597593730/1097125422686273637/2023-04-16_07-43-24.mp4?ex=65e462ac&is=65d1edac&hm=3cc86011d2d1eb4381925a4a996e3b812b0521219a46260b58e0b57a6c73a141&)

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 11:45

Yes indeed that clip doesn't happen on the south edge of the moving block. So probably a subpixel thing?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 11:46

note to self: make sure collide_object uses zfix for wid/hei

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 23:18

```
bool CanPlace(float nx, float ny, int special = SPW_NONE,
    bool knockback = false, int nw = -1, int nh = -1);
 * Checks if the enemy could be arbitrarily placed (teleported) at 'nx,ny'.
 * If 'nw' or 'nh' are > -1, they will be used as the width/height of the enemy for the check.
 *     Otherwise, the enemy's normal width/height are used.
 * Some enemies treat pits/liquid as solid, EXCEPT if they are being knocked back.
 *     'bool knockback' here affects this for the placement checks.
 * Use the 'SPW_' constants to provide a special value;
 *     i.e. 'SPW_FLOATER' for flying enemies.
 * Use 'SPW_NONE' if you don't know what to use.
 * Returns true if the enemy could be placed successfully, false otherwise.```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 23:27

@ Moosh seems good?

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 23:28

Yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 23:43

@ Moosh if you can separate the stuff you found into bug report(s) that would be helpful. I'm done for tonight so no rush.

=== @ Moosh 04/17/2023 00:06

I assume the last one I posted is fixed already and doesn't need a report?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/17/2023 00:07

nothing fixed

=== @ Moosh 04/17/2023 00:08

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "note to self: make sure colli…"): Ah, this response made it sound like it was an easy one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/17/2023 00:09

I don't know if that will fix it or not, it's just an idea, and I didn't take the time to try it yet

=== @ Moosh 04/17/2023 00:09

gotcha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/17/2023 00:09

Could just be that easy
but, also, not really the most important thing to fix at the moment

=== @ Moosh 04/18/2023 09:22

also one extra confirmation, CanPlace() appears to be working great

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/18/2023 09:23

WOO!
glad to hear it!
