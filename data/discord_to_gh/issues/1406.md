1. Appears not to work on `Switch` combos
2. Does not trigger secret sfx?

Oh check #1207
i was under the impression it was a "feature" that needed to be added instead of something being broken, hence the category
sorry

I think, sound play on Screen->TriggerSecrets() call is excessive. Sometimes, you need silent secret triggering.

Does that play the SFX itself?
I thought it didn't

(replying to @ Alucard648 "I think, sound play on Screen…"): I have just brained and realized what you meant here
but this thread is about the combo flag `Triggers Secrets`, not `Screen->TriggerSecrets()`

Oh, forgot to update this thread
It now works fine on any combo type
and plays the screen secret sfx
and, unless the `Secrets are Temporary` flag is set, they are perm (as normal screen secrets usually do)
(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒'Triggers Secrets' issues
