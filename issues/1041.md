when I tried used dm->Type it returns 128 for a Dungeon Type dmap instead of 0. (found this out via the trace function.)

It returns the internal type data
you need to `&11b` it, IIRC
ex
```cpp
switch(dm->Type&11b)
{
    case DMAP_OVERWORLD:
        //blah blah
        break;
}```
....still have no clue WHY it's like that, should probably investigate further. Zoria's doing, I believe.

windows is complaining about these files being viruses.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2021 14:29

fun
windows hates zc

=== @ OmegaX 09/27/2021 16:11

Yeah, it also deletes the files when i try to open them. also, on an unrelated note: Trace is writing twice to allegro.log (ZScript Debug) instead of once. don't know why i need to do more testing...

=== @ OmegaX 09/27/2021 16:15

I have Trace run in a dmapdata script and it preform its function twice even though I have it written down once, one at the start before the warp opening starts and then another one after the warp animation is finish.

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) is this fixed?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/15/2022 09:28

@ OmegaX wait, I should be asking you
Sorry for the late ping, assuming you still use ZC

=== @ OmegaX 01/15/2022 09:29

Yep

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/15/2022 09:30

This fixed it?

=== @ OmegaX 01/15/2022 09:33

I believe it was fixed in a official build after this, yes.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/15/2022 09:36

Aight, thank you!
