`void Sort(int order, int values, bool largest_first = false);`
Would take two arrays of the same size. The function would write the indices of the value array in sorted order to the order array. The value array itself would not be changed. If largest_first is true, it sorts largest to smallest instead of smallest to largest.

Does this seem like it'd be useful @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ? Also which algorithm would be the best to use?

- can `largest_first = false` instead be `ascending = true` (or the inverse...)? Or could match python and have it be `reverse = false` (defaults to ascending order)
- `Sort` -> `SortIndices(int indices, int values, ...)`? It's an atypical way to sort by putting the results into another array, so worth making the function name more explicit

Oh yeah that's fair

=== @ Moosh 10/24/2023 02:13

Reason for the indices array instead of reordering the original is that sometimes in ZScript I'll want to sort the same array of objects in different ways. For example sorting by Y position to get a draw order and then sorting by distance to Link for some other behavior

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/24/2023 02:14

I think the use case makes sense for sure.

btw, how do we draw the line between new zasm commands, and simply a function in std lib? what did you have in mind for this?
"internal" = zasm command?

=== @ Moosh 10/24/2023 02:17

Oh yeah I was thinking a ZASM command because sorting algorithms tend to be both generally useful and potentially slow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/26/2023 01:36

Yeah, anything useful enough that would be good to *optimize* is basically the line for internalizing
definitely agree with an internal sort, that sounds great

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/26/2023 01:38

(replying to @ Moosh "Reason for the indices array‚Ä¶"): as for this though, you could also just memcpy the array (which, idk if that's internal yet? should be made internal if it isn't)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/26/2023 03:27

@ Moosh so if you go to implement this, you should do it on the `ZCArray` class in `zc_array.h`
....you should probably clean some of the junk related to multi-dimensional arrays out of that, because it's unused and a mess

=== @ Moosh 10/26/2023 03:28

were there plans for those at one point or what?
