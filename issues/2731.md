Only happens when "Old String Margins" is off. Seems the compat rule introduced a bug in this situation.

"old string margins" = hardcoded non-existant margins
so there was *no margin* to cut anything off

Right

...shadowed text needs to draw 1 pixel more to the right, if it has a leftward shadow
as anything left of the margin SHOULD be cut off
so the issue is that it shouldn't be trying to draw it left of the margin

fun...

the subcreen widget stuff has some stuff related to shadows in some places
`shadow_x`, `shadow_y` or something?
might be useful
