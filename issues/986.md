As requested, this is the old system where ZC loads all four quest icons for a quest when the save file's custom quest is first selected, and does not load them again even if the quest is changed in ZQuest.

^ Make togglable with a zc config, default auto-reload enabled (in case it's too laggy a load time for some people)
basically, just, on zc init, when it first loads all the saves, refresh the game icons from the quest file.
