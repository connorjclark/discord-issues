When I obtain the Map/Compass/Boss Key in Sidestory in the 9/4/2023 Nightly, they remain invisible.  I don't know what is exactly causing this

(for the record this happens in both ZQC Player and the Test Player, I showed the Test screens for ease of understanding)

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) worth looking to see if this problem still exists

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 04:11

...appears to

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 04:13

they work fine creating a new quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 04:15

....oh
in the affected quest, they are not `Itemclass: Map`
they are `Item: Map` for the specific map item ID

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 04:19

and yeah that is definitely the issue

as `game->get_item(iid)` would be false for those item ids in this block

...this behavior is inherently set up wrong, to be fair, and the way it works now SHOULD be correct
so it just needs to check one of the subscreen-related rules for compat handling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 04:39

...gah, except bleh, fuck
this is a tangled fucking mess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 04:40

...oh wait, no
BLEH I have a specific handling for this for class types that I don't for override types

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 04:45

literally just had to copypaste it
also fixed a minor gripe; we were calling `has_item` with `get_dlevel()` as the param, but using `-1` as a param for map/compass/bosskey ***automatically*** uses the current level.
