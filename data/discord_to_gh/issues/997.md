these enemy types are pretty infuriating for the player to deal with, so if it's possible i'd like the data of the enemy affect it in some way
examples being where the random rate can maybe affect it's fall path of going left and right, and 0 would maybe make it only fall one direction and have step speed affect how fast it falls down

a more elegant solution for your quest might be to add an npc script to be like oot
where if link has a L2 shield or better, and he's facing the rock, it kills itself and produces an effect (probably a LW_SPARKLE made to look like a shattering rock, i don't know if rocks have a normal death effect)

i like your idea but there IS one issue with it that would prevent it from being executed well
i don't know if rocks respect enemy placement flags 0-9
so a right-down moving rock might spawn on the right-top of the screen. not very effective

well that could also be added maybe
i got no idea how to do npc scripts
and besides i think it would be beneficial for everyone to have a simpler way to make them less frustrating to deal with that everyone has access to
and i feel that what i've suggested doesn't take away the spirit of how the enemy acts

i'm pretty sure you just add a script and you can assign it to the enemy (which also means the script can reference its parent enemy or tell it what to do)

i mean i don't know how to script npcs as in how they work, move, attack, etc;
