Just ran into this one, I had damage combo FFCs still doing base damage to Blue Ring. This quest originated in 2.52 with the global rule for Rings affecting Damage Combos toggled, and the Item Flags for all Rings are properly set.
Also, saving the quest to see if it was the old QR not working right in ZC did not change anything. Despite the flag being set, Damage Combos were still doing their base damage through Blue Ring.

Just confirming this is happening in the "latest" nightly too. Also happens through %based Rings.

On the other hand, it appears the same item flag*does* work properly with a Peril Ring. So it's specific to the standard Defense Rings.

Still in the latest nightly.
