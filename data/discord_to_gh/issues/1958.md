The idea here would be to have a tag in a script's metadata with a string, when the associated editor tabs are loaded or the script is changed, it'd check these tags and swap out the strings in the respective fields. Main thing I'm thinking here is combodata scripts changing Attribytes/Attrishorts/Attributes/Flags to have appropriate labels, since those are currently kinda ass to document for the user. It would be incredible if the metadata could also be used to define custom editor tooltips when pressing the [?] button, though I understand that'd be way harder. Of course this'd also be handy for InitD fields as well as Attributes on enemies and items.

Yeah, this would be an awesome feature if simple enough to implement

Agreed!  I can see people making tutorial-friendly skins for people.  Don't know how hard it is to force custom strings to fit into those [?] boxes cleanly though.
