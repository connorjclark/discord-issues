A warp combo that acts as a scrolling warp when you step on it, but with a defined direction. Specific use case would be doors that are away from the screen edges
Having worked with a script that does this (very jankily), I can say that this transforms how you handle dungeon design in more GB-oriented sets for the better

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/28/2021 23:53

Of course, for it to be fully feature complete, it'd need to put you on a return combo on the other side

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/28/2021 23:56

so, a fancy version of a scrolling warp

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/28/2021 23:57

yup
Scrolling warp has a problem in that it doesn't force your direction
so you could walk into a left door facing up, and you'll scroll the screen in the up direction

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Of course, for it to be fully‚Ä¶"): yeah i was gonna ask where do you *appear* on the second screen
also can't you use this to make mario esque pipes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/29/2021 00:30

Absolutely yeah, though they couldn't turn like some pipes in SMW (at least, not without some clever hacking of features like conveyors and switchblocks)

=== @ P-Tux7 08/29/2021 00:38

that's mario 3, mario world is infamous for not having any sort of scrolling pipes at all
it's just either inert pipes or "fade out, go to another room" pipes
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Absolutely yeah, though they‚Ä¶"): ~~or the raft~~

Maybe it could be two combos:

1)  Side Warp Trigger - With selectors for North/East/South/West, and Screen and Dmap coordinates, as well as a numerical identifier that would be paired with the combo below.

2)  Side Warp Arrival - Mostly just acts are a receiver for the above.  Its one property is the numerical identifier.

The numerical identifier acts as a warp coordinate receiver.  So a side warp trigger combo with ID 3 would send it to a Side Warp Arrival ID 3 on that screen.

Not sure how it would handle going between two such combos though in the case of a door that goes between two combos, like most traditional north/south doors.

Or would it just make more sense to keep the X or Y positioning (and Z, probably.) and just go to the next available side-warp arrival combo in that direction you're already traveling in from the first screen.

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "---
Or would it just make mor‚Ä¶"): this would make far more sense

=== @ P-Tux7 08/29/2021 02:06

ehh
i can see the use cases for manual arrival combos

Simething like this?|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSAEYBmX58Y

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 08/29/2021 02:19

Show-off. üòõ   But nah, it might be a combo that triggers the screen-scroll effect earlier, closer to the middle of the screen than being right on the very edge, and can probably even dump you somewhere not on the edge of the next screen too.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/29/2021 02:20

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Show-off. üòõ   But nah, it mig‚Ä¶"): basically this

=== @ P-Tux7 08/29/2021 02:21

yeah like again
mario/turtle rock pipes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/29/2021 02:21

Yeah
Though rafting would make more sense for same-screen pipes

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Show-off. üòõ   But nah, it mig‚Ä¶"): I found this script when digging through source code of Link Stuck in Castlevania. Setup instructions are inside script file.
