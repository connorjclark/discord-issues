Again, more scriptable events and stuff. Usually quest specific events to assign generic scripts on triggering them.

err, so how would you exactly trigger these?
because like, presumably, you'd call a function to send the event....
but at that point, why don't you just.... call a function that does the code you want?
There's no reason to link that to the events system, you just can already do that
(meta) thread name was changed: ❌Registering custom events for generic scripts.
