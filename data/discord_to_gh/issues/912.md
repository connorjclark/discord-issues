Or at the very least, have it so that combos such as lock blocks can work like regular locked doors in that they set the unlocked door status for the screen in the approprate dicretion.  It could be done through scripts, but it would be easier to add as a combo.

I am a little unclear what universal locked doors means

Are we talking about a lockblock combo you can place anywhere that just unlocks that one combo, permanently? That sounds useful but also maybe a bit tough to implement
