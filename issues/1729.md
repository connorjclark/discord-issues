This is more of a convenience feature.
When configing heart gauge pieces and magic gauge pieces, you only have the visual information based on what's in the quests init data.

Generally for a quest those numbers are far below the final count, so pieces are invisible and makes it hard to see what you're doing when you're editing. This saves a bunch of menuing back and forth in the program.

Either that or a toggle within the subscreen editor to "Display as if 99 hearts/magic pieces" would be convenient, just so you can see all of what you're working with.

This.... looks a lot more difficult than you would think
why the fuck is the subscreen code THIS BAD????

I'm, uh, just gonna have to say no to this request
it would take at least a week if not more of digging through this absolute garbage to begin to have an idea of how to do this sanely
and, it's not THAT much of an inconvenience to go to Init Data and set it to a higher number while you're editing your subscreen
