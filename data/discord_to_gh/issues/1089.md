=== @ FireSeraphim 10/06/2021 08:15

been testing the newest build and I'm running into a couple of "interesting" (in the chinese sense of the word) problems. I have a magic shield and fireballs from the zora still make the correct metallic ding noise when hitting link's shield but afterwords they keep on going. I believe this problem is also connected to another one where Link can seemingly only fire swordbeams once per screen.

*what* and *what*
fuuuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 15:38

I'd almost expect the first one to be part of the weapon unblockable flagset I added
....does that occur in A97?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/06/2021 20:03

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "been testing the newest build‚Ä¶"): worn-out sword

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 00:19

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Yes. I downloaded and tested both yesterday

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 05:46

Any progress on fixing the bug I mentioned?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:11

OK, started testing
1. I can fire multiple swordbeams, so I don't seem to be able to replicate that issue
2. Zora fireballs clink against my magic shield and die
so uh
@ FireSeraphim any chance you can provide a quest where this happens?

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:17

I'm sending you the latest copy of my quest via DM. That's where it's happening for me/

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:25

So, the sword beam

You have it set so weapons can go offscreen thanks to that compat rule
.....so, the sword beam is never dying.
And you can't have more than one alive at once

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:26

I don't think I touched that setting. The shield thing is still disconcerting though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:27

what screen will I find a Zora on
oh
right there
ummm
the fireball dies on the shield
just as expected

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:28

Wha?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:28

oh
it's the *same QR*
causing both issues
@ DeletedUser Do you at all recall what `Weapons Can Go Out of Bounds (Offscreen)` was compat for?
because it seems to cause a number of issues
(For now @ FireSeraphim just uncheck the rule. Generally, you don't want most compat rules on if you can help it)

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:30

Aye. I think I put it on to prevent the old "hiding in the dungeon's doorways to avoid enemy projectiles" tactic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:31

Generally speaking compat rules should be off if you can help it, as usually they are just enabling old bugs
like this one you have on

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895222731581321216/895664743631704074/unknown.png?ex=65e9c1cb&is=65d74ccb&hm=2025a838f494eed3ed654cf1499f5834818e60cd200ecdda095995b429a11308&)
light force magic ring doubles as magic wallet
because, it used to, for some reason, because bug
....some of them make sense to leave on, though, until you have a reason to remove them

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895222731581321216/895665074918801428/unknown.png?ex=65e9c21a&is=65d74d1a&hm=83c75e34eea4ccb71b6afb078533860553c7ab636adc0afeb51e82dd9bf30813&)

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:33

To be fair thought the tileset in my quest started out as FYS and I think it had a few of those rules enabled since FYS was made in a older version of ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:33

unchecking THOSE would require adding `16` to the width/height of every string you have in the string editor
which would be tedious
so unless you have a reason that you need the bug fixed there, leaving those on is generally ok
(If you are just starting a new project I always recommend disabling them at the *start*)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:34

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) It is for scrolling engine scripts.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:34

What was it's compat purpose
it's in compat rules

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:34

Oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:34

was that placement a mistake?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:34

that was a2.50.0 compatibility thing
weapons w/o colision can go off screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:35

no
that's this one

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895222731581321216/895665651140673626/unknown.png?ex=65e9c2a3&is=65d74da3&hm=8c69f25c7992b388511d86a9484f9c283b930974ac8f5a68200c07441b9283dd&)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:35

2.50.0 stuff broe in 250.1 and that wasaddedto fix those games
it's in the historic changelog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:36

`"Weapons Can Go Out of Bounds (Offscreen)", qr_WEAPONSMOVEOFFSCREEN`
`"Weapons With No Collision Detection Move Offscreen", qr_OFFSCREENWEAPONS`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:36

I added the OoB rule for scrolling

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2021 13:36

out of curiousity what is "New Water Collision" and "New Shallow Water Detection"?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:36

Those are Dimi's work

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:37

but the other one is a legit compat rule added by Saf or Gleeok back around 2011/12

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:37

I'd recommend all of these be checked @ FireSeraphim
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895222731581321216/895666091555172392/unknown.png?ex=65e9c30c&is=65d74e0c&hm=45e4a875b48819fb9be137d2c8b9d86de23c5c710b6dfa01057a794bbddedb89&)
so it seems like `"Weapons Can Go Out of Bounds (Offscreen)"` should not be a compat rule
and also bugs the shit out of things anyway
fun times

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:38

`* Added a compatibility rule allowing weapons with collision detection disabled to move offscreen. ( Saffith, 2015-06-12 13:19:44 )`
`"Weapons Can Go Out of Bounds (Offscreen)"`
that shouldbe a weapon rule

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:39

aye, that's where I was moving it

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:39

its hould not be enabled by default

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:39

and I'm giving it `"Weapons Can Go Out of Bounds (Buggy, don't use)"` for now, considering it clearly isn't fit to be used in its' current state

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:39

it is absolutely needed for games with Z3 scrolling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:39

It shouldn't be a QR, though
it should be a flag on weapons
set by script

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:40

it changes the entire mechanic that ZC uses for weapon destruction
and it is global

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:40

it skips one switch statement
in one file
in weapons.cpp

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:41

I now whatit does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:41

it could certainly be done better as a weapon flag
so you can set each weapon to be offscreen or not

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:41

four of my games happen to rely on it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:41

aye, can't remove the rule now, it needs to stay for compat purposes
but it should never have been added as a rule in the first place

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:42

feel free to add a separate flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:42

for now, renaming the rule
`"Weapons Move Offscreen (Buggy, use at own risk)"`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:42

but I needed *all* weapons to be able to go offscreen 
 and  back into view.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:43

and moving it to `weapons` rules

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:43

it isn't buggy but it also isn't intended to be used in normal quests ü§∑

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:43

Enabling the rule causes buggy behavior
and without a warning like that
we will get bug reports
like this one

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:44

must have forgotten a shieldcanblock check, as that was not intended
leave it live as a bug report, and I will loo into it in the future

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:45

(meta) thread name was changed: Weapons Move Offscreen is buggy

a weapon hitting a shield or an enemy should maek it wDead

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 05:23

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "out of curiousity what is "Ne‚Ä¶"): Late response, but New Water Collision changes water collision internally (honestly, it should be a compat rule instead of a combo rule), and this change I believe is required for both the new Effects square, Bridge combos, and letting you use FFCs as land, as well as some combination of the 4 quest rules that follow (I don't know off the top of my head)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 05:24

New Shallow Water Collision changes Shallow Water to use the same detection it uses to check for regular water, so you can no longer be swimming and have the shallow water graphic display under you. It's also helpful for if you want to use poisonous shallow water.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 17:49

ffcs as land? you mean you can have moving platform FFCs now?
of course the moving link with it would have to be scripted but still

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 19:50

Okay, so that behavior was... sorta implemented before
As in you can walk onto it and not start swimming
but uh, once you're already swimming you can't get off onto the ffc
