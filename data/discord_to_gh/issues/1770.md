It would be nice if raising something to an exponent had it's own operator. I propose `**` since a couple of programming languages already use that, and it's less clunky than having to call `Pow()` for such a basic math operation.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/23/2022 03:59

If I were to add that, it wouldn't be good for rewrite, because `*` is used for pointers
and, like, `a ** b` could then mean `a to the b power` OR `a times (what b points to)`
so, meh
powers also, while you may call them a basic math operation, are NOT generally a basic code operation

I am skeptical as to how rare of an operation it is in languages, but the ambiguity on the end of the parser makes a lot of sense.

In most programming languages ^ is exponential operator, so A^2 is ewual to A*A .

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/23/2022 08:50

`^` is bitwise xor
so `A^A` is equal to 0

=== @ Orithan 07/23/2022 10:35

I wonder the rationale behind it being bitwise xor

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/23/2022 12:35

Is `^^` occupied for anything?

=== @ Orithan 07/23/2022 14:25

AFIAK yes
It's logical ``XOR``

=== @ Orithan 07/23/2022 14:31

``true ^^ true`` returns ``false``

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/23/2022 14:42

Hear me out
How about
`^^^`
I have found 1 programming language which uses ^^^ for exponentiation
