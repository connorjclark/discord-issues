Thanks!

Shield chink, block push

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:10

So here's what I got
-Shield tink
-Block pushing
-Key unlocking (could this be separated into Normal Lock, Boss Lock, Shutter Closing, and Shutter Opening...?) I swear there's something else that uses this
-Z1 Walk-Through Dungeon Wall Thing
I'll also have to check if solving a Maze Path uses a hardcoded sound, or if it uses either the maze screen or destination screen's secret sound.
Also, are the two poking sword tinks (normal and "this is bombable") hardcoded or itemdata?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:11

screen secrets (for the maze)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:11

:good:

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:12

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Also, are the two poking swor‚Ä¶"): great question

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:14

Also, the Ganon Room Intro sound. His death too, but Deedee will probably make that npcdata. Unsure whether she will for the "item appearing on his ashes" and "collected said item" sounds. It's a little niche but could be npcdata
...also niche but I'm unsure if the Ganon Room Intro sound could be read from the first Ganon NPC in the room's npcdata
(Though Deedee, I care much less about sounds and just him being able to drop the screen item like on NES! lol)
Win Game sound

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:17

I'll also have to check if Bomb Octoroks' bomb explosions and Bombchus' explosions use npcdata attack sounds. Maybe not because they're not "attacks" per se

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:17

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:18

OH
CHARGING WEAPONS (L1/L2)
i'm unsure if that could be itemdata or even already is; it's 2 AM sorry lol

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:21

So as for Misc. Sprites, what have we got so far again? Anything since A101?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:21

nothing new

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:22

screencap please?
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): I guess this needs to be non-hardcoded to #34 too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:24

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:25

Er... do enemies have their own falling sprites yet?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:25

no, they use the misc one

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:25

OH ok
I was like "Wait, this doesn't account for LTMs?"
phew
I know Zoria wanted per-enemy ones and it would be slightly handy as it was used in LTTP for knights, Hardhat Beetles, and Helmasaurs, though it's low priority IMO

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:27

Ok, dumb question, but why isn't Switch Poof "read from itemdata of highest-level owned Switch Hook"?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:28

The misc one is not used for the switchhook

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:28

Again it's niche but I guess that's what the order of the day is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:28

it's used for the switch with enemy defense type

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:28

OH yeah the defence
I appreciate your thoroughness
Oh, here's a new Misc. SFX - Turn Into/From Bunny
Can't be in the Moon Pearl itemdata because you can turn into/from a bunny before owning one

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:31

And another SFX - that "bleem!" when you reach the end of a string in a Learn Slash or Half Magic room

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:31

if you could pin any suggestions you make, that'd be good
that way I can unpin them to mark them done

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:32

...and the Guy spawn sound in general. I thought that was tied to the string sound but it happens even in stringless rooms (Potion Shop)
I can?
...I cannot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:32

oh crap
one sec

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:33

note for the pins

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:33

you had perms in bug reports/feat requests, but not dev plans

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:33

(Ganon sounds are low-priority until Deedee decides which ones will be npcdata)

Speculative ones are not pinned yet. If confirmed to be hardcoded (tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow...), I'll edit them to affirm that they are hardcoded and pin them

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:38

Note to self: Check Fire Octorok explosion in addition to Bomb Octoroks' and Bombchus'

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:46

Potion Shop Reveal Sound
...this *may* be screen 83's secret sound, or the secret sound of the non-cave screen you set as a Potion Shop, but I'd really have to test that because I don't trust caves as far as I can throw them. Which I can't do.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:54

PLAYER DEATH SOUND
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
i'm a fucking idiot thanks vlamart

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:56

wait uh... do we have per-quest game over MIDIs yet?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:58

ZC save menu options that use extant sound effects:
Paging through files: Rupee
Entering letters: Place Down Bomb
Delete File: Link Hurt
Selecting options on the Game Over screen: Shield Tink (not sure if the quest's Shield Tink affects how this sounds)
Entering a Cave/Entrance (separate?)
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 08:59

(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2022 08:59

Uhg
The save screen stuff I think has been configurable via scripts for a while thanks to zoria

=== @ P-Tux7 01/19/2022 09:02

i'll check to see if the quest's shield tinks are used or not

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 19:31

Sprite: Ganon's Explosion (may or may not be npcdata later)
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
???: Ending Link and Zelda Triforce holding up animations
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
(Are the tiles to the left of them even used?)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 19:36

Boomerang/Arrow Spark
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
Guy Fires (Not the Fire Guy itself, the ones that spawn NEXT TO them) and their revenge fireballs
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
Hardcoded sprites that are used in multiple contexts, so may or may not be hard to separate them:
-Heart Container
--Leave Your Life Or Money
-Rupee
--Shop Price Indicator
--Leave Your Life Or Money
--Pay For Info
--More Bombs
--More Arrows
-Small Triforce Piece
--Ganon Room intro
--Ending
So tiles 28, 29, and 41 I have no idea where they are used
Reflected Enemy Sword Explosion (I THINK this reuses one of Link's sword beam explosions, so it does use a Misc. Sprite that you can edit, but it would be nice to make it unique)
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 19:42

Also, I'll have to test if the Fairy Pond "heart ring" uses a hardcoded tile, or if it reuses your life meter. Likely the former
(Come to think of it, it only using *one-quarter* of a hardcoded tile would be even more unpleasant for questmakers)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2022 13:38

Guy Fire fireball-shooting sound
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 02/14/2022 21:23

Oh! can we please have a "subscreen opened" and "subscreen closed" sound
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 03/02/2022 00:11

#1440
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 03/02/2022 00:17

Are the L1 and L2 charge sounds in the Misc. SFX yet?
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 03/03/2022 01:14

i have no idea how feasible this is but i once requested a selector for the game over midi and i think that fits the idea of this thread
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 03/03/2022 01:16

since it and credits are the only hardcoded songs now that Triforce Pieces can play their own selected MIDI upon collection, and almost everyone who wants custom credits music isn't using the z1 credits

=== @ P-Tux7 03/03/2022 01:18

come to think of it... can I expand this thread's scope to hardcoded CSets? @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/03/2022 01:20

ü§¢
Separate that

=== @ P-Tux7 03/08/2022 01:57

pound - water (attribute? might not be feasible to make customizable for half-shallow/swimmable half-walkable, so would be useful as a fallback)
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 03/09/2022 18:12

Selector 1 (In Front of Items) and 2 (Behind Items)
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ vlamart 03/09/2022 18:51

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Selector 1 (In Front of Items‚Ä¶"): I never knew that's what the difference was

=== @ P-Tux7 03/09/2022 18:53

yeah
the same goes for the nayru's love parts
using both of them cleverly, you can make a sprite for the selector/crystal that appears to go in front of and behind the item/Link

=== @ vlamart 03/09/2022 23:41

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Selector 1 (In Front of Items‚Ä¶"): Also, I just realised these aren't hardcoded sprites, but hardcoded ITEMS with no associated sprites in the sprite data list. This is the same with heart pieces

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/09/2022 23:45

anything to do with the subscreen automatically sucks extremely badly

=== @ vlamart 03/10/2022 00:09

Figured since it's the least intuitive of anything in the editor haha

=== @ vlamart 03/25/2022 15:46

Is there a newer list of hardcorded sfx?
Where would you set enemy attack sounds?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2022 15:47

Uhhh
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/25/2022 15:49

You can't set enemy attack sfx
that's hardcoded based on weapon type

=== @ vlamart 03/25/2022 15:55

I thought so. Zelda and Ganon jingles hardcoded? (I'm going through setting up sfx from the blank quest. So now that I know things are hardcoded after going through most enemies/guys, items, and sprites, I think sfx is the last thing). I'll try to write up a little doc of what I've found hardcoded and where for organization purposes, but won't be 100%

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2022 15:57

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "You can't set enemy attack sfx"): probably should fix this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/25/2022 16:00

Probably should, when I can get to it

=== @ vlamart 03/25/2022 22:35

Updated with sfx info

Stun An Enemy
Enemy Shield Block Sound/Enemy Immune Sound (same sound in code or not?)
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 08/01/2022 02:50

hmm... turns out stunning an enemy uses that enemy's hit sound, i'll make a request for a QR to make it use a general sound
