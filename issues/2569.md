Not sure if this is a bug or not but if I manually palce a fairy ring (all) flag, Link triggers it when he is half on the combo (meaning if the combo position I placed it on has top half solidity I still trigger it), but if the flag is on a fully solid combo and I walk half onto it it doesnt trigger

. . .
This seems to have been done intentionally for some reason
the section for placed fairy flags
has an extra check
with comment `//2.10 compatibility` next to it

...easy enough to compat rule

This would be a bug fix not a feature request btw
but either way, fixed

Thanks

=== @ Deathrider 08/06/2023 17:29

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/06/2023 17:53
