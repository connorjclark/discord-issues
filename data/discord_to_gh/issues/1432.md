For some reason, at random times the keybind screen doesn't work with the mouse buttons. You can "fix" it by moving with the arrow keys.

k, I see what's wrong
calling the screen update function only actually updates the screen 60 times a second, no matter how often it's called
but, that's not a LOOP
it calls it once, then hangs until you press a key
so if that call doesn't hit the 60/th of a second, it doesn't draw the prompt to press any key to the screen
need to add a way to FORCE update regardless of the vsync
