@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) adding to thread

So, I have A5 `ALLEGRO_FONT` objects from A4 `FONT` objects for all of our system fonts now
...in theory, I should be able to have a version of the dialog opening function that opens an A5-only dialog
and, upgrade the new GUI system widgets to use upgraded procs that use A5 draws?
Then, *all* new dialogs would automatically be pure A5

@ Moosh gonna pull you in here too
sooo

Look at that *window*
The title, the titlebar, the main window background rectangle, the `X` button in the upper right.
All A5 drawn in truecolor.
Compare: old

...the left and right colors are reversed, should be easy to fix that
and there is a bit of a sharp line along the top/left of the new one
but, first successful compile attempt
with a correct palette - those are all A5 colors

=== @ Moosh 02/25/2023 19:21

ooh, that is fancy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 19:22

and THERE we go

that sharp edge was an off-by-one in `jwin_draw_frame_a5()`
easy fix
I love the much smoother color transition between the two colors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 19:26

The titlebar blending was actually mostly rewritten
because so much of it was just based in a4 shit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 19:56

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "that sharp edge was an off-by…"): (A close look at the off-by-1 error, for any curious:

Ooh. Nifty

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 23:21

If you use non-multiple-of-4 values, it will end up truncating them to multiple of 4 for *MOST* purposes
(i.e. it stores it divided by 4 in the A4 palette, as normal)
....but the A5 dialog work, like the fancy window, will respect the full color

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 23:23

...visual representation of the screen:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079181814347862056/image.png?ex=65ecef62&is=65da7a62&hm=59aa455f52dbbab56ca6bd7aa39e228fcc283f29a088de282e0d7bde17026733&)
`0, 3, 6:` These are... buffer screens as a result of recursive calls. They are kinda jank, but they end up fully transparent.
`1, 2:` the A5 and A4 draw layer for the launcher dialog
`4,5:` the A5 and A4 draw layer for the theme editor dialog (within the launcher dialog)
`7,8:` the a5 and a4 draw layer for an 'are you sure' popup (within the theme editor dialog)
*real layers*, beautiful.

tabpanels done
(Designed a small system that lets me change colors for a proc to be a separate 'debug palette', which I just stole from the Ruby theme file)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 18:33

OOOKAY

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079471347656298587/image.png?ex=65e4c288&is=65d24d88&hm=805ed1ae74073b4729d8aeafe7c7fbbd2fc98f52f82685526f6715ffa41ed762&)
So, windows, tabs, and scrollpanes
all working, with mostly just one notable tweak
the scrollbar's light area is no longer a dithered checkerboard of `jcLIGHT` and `jcBOX`, but instead just a solid `jcLIGHT`
...because the way it did that checkerboard used some sort of patterned drawing mode, which I don't see an A5 equivalent for after a bit of searching

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/27/2023 01:37

Everything in `InfoDialog` is now A5
Specifically, done is:
Window
TabPanel
ScrollingPane
Label
Button

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/27/2023 05:00

*fuuuck*
so

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079629174404296766/image.png?ex=65e55585&is=65d2e085&hm=5f2fc16eed8cc337984d1df78c4b42e2fec34e4e854eee685868611038383253&)
Tile editor now using A5 stuff, despite not being a real dialog at all
The "Invalid Static", as well as the normal invalid white Xs, are both done through A5 as well- the only part that is not A5 is the tiles themselves
Importantly, the RenderTreeItem for this dialog is NOT the full size of the screen
it is the size of the *window*
....which meant requiring adjusting every single draw to NOT offset from the window
and all mouse stuff too
...without those adjustments, it'd look something like this
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079629821816090704/image.png?ex=65e55620&is=65d2e120&hm=7cfa5ee441b203ddc030c84d9752cf5c902204f1d4a4951e0871d8c3a46782a7&)
which, is the combo pages
which, I still need to do
fully
*fuck me*
Oh, also
the transparent color of the A4 bitmap of the tile page now
is 255, not 0- which solves the problem of color 0 not appearing properly.
color 255 should not naturally appear anywhere here, so, should be safe to mask out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/27/2023 05:08

....I fixed the grabber window being offset, though not upgrading shit about that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/27/2023 05:53


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079642535451951114/image.png?ex=65e561f7&is=65d2ecf7&hm=fb4960d4cf1767097b97bf5c634b491c3eab86dacabc9e5f84fd02cec451fd0a&)
and combo window done to match the tile window
Also, those up/down arrows in the lower-right?
Those USED to be TEXT
`\x88`/`\x89` characters
which in `lfont_l` are up/down arrows
.....A5 font does not appear to allow those characters? I tried my best but couldn't get it to work
So, I stole the arrow drawing code that scrollbars use
split it to be able to draw not on a button
and that's using that now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/27/2023 06:35

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943757872154705942/1079652343513100308/image.png
woo, the static is 1x1 again
without frames dropping to "barely able to run"
(The first time it goes to draw the static, it creates a 1024x1024 A5 bitmap full of static, which is drawn pixel-by-pixel)
(but, then each time it goes to draw a static tile, it blits a random section of that bitmap, instead of needing to draw pixel-by-pixel again)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/27/2023 06:41

now it's as simple as `draw_static(x,y,w,h)`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/27/2023 08:46


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079685866101944350/image.png?ex=65e58a52&is=65d31552&hm=dda47b1c07a6be10957ef057d67d2f5900b1a9947f152c979eda65f72aa4d16f&)
The color selector here is now fully A5
which is beautiful, as it no longer has to fuck with the palette constantly
it can just truecolor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/27/2023 10:01

OK so I got fancy
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079704750674677830/image.png?ex=65e59be8&is=65d326e8&hm=0d0bf4111da908bec6bf8305b43fb625c91e86273be96ede8aa2c195c6eba71e&)
Scrollpane is now SUPER fancy
because
the A5 stuff INSIDE the scrollpane
....is being drawn to a separate child RenderTreeItem
It's using a transform, so the coordinates remain relative to the window, not the scrollpane

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/27/2023 19:05

Continuing the work
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079841849251995698/image.png?ex=65e61b97&is=65d3a697&hm=346a3a87f020b20ca5af1b95b07750e8b300285aeadc4452a15a7cd864d13d64&)
A5-ified the main bar and top 2 buttons
and, the info text over the screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/27/2023 19:07

I had added the option to give that infotext a black background a bit ago
but with A5, it can now be a *transparent* black background

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/28/2023 02:01

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771929139485736981/1079946027244716092/image.png
Everything here is A5 except:
-the 4 tiles in the upper right
-The tool buttons in the upper left (the buttons are A5, the images drawn over them are A4)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/28/2023 02:39

also real transparency for the next-screen preview
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079955939186196570/image.png?ex=65e685d8&is=65d410d8&hm=66d11cd3642b702313d5518f6d9e4dcad9013d702c3fedba8a0f809a72e0a236&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/28/2023 05:04

the actual "dropped" part of dropdowns
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079992522153144391/image.png?ex=65e6a7ea&is=65d432ea&hm=d66e46dec03d0338fdc91be218b4fea16587c48a830990d2cf2e926645b41c15&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/28/2023 05:08

...whiich, realistically, was mostly just upgrading listers
so it took only 5 more edits (3 characters added, each) to reach this:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1079993500583600169/image.png?ex=65e6a8d3&is=65d433d3&hm=890830a7c0004248db87a7b9874de7ee61364aab4638f5b4a9f9ef16db8c1016&)
So, if I can do:
-the droplist main unit
-the frame proc
-textfields
then Init Data dialog will be 100% A5

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/28/2023 06:14

also, fix the debug palette to be more readable:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079081982673309737/1080010168978378863/image.png?ex=65e6b859&is=65d44359&hm=6941d183b6c188cca72a194d6e11aab73177553873793ace05dee9086a9b6a7e&)
....this is the actual Ruby palette
I ripped the colors *but not the jwin vals* from it
so what I was using before was kinda mooshmood with the ruby colors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/28/2023 19:32

OK, time for textfields
which are made of:```
jwin_edit_proc
jwin_numedit_proc
jwin_hexedit_proc
jwin_swapbtn_proc
jwin_numedit_swap_byte_proc
jwin_numedit_swap_sshort_proc
jwin_numedit_swap_zsint_nodec_proc
jwin_numedit_swap_zsint_proc
jwin_numedit_swap_zsint2_proc```

=== @ NightmareJames 03/01/2023 00:23

I was wondering what A5 meant offhand (dumbass me, lol).  Good stuff, this is certainly an improvement
Figured it out late

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 01:32

ahk so
textfields done
spent like 4 hours fucking with scrollpanes again because found more issues with them
pretty sure they are finally completely sane
just spent a while fucking with buttons
apparently using `al_put_pixel` for anything at all is a very bad idea without first locking the bitmap
so, lesson learned
(When it drew the focus dotted border, it then kinda locked up and wouldn't draw anything else there? Was really weird, but locking fixed it, so, 🤷‍♀️ )
also, the dotted borders on the really small `?` buttons bothered the SHIT out of me
so
I added some math

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 01:35

and now it calculates how close to the edge of the button it should place the dotted border, based on the font height compared to button height, and text width compared to button width. The dotted border will never overlap text, meaning on the particularly small buttons there will be no dotted border at all (though, the edge of the button is still darkened when focused, so you can still tell)

(you can see the A4 blue border around the tile/color squares, those are... close to all that's left?)

(the text is part of the squares, so, same widgets)
super close to being able to make new gui dialogs *not need an A4 layer at all*
