Themes need to be set individually for ZC, ZQuest, and ZLaunch. Additionally, when you change a theme, you get a popup comfirming you want to keep the theme... but if you select keep and then change tabs without pressing save, the selection is immediately discarded. Ideally, the save button should be done away with, given that it prompts you keep or revert when changing a theme to begin with, and an option to set the theme for all three programs at once would also be great.

lets do one tab in launcher for Themes

each app has a theme file picker. no save btn, as russ said. add a button by each for "apply to all".
