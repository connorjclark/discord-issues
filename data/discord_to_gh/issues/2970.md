It's being rendered to a different bitmap than what is used in the rendering system.

`DIALOG_PLAYER *p = init_dialog(editmidi_dlg,-1);`

not much uses this function. is this a matter of moving it to do_zqdialog? or do we change the gui bitmap first? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

ah... it's doing this customly because it needs to update the current midi pos live as it plays to keep synced with the music

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/09/2024 07:29

none of the `do_` functions related to running dialogs are set to handle this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/09/2024 07:30

time to port this to new gui then?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/09/2024 07:30

no, because
it probably just needs a `popup_zqdialog_start()` before it and `popup_zqdialog_end()` after it?
Those write to the global `screen` bitmap, setting it to a different pointer
...which I would expect to solve this?
(so, it still needs to manually do all of what it's already doing, being my point; but it should just be wrappable in that to fix it)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/09/2024 07:32

yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/09/2024 07:32

(alternately we could make a new func similar to `do_zqdialog_custom` which takes a proc *to run on every update*, and swap it over to that)
(`do_zqdialog_custom` has a proc to run *on every RETURN*, which is different)
...but probably can just leave it as it with the wrapper

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/09/2024 07:34

^ the end should be *after* `shutdown_dialog`
as the dialog hasn't closed until that finishes
and could still decide to access the `screen` pointer for some reason (potentially, probably not, but better safe than sorry)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/09/2024 07:48

basically my understanding is that `init_dialog` handles setting the starting focus object and sending `MSG_START`, and `shutdown_dialog` handles `MSG_END`. Plenty of gui procs do some stuff at the top *before* checking the incoming message, so best practice is to assume the dialog is still fully running for that duration.
Been a while since I actually was digging into these though lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/09/2024 07:49

I should probably work on going through and upgrading some older dialogs...
