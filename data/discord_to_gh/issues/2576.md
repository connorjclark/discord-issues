How about a new feature, that, when an item is selected, every sub item in the family opens up in a set box location, and you can pick each level item from there. Like say you had 5 levels of wands. When youre on the wand, you can pick from all the wands in a left/right menu. An alternative would be having L/R switch between different items in the family.

(replying to @ BigJoe "How about a new feature, that…"): not in engine but there would be a way to script this

will scripts run at the active subscreen time?
