Keyboard input for the entire keyboard must be saved each frame, in addition to control state input.

scripts can read this input and rely on it for replaying

I don't see how the first image relates

Do you mean keys even unassociated with button mappings?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:33

the first image on the left was recorded, and when played back the right was the output
so that's showing the desync
And, yes
the script I tested here was using NUMPAD 2,4,6,8
using `Input->KeyPress[KEY_2_PAD]` etc
which read those arrays there
scripts access all 3 of those which poll each frame similar to control_state
err well no
disabledkeys isn't polled from anything
it's written to by scripts
the other 2 are polled

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 15:36

Can you attach the script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:38

I've already edited it
but uhh

```cpp
global script test
{
    void run()
    {
        until(Input->KeyPress[KEY_K]) Waitframe();
        while(true)
        {
            Screen->Rectangle(7,0,0,256,176,0x01,1,0,0,0,true,OP_OPAQUE);
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
Record anything with that where you press `K` on the keyboard and it should desync

I guess I need to also store the clients button mappings too, if I want to attempt not storing both key and button state for the same thing
Or switch to just recording keys ... And save the mapping

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:41

do note that scripts can modify the keys/buttons separately
....not sure if that actually matters?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 15:43

It shouldn't. I believe both get reset every frame anyhow. It's all finicky tho so I'll have to be careful
