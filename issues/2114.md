If you go to enter a new file in ZC (Register Your Name) and then decide you didn't want to make a new file and press Esc to cancel, ZC Locks Up (need to close it with task manager)

Okay, this has been around much longer than I expected. Went as far back as the 12-07 build and it fully freezes up there too. The only build I have earlier than that is 6-23, where Esc to cancel file creation works fine.

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) I'm guessing this doesn't poll input properly anymore?
and is just.... staying in that infinite loop forever?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 19:05

....yep, just needed a `poll_keyboard();` call in that loop
fixed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/02/2023 19:17

correct
Before it used interrupts
But that is not consistent during replay so switched to polling

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/02/2023 20:37

found two more inside zq
