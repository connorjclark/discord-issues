yup
i thought deedee already added it?
but i guess not

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/18/2021 11:32

I might've added it!
I have a really bad memory though
I won't be able to dig through the code and check until after I have a nap though, cause code is starting to blur together for me

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 22:10

oh wait
so it seems that you can set the generic combo to trigger secrets, and for it to be "singular secret" or not
i'll test this soon

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 22:32

yup, works, thanks, i think this can be closed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 22:37

it actually triggers secrets?
Like completely, not just a specific secret type or only the 16-31?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 22:56

well this is a nightmare

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 22:58

if you have it set to not be always triggered, triggering it doesn't seem to do anything

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:00

but if you set it to always be triggered, it does seem to trigger all room secrets
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/910841592091410452/911752798574637187/triggersecrets2.qst?ex=65ece9f6&is=65da74f6&hm=c0021b276b9d1f85a8b936cf49c6b68a9e5ae03ec12670f7e96e0d650207ea6c&
(forgive me for forgetting to set a secret combo for the bomb-triggered tree, but you'll see it get triggered and disappear in the second quest)
so here we have a tree corner, that when slashed with a sword, should be triggered. it is triggered properly in both quests as you can tell because it goes to the next combo. quest 2 has it be "always triggered". it's triggered there too because it goes to the next combo there too.
but in quest 1, it doesn't trigger any secrets despite triggers secrets being set
but in quest 2 it does trigger all the secrets - secret tiles 0-3 appear, and the bomb and blue candle flags make their respective secret tiles appear
so uh, the idea here is that in quest 1, when manually triggering it, the stuff that happens when it's always triggered in quest 2 should happen

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:06

...wait, is "Triggers Secrets" meaning that triggering that combo should trigger secrets, or that that combo appearing should trigger secrets? it sounds like the first considering always triggering the combo in quest 2 triggers secrets

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:24

it's weird

=== @ P-Tux7 11/27/2021 02:55

ok so since you're talking about secrets in purezc @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) you might want to look at this again
"secret-triggering x"es would be a really neat thing to have pre-built in tilesets and especially without wasting a flag

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/27/2021 02:59

secret triggering x?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/27/2021 03:13

you know, like something with an inherent secret-triggering combo flag
but using the triggered by... menu
for things more specific than "any weapon" and less specific than "only one type of weapon"
trees, ice, rocks...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/27/2021 03:21

ohh, yeah

Right
I did this

=== @ P-Tux7 11/27/2021 03:51

the test quests above have that checked in both
but it only works in the one where the combo is Always Triggered, not the one where you manually-trigger it
great job so far just a bit more

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/27/2021 04:18

Ahh, okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/27/2021 06:51

The manual trigger of a single flag type needs to allow for fully triggering

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/27/2021 11:21

?
unsure what you mean

=== @ P-Tux7 11/27/2021 17:59

this has nothing to do with flag types
i didnt enter any secret flag type to trigger
i just checked what triggers the combo and that it triggers secrets

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/27/2021 18:45

oh wait
what combo type is it you're using?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/27/2021 18:53

generic
at least iirc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/28/2021 13:50

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "but it only works in the one…"): @ P-Tux7 Triggers Secrets appears to work in general
I just checked with sword and triggers secrets checked on an armos combo

=== @ P-Tux7 11/28/2021 20:29

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "if you have it set to not be…"): Ok so, explain this?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2021 09:17

@ P-Tux7
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Ok so, explain this?"): I'll take a look at it

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 11:25

There it is, thank you

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 01:42

is this in alpha 100 or not

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/19/2021 07:11

Can you check to see if the "triggers secrets" checkbox in the Triggers tab works?
If it doesn't work, can you check if it works for non-generic combos
it's been a while, so I'm unsure if I've fixed it in the meantime. having stuff on my mind

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:06

@ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:10

check generic combos first?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:14

well this is certainly something
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/910841592091410452/926659652828160020/triggers1.qst?ex=65ebc60d&is=65d9510d&hm=4c9b4e888c89566e0f9378cd204de3d18770748ab3a2308d4ecf2618fa431db5&
none combo, triggered by boomerang, triggers screen secrets
however, change it to a Generic combo, and it doesn't trigger screen secrets
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/910841592091410452/926659891542773841/triggers2.qst?ex=65ebc646&is=65d95146&hm=0cdeb71d8f51ea1aefc605455f6668f18ff135b0904f51b14bf1fd7b434f7f55&
oh yeah, is there any way to make hitting it play the secret sound?
if not perhaps that should be the default and it only doesn't play the secret sound if the no secret sounds screen flag is checked

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:24

hmm

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 17:42

bump

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 17:43

still doing the same thing in the latest buildpack with these quests

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 17:46

or should we move this to bug reports...
