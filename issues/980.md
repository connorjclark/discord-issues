I'd like them to have seperate flags for letting them only/either affect the sword, hammer, or wand.

(Tbh I want a flag where it only affects the sword but i felt that having one for all 3 would be courteous to others who'd like to choose exactly what it affects.)

this makes sense, will just take a bit of fiddling to make sure the flags are checked by default in qst.cpp

having rings that affect the power of any lweapon and you could mix and match different rings and their flags for easier power upgrades/ring systems in quests instead of wasting tons of item space on a million upgrades to the items would also be neat, but i think that'll be a lil too much
so keeping it simple to just these are a good start.
