Alpha 115, might have been in prior builds until I get confirmation from someone who's currently asleep. Used a fresh file to test the engine feather after hearing some issues with it. Can confirm that assigning the feather to these buttons causes it to only work once until you click/freeze the screen and resume. For the Ex buttons I only tested Ex1 but I assume it will be the same with the rest.

Fixed behind the broken inputs QR. I tested everything still works ... Deathrider's various map input bugs, Banana's swords, roc's feather....
