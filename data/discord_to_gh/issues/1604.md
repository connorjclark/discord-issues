Previously, you could kill an enemy without them making the death SFX by moving them _far_ offscreen (such as Y = -1000) or setting their HP to very large negative numbers. Neither of these seem to work anymore; the enemy will still make the death SFX. This was working fairly recently, but seems have to broken in one of the newer alphas, though I'm not sure exactly which.

"Very large negative numbers" does not do it
it specifically needs to be `HP_SILENT` from std_constants
```cpp

//NPC hit point values. Use with npc->HP to make the enemy die in a special manner.
const int HP_SILENT = -1000;  // The enemy will die without their Death Sound playing.
const int HP_GLEEOKHEAD = 1000; //Floating Gleeok heads have this as their HP value. ```

oh, wait, no, looks like lower negative vals might also work

....hmmm

Does that fix?

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 05/10/2022 12:23

Is this a hardcoded constant or one set somewhere in the std files? I ask since it may be helpful for quest makers to be able to disable that and just kill their enemies in other ways via script if they prefer.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2022 12:48

...?
that sentence does not make much sense

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 05/10/2022 13:18

emily I'm asking can I turn off killing enemies automatically if I move them far offscreen
for example z3 scrolling shenanigans
not that I necessarily _need_ that right now but I am wondering for future use.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2022 13:20

ahk, that has nothing to do with those constants
`npc->Immortal` is a thing to stop enemies from dying

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 05/10/2022 13:22

fair enough
also I just realized the constants related to HP not x/y position (which was the first thing Russ mentioned)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/10/2022 16:57

(replying to @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) "emily I'm asking can I turn o…"): There is an enemy flag for allowing them to move offscreen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2022 16:59

Does it *work*?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/10/2022 16:59

good question! no clue.
actually, why am I saying that
I know it works cause I had an offscreen enemy using that

=== @ Russ 05/10/2022 20:41

That build fixes it, yes
It also seems to run slower. I'm assuming some debug stuff left on?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2022 21:23

Not that I'm aware of...

=== @ Russ 05/10/2022 21:37

And now I'm testing again and no difference... guess my computer was acting up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2022 21:58

Fun
