Dumb idea I have for a script addition. (I dunno if it already exists)
But something like
Hero->ImmutableX
Hero->ImmutableY
returns link/hero's X/Y pixel position based on the entire map, rather than a given screens.
I know this is technically already achievable with basic math, but being able to *set* these values too could potentially be useful.

This is mostly good for things that don't use traditional screen based gameplay or need to do jank things, but I figured I'd suggest it.

That definitely sounds useful, yeah. Thinking of that drawn mode 7-ish ocean sailing thing I did that tracked screen positions based on the whole map doing the math- not completely sure if I'd have used ->ImmutableX/Y for that, but it's very close to what I was doing, conceptually

what exactly would setting these do?

I would presume read only

Oh, that seems insane
That wouldn't work

the screen checks to scroll you if you're a pixel outside the screen range

=== @ Mani Kanina 05/07/2022 17:38

ah
and you can't disable that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 17:38

that's how scrolling works

=== @ Mani Kanina 05/07/2022 17:38

yeah, fair enough
this is not very useful then
