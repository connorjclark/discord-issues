This just occurred to me and I think it would be great if this was an engine side feature but the default slash in Zeldaclassic is the GB Zelda 45 degree slash and it would be great as either a QR or sword exclusive item attribute to have 90 degree slashes ala ALTTP.

ü§¢ I don't want to think about the code required for this

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/24/2021 23:42

I see. My sincere apologies

iirc zoria planned to add this but we couldn't find the hitbox size for each frame even after asking on zeldix
i suppose i can ask on one of the randomizer discords nowadays
still it'd probably be hard since lttp had two different sword lengths that people would want
although as for scripting, isn't it much easier to do items now?

(meta) thread name was changed: ALTTP Sword

I did intend to add this and there is an lwpn for it ,  but as stated, I never found a complete definition for how it works in Z3

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 18:07

Thus, I left it on simmer.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 18:09

If someone wants to fully document the code for how Z3 handles slashes and the sprites and timing, then K could do it with a 1:1 conversion. I  do not want to implement a shoddy or inaccurate emulation of it in ZC.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/24/2021 18:10

not to mention i don't quite like the sword or hammer in lttp
small hitboxes

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 18:11

What you like or dislike is not in debate. I happen to prefer both over zc, but I was more used to both ere either *existed* in zc.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/24/2021 18:13

btw something you *can* do is port the variable length property of Z3 swords to the current sword
since iirc hitboxes for them are extremely hardcoded rn and don't respect the input value in the item editor

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 18:17

I could, but I won't.
If I am going to do tqt I want to do it all at one time, or not at all.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 18:20

Adding hotbox sizing to base swords is far from trivial
If I had all the metrics for z3 I would have done all of it for the z360 lwpn
Or z3slash
Or whatever I called it

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 18:22

Without the metrics and frame details, if fell to the bottom of my list. scripts allow implementation of it by anyone who wants to try and if they provide the script then  we could add I to future engine versions.
