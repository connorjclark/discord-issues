Dear devs,

I've tried out installing the latest nightly build on my work macbook and it is working well so far (I just wanted to check a few things, so haven't tried too much)

But I noticed that it is near impossible to use ZLaunch at first because buttons were displaced, until you uncheck the checkbox in my screenshot

Is it possible to uncheck that by default so new users won't be stuck?

Err the other way around, the checkbox needs to be checked and not unchecked üòÖ

should be fixed (checkbox is now ignored on non-windows, connor mentioned needing to do this at some point when I first added it but apparently never did so)
err, won't be fixed in the upcoming nightly though, because that's already building
so next one after that

Alright, thank you!

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 12:40

Now the issue always occurs because like you said the checkbox does nothing anymore.

Just a minor thing though, in ZQuest or ZC itself works fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 12:46

oh, er, what? that frankly doesn't make sense from what connor had told me....
should be simple enough to swap around
....but what if it's device dependent in some way

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 12:47

No it makes no sense to me either
As unchecking it before made it work properly, so it should work now when the checkbox does not at all ü§∑
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....but what if it's device d‚Ä¶"): Ah that is possible for sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 12:48

that doesn't help me at all
I can't test any mac shit
so
point being that if it's different by device, then the checkbox should be allowed to toggle, so I should revert the fix here.

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 12:49

Alright, fine by me
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "that doesn't help me at all"): sorry for trying ü´§

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 12:51

sorry, err, wasn't meaning that as rude, just trying to say I don't need you to give me any info, because there's nothing I can really do
also I'm pretty stoned

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 12:52

Ah alright üòÖ 
I must've misunderstood as I'm goddamn sober haha
Just 2 more hours üôè
Also if mac shit ever needs to be test lemme know
I'll probably play my own quest at least once on this god forsaken machine

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 14:48

Alright this is fixed again
Or rather, I can uncheck that checkbox again to fix it

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) as promised I would test the other issues on alpha 112. This bug does not exist in that alpha
