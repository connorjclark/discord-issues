I don't know if it doesn't work or I'm not setting it right, but the (Require Item) in the locked chest combo doesn't work for me.  I made sure the Item number is matched with the item acquired and the button set what I want it.

=== @ P-Tux7 07/17/2022 20:44

So you want a locked chest to require say... a Blue Ring, but it opens whether or not you have a Blue Ring. Right?

=== @ cbailey78 07/17/2022 21:44

That's right.  I wanna make custom items using the (Non Gameplay Items) dedicated for that purpose other than keys/level specific keys.  The required items in the lock block works.

=== @ cbailey78 07/17/2022 21:47

Especially making the Z2 rock road block that you press A or B to break once you acquire the hammer.

(replying to @ cbailey78 "I don't know if it doesn't wo…"): What do you have set, and what's actually happening?

=== @ cbailey78 07/18/2022 23:34

I have the (Use item and Item required set).  I have the "Held Item" number set corresponding to the item i made and the button I want is assigned to it.  It will not work whether I have the item or not.  That is without all the usable sides checked in the trigger tab because I don't have the "Can't use on sides" checked on the flag tab.
If I check all 4 sides on the trigger tab, it will unlock/open whether I have the item or not.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2022 23:43

the trigger tab has nothing to do with chests

=== @ cbailey78 07/18/2022 23:47

That what I thought.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2022 23:48

works fine for me
Is the item an `Equipment Item`?

=== @ cbailey78 07/18/2022 23:50

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2022 23:50

screenshots of the setup please

=== @ cbailey78 07/18/2022 23:51

This is a random spot to test

The hammer is set to (Non gameplay Item) as a custom item.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2022 23:52

coincidentally so was my test item that worked
oh, uh, one thing
Compat rules

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/998321143175975022/998739224461324298/unknown.png?ex=65e65ee2&is=65d3e9e2&hm=dd6ef206fea279b50a2686633adb94ba095e0782dc74ff1627f803eb60223d7c&)
Is that on?

=== @ cbailey78 07/18/2022 23:53

Oh, I'll check.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2022 23:54

Generally checking compat rules is a good idea *before* filing a bug report, for future reference; it's the issue often enough

=== @ cbailey78 07/18/2022 23:54

Yes, it is on.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2022 23:54

that means chests are using the 2.50.2 code
where none of the new options existed
soooo
I'd uncheck that
and try again
Generally, you never want ANY compat rules enabled when developing a new quest
`Quest->Options->Pick Ruleset Template->Bugfix` disables all of them, with some automatic handling for certain compat rules that need extra steps

=== @ cbailey78 07/18/2022 23:56

BINGO! It works!  The compat rules was the culprit.  It had alot of other compat rules checked beside the old chest one, so I unchecked those as well. thanks alot!

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅(Required item) in locked chest doesn't not work

=== @ cbailey78 07/19/2022 02:33

Is there a way to make locked chest open one chest instead of all of them when you have multiple locked chests on the screen?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2022 02:34

no
nor will there be
things that are part of screen are not available for expansion
screen states are how chests are tracked

=== @ cbailey78 07/19/2022 02:40

Bummer, thanks.

=== @ cbailey78 07/19/2022 02:49

It would been useful to use to have multiple locked doors for example Final Fantasy Mystic Quest on the SNES in the focus tower, you have multiple doors to unlock after beating a major dungeon.

=== @ P-Tux7 07/19/2022 04:27

I wonder if there could be a way to circumvent that by designating each chest combo as Normal, Locked, or Boss Locked, *regardless* of its requirements
In other words, think of the flags as Chests 1, 2, and 3, not Normal, Locked, and Boss Locked. Except in compatibility quests.
As we already have all three flags per screen

=== @ P-Tux7 07/19/2022 04:29

And to put three different items in the chest, that could be like the Signpost Combo's checking of strings
0: Special Item (current behaviour)
1-127: X item
-1 - -8: Screen->D[] 0-7
Mind if I make that as a feature suggestion?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2022 04:49

I'm not fucking with adding the requirements and shit to the other types

=== @ P-Tux7 07/19/2022 04:52

wait can't you just make the normal chest combo type identify itself as triggering chest, chest_locked, or chest_locked_boss

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2022 05:18

bleh
I really don't want to fuck with this

=== @ cbailey78 07/19/2022 05:20

Why can't you have the item required added to other types?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2022 05:23

chest code is a fucking mess
I just copied lockblock handling for locked chests

=== @ cbailey78 07/19/2022 05:24

I see.

=== @ P-Tux7 07/19/2022 05:31

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I really don't want to fuck w…"): who else would? deedee or connor?
