Request from OUCH! and Timelord to have a flag for Wizzrobes that chooses between the teleport style for Orange/Wind ones (that is, lined up with the player) and Bat/Summoner (randomly on any valid tile, respecting a certain minimum distance from the player). In other words, it is decoupled from their EWeapon style and moved to a flag. The ones in qst.dat are updated to have the correct flag set. Phasing Wizzrobes are unaffected, but this flag may find use there for something I suggested in the enemy rebalance thread.
The relevant code exists in the Emulation menu, it's just a matter of making the flag check for it.
