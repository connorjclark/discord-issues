Sword Beams do not change their graphic after being reflected if they originated facing left or right. Additionally, when firing downwards into a mirror, the Sword Beam will be positioned one combo above the mirror after being redirected.

The latter may be due to a newer rule for how mirrors and prisms work.
Not sure on the former. Is that new or in 2.53/2.50.x?

Issue was the "mirrors use weapon centre" quest rule

(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìWeapons reflect wrongly off mirrors.
