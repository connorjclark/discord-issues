At the moment, all custom item classes are simply called "zzNumber", which appears to start at 67. This can be difficult to keep track of what each custom class is for when creating custom items or setting up subscreens.
An ideal solution would be the ability to rename each of these item classes on a quest per quest basis, though it has been pointed out this would increase quest sizes and be a lot of work to set up.

One other (I admit silly) consideration is a zQuest compatibility option that when enabled, displays classes zz067 - zz 086 as "Custom Item Class Number" like it used to be, for those who preferred that method (plus older quests might have specifically used those item classes because of those identifiers, and would be confused by them being grouped with all the other zz classes now.
