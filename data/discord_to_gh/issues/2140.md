I would like to be able to just mouse on over to the combo pane on the right, left-click a combo, *drag*, and watch the little blue outline get bigger to encompass what combos I want. This inherently can't go wider than 4 combos at a time of course, but that's fine. Currently, the only way to paint large blocks of combos on a screen requires more cumbersome alternatives in the form of creating Aliases, FFCs, or constantly right-clicking to adjust the combo brush size or use the "draw tile block" options. Lasso functionality here would greatly speed up the process of drawing screens and offer a feature that *looks* like it should exist already, yet currently doesn't.

\* Dragging normally has the function of paintbrushing the combo in an area, which is used fairly often.
To allow this, it would be a toggle, presumably in the right-click menu of the main screen similar to brush changing, to swap to 'drag mode'
(meta) thread name was changed: Combo Pane drag+draw block
(lasso implies selection of something existing, not placing new combos)

Presumably,
`Drag Mode`>
`Draw Single`/`Draw Block`

Would be nice if there were like… a button or something we could press to change the bush size. I know right clicking and changing brush width and height exists but that’s so cumbersome I never use it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2023 14:16

...not sure how many keys are open

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2023 16:03

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "\* Dragging normally has the…"): OP is talking about dragging in the combo pane, not the screen area.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2023 16:06

Err, hmmm
That... Would make more sense, but be more difficult to make work

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2023 00:25

are the +/- keys open? or if not, shift++/-?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/25/2023 13:26

...csets

@ Zaidyer I think you'll like this

(nightly incoming with this, I left it off by default)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/28/2023 23:19

what do the various settings mean
the names might need a little clarification for the next release

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/28/2023 23:26

`ComboBrush` and `FloatBrush` always existed, with those names
I just added them to this menu
`AutoBrush`, means it automatically sets the width/height of the brush based on how you click on the combo panes

At last
Time to do some experimenting

=== @ Zaidyer 03/29/2023 17:34

Appears to work well so far, but I keep reflexively expecting to get a hover preview of what I'm about to draw, same as how Aliases work.
Also I'm able to draw blocks of tiles much larger than the old methods and that is *incredibly useful*
This will change how combo pages in tilesets are arranged for sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 19:50

(replying to @ Zaidyer "Appears to work well so far,…"): You can toggle that, that setting is called Combo Brush
(not new, feature from 2.50.2)

=== @ Zaidyer 03/29/2023 20:58

Wonder if it would be better to have these things enabled by default, since these days it's the "expected" behavior
And it's not immediately clear what they do, based on what they're named

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 22:57

(replying to @ Zaidyer "This will change how combo pa…"): How so?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:42

(replying to @ Zaidyer "Wonder if it would be better…"): done
