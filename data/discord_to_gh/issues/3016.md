if it wouldn't take half a rewrite, adding export options for normal formats would be nice. What do I mean by normal? Text. Plain text of some kind. Something that is easily workable externally. Why? 

Cuz the tileset I'm using got updated significantly and map importing is now useless cuz combos got shifted around. Thus, if map data could be exported as a text file with a list of combos and their positions, i could more easily update my map for the new combo list order. 

Either that or some kind of Smart(TM) Import that would solve this. e.g. changing combos on the imported map to match the host combo list based on matching tile graphics. <:clueless:1091804130261082132> <:5head:1091804640582041600>

Were combos shifting in the tileset unavoidable?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 06:04

Your idea to try to automate changing combos sounds interesting, but more useful if done as a "try up update this qst with combos from new qst".

But what if nothing is found for some combos

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 06:04

I didn't update the tileset if that's what you mean, but also I will answer this later gotta get ready for work üò≠

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 06:07

I was more suggesting maybe the tileset author needs to make less breaking changes so current users are able to upgrade?

If that's not reasonable then editor support is warranted

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 07:12

I feel like current tileset convention is to just cram everything together, whereas futureproofing by leaving huge gaps is not usually considered.

So currently if you wanna update a tileset you have to rearrange huge chunks because there's no gaps. And fragmenting categories of combos (e.g. cave, village) would be cumbersome for the user. 

Tldr I don't think it's common practice to make tilesets compatible with future expansion

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 07:14

Also yeah for my idea it specifically refers to importing maps. Importing maps from the old quest into the tileset update quest.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 07:35

but...wouldnt you rather just _update your quest_ to have the new tilesets combos,enemies,items,tiles,etc....
(basically, re-import all but map/script/strings/etc. data, and "do magic" to update combo/tile ids in use by maps)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 07:37

In any case, simply tweaking the tile of an existing combo (say, fixing a gfx mistake) would break this idea...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 07:40

> And fragmenting categories of combos (e.g. cave, village) would be cumbersome for the user. 

If this is the main thing preventing tileset conventions from being more friendly to future proofing updates, we can fix easily.

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 07:40

Yeah but wouldn't it be a pain in the ass to programmatically update combo pages. Unless new combos would all just get dumped on the end of the list

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 07:40

Just "collapse" long sequences of unset combos in the combo pane picker - then you can leave large gaps all you want.

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 07:42

Imo it seems less hassle to import maps and then fix the map during import but

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 07:42

Another idea - as a tileset is modified by inserting/removing/moving combos...save these movements in the qst so that they could be applied when upgrading an existing qst based on an older version of the tileset...
(replying to @ Majora "Imo it seems less hassle to i‚Ä¶"): maybe

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 07:43

Saving combo operations sounds sweet

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 07:49

But IMO that seems like introducing a not-worth level of complexity. The scenario I'm pitching is simple-ish (haha simple good joke) bits of automation strung together. with some user input in between to smooth out potential hiccups

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 07:51

I'm not sure about doing it specificaly for importing a map, rather than upgrading a quest with a new tileset's features.

Your qst is more than your maps. You have strings, QRs, etc...

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/26/2024 07:52

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Another idea - as a tileset i‚Ä¶"): The idea sounds absolutely amazing in concept, but it'd have to be an operation done IMMEDIATELY when opening that tileset for the very first time or you'll end up with a kronenberg or something.
But the quest designer would have to know that, first thing.

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 07:53

True, I guess this would suck for someone who started their quest in a tileset and it gets a big update when they're almost done

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 07:53

But I do see what you're getting at.... a way to adjust maps to accommodate for when combos move around and automating most of the mappings via looking at tile gfx. And for what we cannot determine that way.... a UI prompt to ask you to fill in the gaps.

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 07:53

I'm lucky and it got updated before I finished my first map
Although I question the wisdom of updating a nearly finished quest so drastically

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/26/2024 07:53

It's why I'm all for making tileset changes _easier_ rather than making a big package automation thing.   Like being able to copy and paste Aliases in the new combo page reform was a big deal.
I'm immeasurably grateful for the Devs for their hard work in ZQuest, but at some point the onus must be on the individual quest designer to be able to do things to make life easier.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/26/2024 07:55

Like the new suggestion I just made.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 07:55

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Just "collapse" long sequence‚Ä¶"): Would this positively effect tileset design / help avoid shifting combos around?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/26/2024 07:56

Ooh, actually, that _would_ be interesting.
Currently, it's offset by having to use Favorited Combos.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 07:56

please cc your favorite active tileset designers to this thread kthx

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/26/2024 07:56

To warp to those areas of the combo page.

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 07:56

It would have to be shoved in a user's face cuz I don't see conventions changing otherwise

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/26/2024 07:56

@ Phosphor - Spot of honor.
Immense amount of work in modernizing things.
@ P-Tux7  - Doing lots of great tilework for default quests.
(replying to @ Majora "It would have to be shoved in‚Ä¶"): Mm, elaborate please?  An interesting opening though.

=== @ Majora 01/26/2024 07:58

Ya it's cuz of phosphor that I made this thread lol. He made PTUS and then updated it. Which is whatever, I'm not putting any blame on him or anything, I just would like to update and the only real way to do that is to manually rebuild my one map it seems like.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/26/2024 07:59

I'm sure everyone has modifications they'd like to make to a tileset by default, actually.   I'd change the dungeon wall autocombos of theirs to actually work properly, for one.
They currently draw walls from the inside out, rather than the outside in.   Not quite how dungeons should work.
Individual checkboxes which are a heck of a change to automate making across the board, mind you.  I'd never imagine such minutia being added to an automation list like combo movements or something.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 08:13

Tossing out my 5th crazy idea

Give combos a unique ID, which sticks with it as it moves around. Kind of like a label, but auto generated, and unique. Then no guess work when trying to update to new tileset

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/26/2024 08:14

Hmm.  And you could have your scripts interact with that unique combo ID rather than by combo position number, as it is now, for the sake of mass-moving combos later.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/26/2024 08:14

Labels already serve that purpose

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/26/2024 08:15

True.  I haven't used them yet.
