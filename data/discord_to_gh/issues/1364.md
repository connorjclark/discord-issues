Not a big deal, but it was quite possible in all versions of ZC prior to 2.50. I'm not sure which 2.50 beta changed this, sorry, but I can confirm it happens in 2.10.

Can you make a video showing this?  According to LoZ canon, this should not be possible.

I can verify: ```
    case wSword:
    case wBeam:
      if(stunclk)
      {
        sfx(WAV_EHIT,pan(int(x)));
        hp=0;
        item_set = (misc==wSBomb) ? isSBOMB100 : isBOMB100;
        fading=0;                                           // don't flash
        return 1;
      }
```
The first public build in which it was fixed was 1425 (just after 2.50 RC2).
