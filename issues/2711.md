I would like to have the ability to have shallow water damage the player and I figured this suggestion would be the best way of going about it, there doesn't seem to be an option to have the shallow water combo actually damage the player and play the damage player sound hence this suggestion.

shallow water can damage the player already
it's in the combo flags
HP Mod

But there isn't a option for it to do so without knockback
and I don't think the hp mod thing triggers the hurt state or cause the player to play it's hurt sound

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "But there isn't a option for…"): ...shallow water damaging the player doesn't cause knockback
(replying to @ FireSeraphim "and I don't think the hp mod…"): there's literally a flag for whether it triggers the hurt state
