1.  Permanent clocks turn off on the next step of a raid battle.  (example, wave 1 you kill a Blue Moblin and get a Clock.  I shuts off when you defeat all the enemies and the next wave comes out.  Currently it does not do that)
2.  An enemy flag that makes enemies not respond to the clock at all.

So you want A: a way to turn off a permanent clock on the same screen, and B: enemies immune to the clock?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/11/2022 15:01

A.  Yes, when a round of a tile wave concludes, and B.  Yes
How possible is it?

I haven't looked into it, but I imagine pretty simple?
B is a weird one, cause I'm not sure how much I want to touch enemies before remaking the enemy editor
A, I'm unsure what best way to make it accessible would be
I could make the clock stuff visible to ZScript and allow a script to do it, that'd be simple (assuming it's not already done)

We can talk more tonight about it

B can wait until the enemy editor and enemy code is rewritten.  No real rush on that, it's the lesser issue.
A, on the other hand, can break Raid Battles and probably not something Emily saw designing raid battles forthcoming or me putting them together, and the only way out of it currently is to design enemies to either drop temp clocks or not at all.  It obviously needs a better solution.

If you get a clock first wave, all the enemies through all the waves just "stop" right there and the raid challenge is over

What about splitting invincibility and enemy stopping flags for clocks? I had to rescript time stopper clock from scrtatch due to inability to turn off hardcoded invincibility for default clock. LsiCV
