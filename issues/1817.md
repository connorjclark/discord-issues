did you try asking nicely
lol
Does it matter how you close it?

=== @ tim 08/18/2022 02:08

just used the x on both
zq did the same too

=== @ tim 08/18/2022 02:09

x invokes file quit anyway

yeah, I just started noticing this recently
thought (hoped) it was just windows being fucky with me, but with other reports of it, seems like an actual issue... great

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 02:19

this only started for me just now after I merged master to my scrolling branch. last time I merged was a few days ago IIRC
so this is something recent

=== @ tim 08/20/2022 02:24

not present in the 8/15 nightly

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "so this is something recent"): Your slow midi fix, potentially?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 02:36

It's the only thing since the 8/15 nightly that touches allegro stuff, except my most recent changes, but I noticed the issue before those

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 03:33

yup.
fixed
destroying threads on exit is problematic with how allegro cleans up. i think it's trying to join on itself or something. i forget. anyway, just not doing the cleanup is good enough as a fix.
"cleaning up" at program exit is a silly thing to do anyway
just...let it die

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅zc staying open in background after closing
