If Link is warped via the Autowarp combo, he will continuously autowarp even if the next screen he warps to does not have the combo present.

Yeah looks like that fixed it.
Although I've only replaced the ZC application. My computer couldn't let me replace zquest until I restart my computer.
But yeah I think that should fix it!
