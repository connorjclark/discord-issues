Just making a note to self because this has repeatedly bothered me.

Same request for Open Combo Page.

If you want this to persist across sessions, we can do that via the cfg file (like how the Test Init Data was done). No need to save in qst.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "If you want this to persist a…"): don't think across sessions was the request

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/25/2023 20:28

I'm adding to the idea.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2023 20:43

I would definitely have that be togglable as it would annoy me having it carry across sessions

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2023 14:07

Done.
(replying to @ Alucard648 "Same request for Open Combo P…"): Do you have an instance of it not remembering the combo page? I checked with both the combo list and favorite combos and in both cases it remembered.

=== @ Alucard648 09/29/2023 17:48

I mean Combo selector, when it comes with assigning combo to FFC or Secret Combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 17:48

(replying to @ Alucard648 "I mean Combo selector, when i…"): Ctrl click in most menus

=== @ Alucard648 09/29/2023 18:39

Does not work in Secret Combos Dialog.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 18:39

Aye, ctrl is taken there for something else
Thus "most menus"
Pretty sure that's the only spot that doesn't

=== @ Alucard648 09/29/2023 18:46

As for secret combos, I am suggesting to move flag assigning to Shift+Click, while Ctrl+Click should use new combo selecting with last selection remembered. As for original command, I don`t think, it is useable as it just cycles through combo table at uber-fast speed. And, of course, hotkeys documentation.
