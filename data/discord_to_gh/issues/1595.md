I'm merely bringing this over to a formal bug report 
`Speaking of which, I been wondering when you guys would take notice of a glitch that easily demonstrable in the intro dungeon of my side project. Enemies with the Tektike property eventually hopping upwards out of existence after a minute or two in interior dmaps (I have to think that might also apply to dungeon d-maps)

The Bit and Bot enemies in my quest kinda use Tektike behavior and it's the same behavior they have in the FYS tileset
Bit has random rate of 0, halt rate of 16, homing factor of 0, step speed of 25
Bot has random rate of 0, halt rate of 0, homing factor of 0, step speed of 50`
