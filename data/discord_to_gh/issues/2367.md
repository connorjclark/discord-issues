Lorem Ipsum is great for previewing text on fonts, but when using an editor like ZQ, certain symbols like `( ) [ ] { } ;` are just as important. Some fonts that look great with normal chars have kinda ugly symbols and it'd be handy to know ahead of time what we're assigning.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 08:43

sure lol, why don't you just edit it yourself

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 08:43

...is it just a text file?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 08:43

It's just a single string literal
in `src/dialog/options.cpp`
line 815
(found it in 2 seconds by ctrl+f'ing `lorem ipsum`)

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 08:44

ah. I can't compile the source currently and have maximum no time for getting around to that
otherwise I definitely would

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 08:44

you frankly don't need to be able to compile, as long as you don't typo it lol
or I can just make it easier for you
```cpp
fprev = Label(text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,"
    " sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim"
    " ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip"
    " ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate"
    " velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat"
    " cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id"
    " est laborum. Duis nec venenatis ipsum. Aenean sed malesuada velit. Vivamus"
    " eget cursus lacus. Pellentesque pharetra dui eget consequat posuere."
    " Quisque vel semper enim. In sodales viverra turpis eget dignissim. Nullam"
    " libero dui, rutrum id faucibus eu, eleifend nec mi. Aenean nec leo quis enim"
    " tempus cursus.",
```
feel free to edit this and send it back to me, and I can paste it in with whatever changes you want
idk if you want to just stuff symbols in or like actually try using them properly mixed with the words

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 08:47

or, hell, I can reformat it
```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. Duis nec venenatis ipsum. Aenean sed malesuada velit. Vivamus eget cursus lacus. Pellentesque pharetra dui eget consequat posuere. Quisque vel semper enim. In sodales viverra turpis eget dignissim. Nullam libero dui, rutrum id faucibus eu, eleifend nec mi. Aenean nec leo quis enim tempus cursus.```

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 08:50

I figured just a string of symbols. So like:
```fprev = Label(text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,"
    " sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim"
    " ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip"
    " ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate"
    " velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat"
    " cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id"
    " est laborum. Duis nec venenatis ipsum. Aenean sed malesuada velit. Vivamus"
    " eget cursus lacus. Pellentesque pharetra dui eget consequat posuere."
    " Quisque vel semper enim. In sodales viverra turpis eget dignissim. Nullam"
    " libero dui, rutrum id faucibus eu, eleifend nec mi. Aenean nec leo quis enim"
    " tempus cursus."
    " "
    " SYMBOLS: !@#$%^&*()[]{}+-=|\\<>,:;\"'~",```

You realize this tiny space is just a space, right?
(you would need `\n` to line break- this whole text has no breaks in it, it just wraps)

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 08:52

yeah I haven't formatted strings like that too often so I just made an assumption that that was why it was broken up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 08:52

nah, it was broken up for line length

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 08:52

yeah that makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 09:06

@ Moosh all good?
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106138869902102538/1106145413372850186/image.png?ex=65e983b1&is=65d70eb1&hm=b86cfea8bdd4af535a4cb3c159690147a621ff2f35eae0ed8ea6cc696394191e&)
ah, the `&` was a problem
(need to do `&&` instead for internal text, `&` is used to mark underlines)

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 09:07

huh
Oh I see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 09:08

aside from that, it look ok?

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 09:08

yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 09:08

ah, problem, it won't wrap between the symbols
I'll probably break them up into a couple lines
(they get cut off in larger fonts)

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 09:09

Oh true. Could do that, or space them all. Really any font where they go off the edge is probably too big for GUIs anyways, but presentation, I get that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 09:11

(This font is one I would legitimately use for the script buffer, as an example)
(but was failing to wrap the symbols)

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 09:13

oh yeah, this looks much better than what I had

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 09:13

I just removed the word `SYMBOLS` and split it roughly in the middle
....might still want to space them though

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106138869902102538/1106147466589515827/image.png?ex=65e9859b&is=65d7109b&hm=c38d08f696e2210f5b3109c811c527d0e82468b67794f77ecd6cf7a67a5fe574&)

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 09:15

Oh yeah that's way better

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 09:26

ahk, so, that was still manually line broken
I realized that it was actually not auto-line-breaking that low down, because it hit the max line count I allowed it to have...
which, uh, when I increased it, put the symbols text off the bottom of the window in that font
so, I trimmed a couple sentences off the ipsum text to shorten it

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106138869902102538/1106150532982259732/image.png?ex=65e98876&is=65d71376&hm=c9529327eb386ced1cd66c7139e26fc03cacb0d58420c220eb65500346fcd1e2&)

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 09:27

oof sorry
I really didn't think it'd be more than a 10 second one line change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 09:27

this part is me being perfectionist about everything I do
I could have just left it manually line broken

=== @ Moosh 05/11/2023 09:28

fair

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 09:28

but, that looks off to me, so I want it *nice*
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): which, this wasn't that bad to do, I'm just a bit stoned so it took me longer than it should have to realize the issue
and, this was something that should have been there anyway, to be fair

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 09:31

also, for the record @ Moosh , it was only this much of a change:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1106138869902102538/1106151693537775666/image.png?ex=65e9898b&is=65d7148b&hm=c11920b640cadb7f34735ed6f9643003b19dcb6290c53e42339859f67755d5ef&)
(`20` -> `30`, add the symbol text, remove 2 sentences of lipsum)
