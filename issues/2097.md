Again going to mention
as 109 has such terrible issues, which *110 did not have*
testing in any version 109 or earlier is effectively useless
unless nothing 109 or later works at all, in which case you would need the latest good build before 109

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:17

Those were just the ones I'd happened to test in at the time.  I'm happy to test every version between 106 and the current one if you want.
I have all afternoon.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:18

What happens in A111?
(not Nightly A111/112, actual A111)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:18

I'll load up the base A111.  Give me a few...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:19

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:21

...oh, could be related to #2091
fek

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:21

Heck, base Alpha 111 from 10/23/22 is perfect.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:21

How do you enter that screen?
Is it a warp?
If so, what direction are you moving when you enter the warp?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:21

Ah, I'll get it in ZQuest.  Oh, I'll try different directions then.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:21

Just answer
is it up

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:21

I've tried all three available directions in Alpha 111, and they're all good.
I'll try it in the latest nightly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:22

aye, I expect that in latest moving up will break and side will not
in which case this is a duplicate report of #2091

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:22

Actually there are lots of instances of this happening in the quest at the moment,
and even going down does the same thing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:22

oh?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:22

I'll try it in another warp.  Give me a moment.
Got rocks to lift.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/17/2022 21:23

I think Mitsu just drew the sprites as larger, it's still the normal hitbox

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:24

Here's another instance.    I'll give it a test.

Yep, this is one of them.

Lemme test it in the latest nightly.  If that matters...?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:25

So, was that working in A111?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:25

Base, yes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:25

then yeah, test all directions entering in latest nightly

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:26

Suddenly I'm having some luck entering that boulder one from most directions.  Continuing to experiment...
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053782490181029990/1053785393406951474/image.png?ex=65ecd420&is=65da5f20&hm=32bcd1d0404f1f2a2e84ae822df164df7b8841b8ecbc5a22a831088ad80b69f4&)
Going _up_ into that boulder hole is occasionally problematic, but not always.  But that pirate ship one from the original post **always** fails on the latest nightly.
I'll go back to that hole, now that I've got some weird success on this boulder hole.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:28

huh...

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:29

... I don't get it.  What changed.
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053782490181029990/1053785968588640256/image.png?ex=65ecd4a9&is=65da5fa9&hm=c3a4b4ebd2754aefa1d4779ee70c8a767c98ce15fe969d6a1c2d061095aa9661&)

_What changed._
The top screenshot is from a fresh quest.  The bottom is from where I'd made much progress.
I guess I Really do need to do a full replay or something.
... or not a fresh quest.  Just having quit and started again due to starting testing.
Grumble.
I'll see if it happens again later I guess.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:30

huh.....

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/19/2022 09:05

Bug still happens in this build.
Not saying a fix was expected - Just tallying dates and builds.
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053782490181029990/1054323510832529488/image.png?ex=65e58ec9&is=65d319c9&hm=4eeb214ba27b0f28629049bbf12a91bde3d4ec4738061d5a5529aded49e4b471&)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2022 05:38

It's more helpful to link to the GitHub release page, BTW.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2022 05:39

I don't want to look at the build logs to determine which of the two builds from that day this would be, based on the timestamp.
Was it this, with the input fix commit? seems liked it could be related https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2022-12-19-2

or was it the one before
(I need to add the "release tag" to the dialog...)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2022 05:43

Seems to be that one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2022 05:51

also, the ZQ dialog has a `Copy Report Info` button which just copies all of the information to the clipboard for you
....that includes quest-specific info for the currently open quest, so that doesn't *just work* by slotting it into ZC, though
@ Changeling you could probably open ZQ to get that info instead of taking screenshots

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2022 06:02

Wait... huh. I'm not running into it
and I'm noticing that there was another nightly that same night

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2022 06:04

give me a second to test the nightly beforehand (and check the date to see if that's the nightly they're using)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2022 06:08

Okay, seems like they grabbed the nightly before the latest (unless the newer one also has the same build date)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2022 06:10

Could you test it in the newer nightly Changeling? Sorry for the hassle

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2022 06:13

The bug with the link sprites becoming small sounds like some sort of array out of bounds or global script error happening somewhere, which would explain why it only happens randomly (at least, I assume it's happening inconsistently?)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2022 06:17

Which means tracking down A: what specifically is causing it (like if it checks for an item or if an array index is getting set improperly), then B: finding what's setting it improperly, then finally C: figure out what change would have broken it; a replay would be perfect for this, but I think the exiting sideview bug being fixed might break the replay if you're doing one currently? unsure

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2022 06:19

Basically, let us know if you run into the link becoming small issue at any point, and if it still exists in the newest nightly, I'll probably have to do full replay myself and hope to run into the bug

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/20/2022 10:11

Although I am 9/10ths through the game by now, (I'm going through the southwest part, on my way to Old Hyrule at present.)  would starting a new file and just doing the "Goto" potentially break things that might be needed for the replay?  It's a _loooong_ quest.  x X.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2022 10:14

I *think* goto cheat should work with replay? The problem is if you can reproduce it in the latest nightly
as long as you can get a replay that reproduces it, we should be able to fix it (assuming it's a new bug)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/20/2022 10:17

Keen, thanks.  I may have more time tomorrow than right now.  About to leave for work, but this'll be my top priority.

I do use rampant amounts of cheats to maximize my time, having limited quantities of it, so I hope that doesn't negatively influence things too much.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/20/2022 10:18

I also need to find a way to actually make a key file once and for all.  The check-box when making a password to make a key file only works when I say "It doesn't work."

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/12/2023 19:25

@ Changeling any chance you could try to repro this again if you have time?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/12/2023 19:26

In the very latest build?  Sure.  I'll see if I can remember to do this when I get home.  Thanks for following up.  üëç

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/12/2023 19:31

Yeah, the latest. Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
