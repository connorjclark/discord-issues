I can't pinpoint which build broke the string organization in my quest on the editor side but it's kinda distressing. The following screenshot explains it all. I had my strings organized by category and now it's a gibbering mess.

So I went to re-sort my strings out, I saved, took a break then went to resume my sorting efforts and now the sorting order is even more messed up!

It looks like it's just putting them numerically
weird

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/28/2022 02:17

Did you get a popup with something like this?

because if not, I have no idea what would be causing this

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/28/2022 20:31

I didn't see that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/28/2022 20:35

oh, fek
I see what's wrong
I'm a dumbass

this should fix @ FireSeraphim, though you either will need to load a backup from before it broke or re-order them again, as the issue did affect saving the quest file.

Thank You. I'll let you know how it turns out

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/30/2022 18:43

Sorry Emily, we're not quite out of the woods yet

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/30/2022 18:45

I think your fix is kinda incomplete because there's a desync in what the editor displays and what the actual game displays

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/30/2022 18:48

In this example string number 13 is supposed to goto string 14 but the editor says it's going to string 4

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2022 18:49

that's
not a bug
I don't think?
or
hmm
the `-->` thing is fucking weird
but, uh, this is not related at all
to the previous bug

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/30/2022 18:51

would it help if I just send you my quest's latest build so you can poke at it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2022 18:51

might

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/30/2022 18:52

gimme a few seconds

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2022 19:10

So, `The 7th thing in the list is Message String 13`
`The current thing is Message String 14`, and `the thing before this is the 7th thing in the list`, and `the thing before this is Message String 13`
all of that seems right
and then `The nextstring of MessageString 13 is 14`
. . . wtf

I know, right?

what the fuck

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/30/2022 19:16

I think I may have exposed a serious festering rathole of a problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2022 19:17

question; does it display correctly *in ZC*
because, methinks I just noticed something
...I think `nextstring` isn't the `index`, but the `listpos`
so, the question is, was that fucked up during string editor stuff (i.e. fucked up in zc too)
or is the indent here the thing that is fucked up
....Oh, fun, and I just found another unrelated bug

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/30/2022 19:35

It displays correctly in ZC
I actually tested that a few minutes ago

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2022 19:59

ahk
should be fixed
as should the other bug I ran into, which frankly was far worse

I'll let you know how it pans out

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/30/2022 22:40

Tested your newest build. It seems like there's no winnin' for losing here. The text displays like it should ingame but the editor is still being wonky on the next string box

On the editor side of things it's still showing the next string as 4 instead of 14 but it goes to 14 like it should ingame

oh wait
I see
I had this backwards
