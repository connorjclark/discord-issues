I notice you guys are kinda on a roll with new item implementation lately and I think I got one that I think would work great in classic styled quest. The Protect Bell from Terranigma. It would be a passive item that rings when you choose the correct direction in a maze path screen, similar to how it originally worked in Terranigma

A video that demonstrates the Protect Bell in it's original source game: https://youtu.be/G7N930A4pUo?t=28

I'll look into this

Any progress on this little thing?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/01/2021 20:30

No, because it's not a priority

And we need to get Alpha 100 out

Aye

Suggestions:
-"Error" sound as well for when the wrong path is picked and the maze resets, similar to Super Mario All-Stars. Does not play when using the "maze exit" (i.e. East in Z1 Lost Woods)
-Flag: Also Play Success Sound When Maze Solved (if set to off, only the screen secret sound plays a la normal Z1. If set to on, the success chime of the item plays in addition to the screen secret sound.)
Huh do mazes use their maze screen or destination screen secret sound... I need to test it

(I'm not planning on using Z1 mazes, but I figured this could use a more detailed spec for the implementation)

Still holding out for this one.
