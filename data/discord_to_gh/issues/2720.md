Clicking the drop-down arrow and opening the list of FFC numbers works fine. I have to double-click (or triple-click) to actually select a number in this dropdown (10-7 Nightly)

=== @ mitchfork 10/07/2023 20:51

Actually, this seems to be all dropdowns. They all require double-clicking
This seems to be less "unresponsive" and more "consistently require double click"
Happening with all of the NPC field dropdowns I'm testing (Weapon, Type, O. Anim, etc.)

Do we see this crazy clipping for newer dialogs, or just old ones? If just old not worth fixing

i assume some fonts the spacing works out, but for the default font it doesnt

=== @ mitchfork 10/07/2023 21:50

not new but I can report it separately

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 21:53

Yeah that's been around awhile
no need to open other report
for dbl click, code is here: https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/7a802180910d99ec2a83aa31a46bd609aa25d574/src/gui/jwin.cpp#L5322
it's a tricky change and (i believe) been this way for awhile, so I'll defer for after next alpha.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Do we see this crazy clipping‚Ä¶"): just old, becuase the old has no handling for using different fonts
they hardcodedly assume the font height, which, is wrong for the new default font, lol
all that indicates is that we need to new-gui that dialog at some point

=== @ mitchfork 10/07/2023 22:03

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "it's a tricky change and (i b‚Ä¶"): Might be. I'm updating from a pretty old version (2-22)
It was single clicks then. I know a lot of GUI stuff was reworked/unreworked in that time

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/01/2023 09:57

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "it's a tricky change and (i b‚Ä¶"): bump for me

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/01/2023 21:33

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "they hardcodedly assume the f‚Ä¶"): Can we change the default font for now, or at least just for these older dialogs?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/01/2023 21:51

I'm having no luck figuring out this old dialog code. Since this is pretty minor and we are going to totally delete hopefully one day soon, I'm going to leave this alone.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:39

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Can we change the default fon‚Ä¶"): the default font was changed for accesibility reasons, because one of the major complaints was font size being unreadably small

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:40

ok, then change just for these old dialogs.
they dont work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:40

we honestly just need to rewrite the old dialogs
they all NEED to go

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:40

We need a solution that will take 10 minutes
for 2.55
not 10 weeks
Do you know how to set a font for just these old ones?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:41

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è do what you need to I guess
no

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:41

Well _i dont know how_, do you?
mmmh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:41

not offhand at least
where the heck is this one?
there it is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:43

....well I figured it might be `large_dialog`
but that still only calls `font_lfont_l`, not the customizable font

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:45

....tracing calls to `get_custom_font` I see nothing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:46

in this particular case
it's not doing anything sane at all it looks like
it's just reading whatever the fuck font HAPPENS to be in the global `font` variable
for this specific case
(which, means this is a fix for this ONE dialog, this ONE set of text, and unrelated to anything else)
