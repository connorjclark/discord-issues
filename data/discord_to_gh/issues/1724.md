^Just idling the program on start up, no user input

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) ""): That's what blits to the actual screen, and updates the actual palette
so, would expect that to be fairly high

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 00:14

20% cpu still a lot, wondering whats going wrong where

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 00:44

once I dropped the two calls to it per frame
according to this 37% of the cpu used per frame with zquest just idling was this function üëÄ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/10/2022 00:48

wow

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 00:49

```
Remove excessive calls to `rebuild_trans_table` every frame of zquest.

    ~37% of cpu time when idling zquest was from two calls of this function
    per call to `refresh`. It was likely applied to fix a very specific
    issue with transparency not updating, but the real fix should instead
    be to update the transparency when needed on the appropriate user action

    We simply await for the proper user report to know exactly what to fix.
```
dats a good commit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/13/2022 08:18

reduced that function from 18% to 14% of total cpu time by just not rendering if `hw_screen` did not change... silly optimization but it works

=== @ Bagel Meister 07/14/2022 19:35

Nice! Isnt that technique called dirty flag? or am i dumb

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2022 20:36

Yuppp I even called the variable dirty_screen
