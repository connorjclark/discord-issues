A flag for the hookshot item: when makes contact with a liftable combo, pulls the object towards the player and automatically grabs and lifts it when it reaches them
Similar flag for boomerang too maybe?

So the dragged object would use its liftable sprite, right?

Would be the only thing that makes sense
Not likely to happen soon, but interesting idea

This should also have to be applicable to bombs too yeah?
