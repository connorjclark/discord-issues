Maye some players would like to have Whistles for different purposes (like OoT), where you have one to warp around, the other to warp to the beginning, others to just stun/kill enemies using music.  It would help having different SFX for each Whistle (that part is on us)

Yeah, good idea, it can make for an L1 and L2 whistle. Whistles have especially got good with level upgrades now that you can have levelled Whistle triggers and damaging Whistles

(Fun fact... you can set combos to be triggered by the whirlwind touching them for some reason. This would be a great way to hide a maze path in sand)
