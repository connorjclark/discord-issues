I was thinking that it would be really nice to have a new animation style for Gohmas, like for Elvis' Mothula. Here's how it would work
Row 1: Closed eye
Row 2: Opening eye
Row 3: Opened eye
Each row with 4 frames. And the vulnerable part is auto-calculated based upon the Gohma enemy's tile width, the middle 16 pixels.

This allows to have animated eyes, and for the leg frames to be different between rows.

I'll definitely take a look at this
