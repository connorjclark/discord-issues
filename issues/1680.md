Essentially:
lweapons->Weapon pointer is ignored by enemies.
Enemies still check lweapon->ID when determining damage taken / effect taken
an lweapon->ID = LW_ARROW
when compared to an enemy with [Ignore] for arrow defence will just ignore the projectile, regardless of what lweapon->weapon is set to

shields however, *do* ignore ->Weapon == LW_FIRE
as in fire weapons will piece/ignore enemy shields presumably as "intended"

Oh for fucks sake
@ Lunaria is the arrow in this case created via script, rather than an engine item?

here's a wonderful set of if checks
Note that the first one, if `w->parentitem` is `<0`, instantly RETURNS FROM THE FUNCTION.
So the `w->parentitem == -1 && w->ScriptGenerated`.... can never run.
this is SUUUUPER broken, and has been since Zoria added it. Time for a fix....

@ Lunaria see if this works?
