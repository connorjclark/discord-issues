As it says on the tin. This would trigger the combo when you dive while on it.

This is a SUPER good idea
never would have thought of it

=== @ P-Tux7 07/20/2023 03:42

needs to be moved to flags in the liquid combo since you can't dive on any other combo
but it is a good idea
i'd also ask for something that only triggers when you grab a dive-flagged item

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "needs to be moved to flags in…"): I mean.... how

=== @ P-Tux7 07/20/2023 03:43

so you can have items that appear to be underwater and an exstate that changes the combo after you pick them up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:43

you can dive on liquid, or dive warps, or etc, firstly
and secondly, triggers system is triggers system
....it would just be a flag that's not useful on everything

=== @ P-Tux7 07/20/2023 03:44

i don't mean combo flags i mean in the combo editor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:44

but, `Pushed->` is a flag that exists that only is useful on pushblocks
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i don't mean combo flags i me…"): ?

=== @ P-Tux7 07/20/2023 03:45

i'm not at my computer rn but don't combos have a flags section in the editor for binary settings that apply to that combo type
or is it only attributes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:46

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i'm not at my computer rn but…"): yes, but that's not based in the triggers system at all
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and secondly, triggers system…"): ^
and as for it only being useful on liquid combos
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "but, `Pushed->` is a flag tha…"): ^

=== @ P-Tux7 07/20/2023 03:48

that's fair

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:48

flags are single bits
adding them to every combo even when they are only useful on some, doesn't really hurt that much

Thanks

(`Dive->` checks x+8,y+8 while `Dive-> (Sensitive)` checks all 4 hitbox corners)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/08/2023 22:39

build posted
