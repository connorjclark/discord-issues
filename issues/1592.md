I know this is an odd one but I have a very good reason for it. In my current quest I have a room where you're awarded a Lv. 1 Wealth Medal after rescuing a prisoner, and the wealth medal comes with a letter (not the actual letter item mind you) attached it to. Now here's the underlying problem: I want to take advantage of the progressive item feature so that if you got the Lv. 1 Wealth Medal elsewhere then it will give you the Lv. 2 Wealth Medal for rescuing the prisoner and the SCC codes don't have one for only playing a follow up string if you're in a certain screen

I don't want to have to resort to a jank-ass solution when a better, less janky one can be added.

A screenshot of the situation in question where having "Goto if Current Screen Equals" would be a major godsend
