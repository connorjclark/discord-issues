Flag: Modern Ganon
```honestly if i had to reprogram ganon i'd just do something like "teleports x amount towards link by drawing a straight line to him and moving along that axis, and shoots, does this ad infinitum until hit, then respawns in random-ish location that won't telefrag link a la summonerobe"```
If the flag is used, his Step Speed is how many pixels each teleport takes him closer to Link.

Flag: Hold Up Triforce: On by default. If on, you'll do the intro cutscene thingy.

Flag: Drops Room Special Item: If on, he drops the room's Special Item instead of the Triforce (Whole). This is actually how it worked in Z1 - that was just his room's item.

Flag: Can Be Stun-Locked: If on, you can do that thing from Z1 where he has a few vulnerable frames between getting hurt once and rando-teleporting. If not, he will be invincible during this time, guaranteeing a rando-teleport.

Attribute: Teleports Per Shot: How many teleports he takes, and on the last one shoots, and resets the counter. This means that if you set it to 3, he'd teleport, teleport, teleport+make fireball, repeat. I realized that if he shot one every time he teleported you couldn't get in to hit him.

Attribute: How Many Death Knells: If more than 1, his HP resets once you shoot him (a la Z1 if you DON'T shoot him), one gets added to this counter, and he restarts his pattern. Once this counter is reached, shooting him will actually kill him. It was 4 in LTTP, for example.

Attribute: Death Knell Weapon Type: What you have to shoot him with to add a Death to his counter while stunned. Arrows by default.

Attribute: Minimum Death Knell Weapon Level: 2 by default.

Attribute: Teleports Per Visible: If you have a Ganon-seeing Amulet, every xth teleport will show him, and then he will hide again until the next xth teleport. (maybe a flag for this happening without an amulet as well?)

oh yeah, and i have no idea if it's currently hardcoded, but to avoid wasting an attribute let's just say that his stunned cset will be the one after whichever is set for him
so in the ESPs you'd put
-teal ganon
-red ganon
in that order

```Flag: Hold Up Triforce: On by default. If on, you'll do the intro cutscene thingy.``` this is tied to the Ganon room type

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 21:29

oh yeah, and obviously fixin git so that the ganon intro and ganon item ashes door open thingy is - uh
oh well ok then
of course the issue is that if you want a ganon without that you can't right now because... he won't spawn outside a ganon room lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/21/2021 21:29

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "of course the issue is that i‚Ä¶"): that's already fixed
as of 1 hour ago

WOW
you think it's OK to tell me to ZIP IT!?
triple banned!

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 21:33

yeah you really should be working on ganon some more

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 21:44

also you're REALLY gonna hate me for this... #1223
it sadly has to be fixed if we want to make Ganon a general, reusable, duplicatable enemy

=== @ P-Tux7 12/29/2021 17:27

Oh, it's just come to my attention that Ganon's explosion sprite is hardcoded in the location where it is on tile page 0. So it probably should be his Special Tile or an attribute.
