Title. Unless there's some critical reason they need to be set.

Conflicting controls.
Without them, every time I cycle items right, I would show solidity, and every time I cycle items left, I would start running at 8x speed
(w/q)
Default them being bound prevents these issues, and having the ABILITY to unbind them lets you remove them if you WANT to.

sounds like the issue here is that setting them every time you change zc folders is annoying

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so is rebinding all your controls
or changing any other settings
thus why copying your `.cfg` is useful
