=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/01/2023 23:02

When inputting keyboard input, such as entering a file name for "Register Your Name" or input read when `Game->TypingMode = true;`, very often it does not register an input. You may try typing in something like "LostIsle" and get "LstIse" after the dropped inputs.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/01/2023 23:03

zQuest seems to work fine, and all other keyboard input for gameplay seems steady (you don't randomly stop moving when holding an arrow key)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2023 23:18

Seems to happen with cheat keys as well

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2023 23:23

I'll look at this in the evening.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/02/2023 17:38

Looked at the case for when inputing a name. happens because every call to advanceframe will call allegro's `clear_keybuf`, which just drops key input. This has been around for at least 7 years.

Unknown if it's safe to drop this. It seems like only title screen and menu stuff ever directly call an allegro key reading function. So it seems like it'd be ok to stop clearing the allegro keybuf every frame. Will remove for now, and if it's an issue will add a way to just suppress it when registering a name instead.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/02/2023 17:43

I don't think it's that, input was fine in 12-15 for both File name entry and keyboard input in quest scripts.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/02/2023 17:47

True, there's an extra detail here. I added `update_keys` to advance frame during that time frame.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/02/2023 17:49

Which previously only happened in game, but now happens for every "advance frame" which included the title screens 🤷
Seems good from some testing, will push soon.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2023 01:47

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Seems to happen with cheat ke…"): I didn't check this tho.

Fixed for next nightly, building now.

=== @ Deathrider 01/03/2023 19:59

Awesome! Was having the same issue here where I had to spam ctrl+k to kill enemies and such

=== @ Moosh 01/08/2023 09:58

This bug still appears to be present specifically for scripts reading keyboard input

=== @ Moosh 01/08/2023 10:00

https://www.mediafire.com/file/eb1vbr6yot8wmgt/SSConnectionTest.qst/file
Here's a quest file with the dropped inputs

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/24/2023 01:14

Can confirm it still happens, though there's some oddity where it seems like the dropped inputs still effect replays and causes desyncs?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2023 01:43

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Can confirm it still happens,…"): Does this relate to scripts at all?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/24/2023 03:20

Yeah, scripts reading input
Stellar Seas's seed entering comes to mind

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2023 05:44

How have you confirmed that it's not also a problem for normal input? No scripts
I guess both you and moosh only noticed for scripts but I'm just checking how sure we are it's only scripts

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/24/2023 05:55

When I posted the bug the same kind of input drop happened for both Script Keyboard Input and Save File Name entry. The Name Entry seemed to be fixed, while the Script Input still dropped some inputs.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/24/2023 05:56

I assumed that since both seemed to have the same issue and started having it at the same time, it was caused by the same bug.

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2023 06:25

I haven't tested any quests extensively in the latest version, but the other stuff I'd expect to break (function keys, name entry, cheat modifiers, normal keyboard controls) all seem to work fine.

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2023 06:37

Okay I am noticing some drops on the F9 key in my multiplayer test still. That may be a special case though. It's doing a bunch of file read/writes every frame. Could those block F9?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 02:13

(replying to @ Moosh "https://www.mediafire.com/fil…"): excellent test qst, thanks!
i will now write my novel in this qst, keeping all typos created

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 02:27

butwhy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 02:36

@ Moosh bit sus

=== @ Moosh 01/28/2023 02:37

Dammit, it's because I forked the file from a passworded quest for the tileset

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 02:38

nah  you've got a commerical grade word processor here, of course you lock it down

=== @ Moosh 01/28/2023 02:38

or specifically...like 6 tiles 😛

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 02:38

i wanted to see the script, can you send that?

=== @ Moosh 01/28/2023 02:41

both these go in headeers

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 03:42

I believe I've fixed it. Will link a test build here soon.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 05:45

anyone around to give this a spin?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 05:47

I could try yeah

=== @ Moosh 01/28/2023 06:21

Gave it a try, script keypresses seemed to be working fine in both Stellar Seas and my ZLink test file. F9 key is sometimes dropping.
Anybody else experiencing the F9 thing so I know it's not just my keyboard?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 06:24

Great, just did a new nightly then. I'll look at the f9 thing later. is it any system key?
other Fs, tilde?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:29

(replying to @ Moosh "Anybody else experiencing the…"): yup, but only while playing a quest
it seems to work fine when paused or on the title screen or etc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:30

Also keyboard input seems to work fine; was taking a while cause I wanted a replay

=== @ Moosh 01/28/2023 06:32

Haven't had any issue with F1, F2, F3, F4, or F6
F5 is kinda hard to test the responsiveness of but I'd assume that one works too

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:32

which, seems to desync at first almost immediately after entering a seed in stellar seas the first time I try to load a replay, then immediately on loading the quest every other time I try to load the replay on that ZC session

=== @ Moosh 01/28/2023 06:33

oof
I am sorry for what my seed entry screen has yabba dabba done

unsure if I should link here cause this was in the version you linked here or if I should link in the stellar seas replay channel (the qst file has been updated since the other replays, so you'll need to download the one I just linked to try this replay)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 06:35

Deedee I already know system keys are iify for replays, I am currently just manually deleting tilde etc key presses
This isn't our issue here tho
Or at least, there's some other problem here that prevents us from using a replay to explore this problem

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:36

Yeah; I wanted to test keyboard keys though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 06:36

Iirc simply holding tilde will result in a replay that asserts

_other_ keys should work

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:37

which, they seem to work
just unsure why it'd be asserting immediately on loading the quest on subsequent tries

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 06:37

Is the JIT on?

=== @ Moosh 01/28/2023 06:38

So don't use tilde, F1, or other function keys when recording?
Was planning on doing a recording myself in a bit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 06:38

No need to avoid, I can delete

=== @ Moosh 01/28/2023 06:38

Ah cool

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 06:38

You just can't assert. But you can replay just fine
As long as you see it doesn't go wacko it's fine

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:38

nope, it's not on according to the launcher

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 06:39

Hmm I asked because I did see that result in an imedient rng desync earlier
Oh well

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:40

question: if I do "load replay" but not "load replay (assert)", will it still do the assert thing?
because it rng desyncs for me

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:42

frame 362, which looks like ```C 360 g C+7
R 361 3 3 12513129
C 361 g B9u
D 361 k 9
C 362 g HrO
C 363 g Cp]
C 364 g G`}```

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 06:42

It won't assert
It does stop when it finds the seeds are messed up

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:42

hmm

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 06:42

So yeah. I'll look into it more later
Sounds related to the thing I assumed was just the JIT messing up

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:43

Sorry if I'm pestering you with replay shit if that's not what you care about

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 06:44

I do care, thanks for letting me know
It's every time you load SS?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/28/2023 06:46

so it desyncs there the first time I load it up when I load up ZC; then desyncs frame 0 every other time until I close and reopen ZC

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/29/2023 23:44

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) does it happen in the upcoming nightly too? I wasn't able to reproduce it myself

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 17:37

So far it looks like this has been fixed, though there is something else amusing.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 17:38

When I first tried out keyboard input in 107, I'd press EX4 to toggle keyboard input mode. This also caused that key to be read as keyboard input, and I needed to add a single input buffer to not have my rando seeds instantly put a "f" as the first character every time.
I mentioned this, and it got quietly fixed for several nightlies, meaning I had to make the buffer build specific.
Well, that weird double input is back. Wonder if the dropped input was a side effect of this fix?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2023 18:54

How are you reading input? Can you share a sample qst/script?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 19:51

Actually, thinking about it. I bet Input->Press and Input->KeyPress check the "press" state independently. Let me add a Waitframe() quick to see if that changes anything.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 19:56

I don't really have a small quest that uses keyboard input (added it upon request to existing quests that had input for randomizer seeds).
But the meat of the input is within this scope.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 20:02

Okay, it's too big to post I guess.
But it starts like this `if (Input->Press[CB_EX4])
{
    Game->TypingMode = true;`
And then it checks for input like this `for (seedLoop = 0; seedLoop < KEY_MAX; seedLoop++)
        {
            if (Input->KeyPress[seedLoop])
            {`
And adding a Waitframe() after `Game->TypingMode = true;` does not change anything.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 20:06

But for a while, I think 12-15 through January builds, this quirk had been removed, and toggling TypingMode did not also read the Ex4's Press as a KeyPress.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 20:07

(my solution is to make it where the first keyboard input if ignored, in this case I set the "seedIndex" to -1, don't set a seedData[seedIndex] index when it's < 0, but still perform seedIndex++)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 20:09

Thinking about it, that means the 12-15 Nightly is where this quirk was fixed but Keyboard Input wasn't dropping (at least in the nightlies I have)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/14/2023 01:38

This?
```
ffc script Typing
{
    void run()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            if (Input->Press[CB_EX4])
            {
                Game->TypingMode = true;
                while (Game->TypingMode)
                {
                    for (int i = 0; i < KEY_MAX; i++)
                    {
                        if (Input->KeyPress[i])
                        {
                            printf("key: %d\n", i);
                        }
                    }
                    if (Input->KeyPress[KEY_Q])
                    {
                        Game->TypingMode = false;
                    }

                    Waitframe();
                }
            }

            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}
```

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/14/2023 02:11

- I did confirm that the fix for dropped inputs (`99f5fe`) did change the behavior here, from ignoring the input for that first frame to including it. Came down to `update_keys` in `load_control_frame` not being called.
- This seems to be the ideal behavior. It's the same frame, so of course the key corresponding to the button currently being pressed should be active too
- This seems like it was just a regression introduced since A111, although I haven't confirmed with older build yet. If that is the case, there's nothing to be done - it's working as intended and there would be no compat concerns.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2023 02:20

I don't mind, I have a workaround, I just want to make sure the need for a workaround is consistent, or at least know past Build X it will be consistent.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2023 02:21

Cause yeah, you could have TypingMode triggered by something besides Input, so being able to read keyboard-type input that first frame makes sense.
(I might just be one of the first to find that timing quirk and need to figure out how to work with it)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/14/2023 02:25

Makes sense.

Confirmed the expected behavior is what happens for A110 and A111, so I'll consider this done.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2023 07:27

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "(I might just be one of the f…"): For the record, you can read what keys the player's inputs are bound to
so if you really wanted to
you could set the KeyPress states false for all the control keys
above the while loop
to kill their input on the first frame

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2023 07:29

or, specifically the EX4 key, in this case
