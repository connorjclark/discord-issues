This alone does nothing, when followed by an Audio->PlayEnhancedMusic() it plays, but upon changing screens it plays the originally set dmap music.

.... @ Deathrider we're gonna need to debug this together, because I just went to reproduce this, and I can't. It works fine for me.

You might be able to try this, I didn't change anything to fix it, but it has some debug traces in it.

This evening if you have time we can look at it

Fun time though, I did just find a separate bug with enhanced music, and promptly fixed it.
(With windows midi patch enabled, tabbing out and back in stopped the enhanced music!)
(...it was checking if a midi was set to currently be playing, but not if an enhanced music was overriding the midi.)

This was filename length issue, as well as a script typo. No bug.
