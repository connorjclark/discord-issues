If you save (F2/File->Save), then the ability to save (outside of F2 which always forces a save to occur) is disabled until a change is made. The "Save" option in the File menu is grayed out. It also remains grayed out in the Favorite Commands section in Large Mode

After making File->Save gray out, performing an undo or redo will not un-gray/re-enable File->Save or Save in the Favorites Command section.

This is perhaps very minor, but Undo/redo should count as a change that re-enables non-F2 methods of saving.

ah, this. @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) add `saved = false;` when an undo action occurs.
