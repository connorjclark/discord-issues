Basically, when I created a new Manhandla sprite in Prototype 6F, the middle drew in 8-bit color.  But the hands drew in 4-bit color, C-Set 8.  Using old animation

...err
are the tiles of the hands 8-bit tiles?
because... if they aren't.... this would happen

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 02:29

Yes, the hands are 8-bit color too

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 02:48

Is Manhandle set to grab the hand tiles from a specific place in the tile pages th old animation
My understand is it's impossible to draw an 8 bit tile in 4 bit
So it must be that the Manhandla is not actually drawing those tiles

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 02:51

It could be hardcoded, I'm not sure

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2023 03:51

Oh wait it was, wasn't it?
That's why I switched 3rdEX over to New Enemy Tiles
So this is essentially that same bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 03:59

Anything related to old enemy tiles is probably not a bug
it's just bad

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2023 05:05

Considering that ZC allows you to manually select the tiles for both styles, I'd consider it to count as a bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 05:13

well unless it's a *new* bug, it can't be fixed without compat rule
and frankly.... why do old enemy styles exist?
like, what is actually gained by using them, other than just being there for compat?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2023 05:48

your guess is as good as mine lol
it once had a purpose to denote different starting tiles in 1.92/2.10 when New Enemy Tiles the quest rule had different hardcoded start locations for each enemy's tiles depending upon whether the rule was on or not
but i don't see why it was retained in 2.50 aside from making switching to new enemy tiles and back easier
it certainly comes off as rather wasteful to store the tile and animation style data in duplicate

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 07:07

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and frankly.... why do old en…"): Quests like New Quest and 1st Quest variants (even though dying out) still use old style variants even to today and have revisions with some new features; however, if we come to an agreement that it won't be updated, that's fine too.  I just think an OA needs to be officially made.  It's fair, people don't have to like it (including me), but it should be known.  If we want to make revisions we have to deal with it.  I'm personally not the biggest fan of classic new tile set (prefer Cambria if we are to upgrade), but if it has to be lived with then it just really has to be made public.  Just please don't say it's "bad".  People still use it.  "Obsolete" might be the more correct term

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 07:09

It's more work for the quest developer, but it is a fair move

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 07:11

> Just please don't say it's "bad".  People still use it.  "Obsolete" might be the more correct term
I've seen the code for the enemy editor that results from having to deal with two style settings like this. As a programmer looking at the code, *it is bad*.
Now, for my big question:
*What is actually the difference between old and new tiles*?

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 07:13

Old tiles were used for old enemy animations and for compatibility reasons

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 07:13

My assumption would be, mostly, the use of some hardcoded tiles with the old tile setups

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 07:13

New tiles were added to support more animation frames

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 07:13

aye

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 07:13

And not be hardcoded
Do you just want to make an official announcement and kill it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 07:13

Kill what?

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 07:13

Old tiles, say it won't be supported beyond what it is now
I'd be fine with that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 07:14

...what support has it gotten in the last over a decade?
what announcement is there to make
for what

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 07:14

Well, I know I still use it, I'm not sure if other people do and don't tell you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 07:14

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "My assumption would be, mostl…"): ^ My point is, I don't think this is a bug, I think this behavior is *an intended function of old enemy tiles*

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 07:15

Agreed, where can we discuss this then?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 07:15

(replying to @ NightmareJames "Agreed, where can we discuss…"): ....if agreed, then there's no bug here and I can close this?
and, what further discussion do you have for the topic?

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 07:16

The fate of "old" tiles in general

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 07:16

....I mean
they can't be *removed* without breaking compat
so there's not really any fate to discuss
literally nothing has changed here

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 07:17

Close this and DM me please

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 07:23

For the record
```cpp
else
{
    switch(misc&3)
    {
    case down:
        flip=2;

        [[fallthrough]];
    case up:
        tile=(clk3)?188:189;
        break;
        
    case right:
        flip=1;
        [[fallthrough]];
        
    case left:
        tile=(clk3)?186:187;
        break;
    }
}
```
That is absolutely hardcodedly choosing between tiles `186, 187, 188, 189` as the four manhandla heads
and 100% appears to be intended

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2023 15:17

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Now, for my big question:
*Wh…"): There's also a few weird hardcoded things with how enemies are set up, namely the following classes
-Moldorm
-Lanmola
-Zora
-Wizzrobes
-Aquamentus
-Dodongo
-Manhandla
-Gleeok
-Gohma
-Patra

=== @ NightmareJames 02/15/2023 15:25

I'm probably in agreement with Emily, as these would have come up in turn. 
 Best to just deprecate/obsolete the feature.  Good we talked about it.  Please close for good
