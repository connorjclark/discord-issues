Kill enemies in certain order. As seen in Bottle Grotto in Link's Awakening Level-2 as you have to kill a bat, then a Pol, then a skeleton to get the Boss Master Key.

You should be able to make various 3 monsters be fought in a chosen order. So i am thinking this could be a new kind of Maze room program thing.

This should be a script. Not happening in-engine.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "This should be a script. Not‚Ä¶"): Hold on there, this seems easy enough to add and I can see cool stuff being made with this.
