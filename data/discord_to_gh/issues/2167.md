```class foo{
    void foo(){
        b = new bar();
    }
    void PassThis(){
        printf("PassThis\n");
        Trace(this);
        TraceThis(this);
        b->TraceFoo(this);
    }
    
    bar b;
}

class bar{
    void TraceFoo(foo f){
        printf("TraceFoo\n");
        Trace(f);
    }
}

void TraceThis(foo f){
    printf("TraceThis\n");
    Trace(f);
}

ffc script PassThisTest{
    void run(){
        foo f = new foo();
        f->PassThis();
    }
}```
In the above example the trace in PassThis() and the trace in TraceThis() will be 0.0001, but the trace in TraceFoo() is 0.0000 instead

@ Moosh <:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>
so
when calling `class->func()`
it was setting the value of `this` to the new object, before it parsed the func params.
Moved a tiny block of code down like 20 lines
and it should be fixed
