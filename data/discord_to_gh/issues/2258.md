While in the ZC pause menu (with the blue tint and menu visible), F9 no longer does anything. Same deal when a script is hanging. Used to be I could hold the button and it'd catch the input every 10000 (?) instructions. This no longer works, and I have to kill it through task manager

I'd post a video but it'd just look like me staring at a screen doing nothing üòõ

Since what build

=== @ Moosh 03/25/2023 00:46

Will take a while to check. I only just noticed in the latest, but I also haven't been making scripts that hang for a while

That was a big one but if I were to take a wild stab at the exact commit that did it
```record key input, not just button input```
sounds like it could be related

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2023 01:27

.... The fuck though
I could have sworn I used it since then
Check the last A5 rewrite build before I reverted everything?

=== @ Moosh 03/25/2023 01:28

Also realizing the pause menu isn't part of the issue, I was just being a moron

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2023 01:28

(maybe it got fixed and then un-fixed)

=== @ Moosh 03/25/2023 01:29

(meta) thread name was changed: F9 hotkey not working when a script is hanging

=== @ Moosh 03/25/2023 01:32

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Check the last A5 rewrite bui‚Ä¶"): Does not work in that build either

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2023 01:32

Ahk, good to know. Probably a simple fix, but I'm far too tired tonight
Will take a look tomorrow

=== @ Moosh 03/25/2023 01:33

Sounds good. No hurry, take care of yourself, sleep well, ect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2023 21:35

should be fixed... but not in the nightly about to come out, that's already building and I forgot about this
it'll be fixed in the nightly after, which will probably not be too long
(today or tomorrow almost certainly)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/27/2023 19:39

(should be fixed if you can confirm @ Moosh )

=== @ Moosh 03/28/2023 02:58

oh yeah forgot to respond earlier, but fixed
