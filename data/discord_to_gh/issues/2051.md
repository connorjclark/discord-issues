After getting the blue ring in a normal game and saving, the save icon has Link carrying a strange shield, as opposed to carrying nothing in the original game.

I'm closing b/c I suspect the bug was related to something in restItems function which has since been fixed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/25/2022 23:23

if you see it again in a newer build let me know

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 23:35

You got that after blue ring?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/25/2022 23:44

yup
should link be white?
I suspect no, he should look like this after every completion of 1st->2nd.
since this is the new init data (just a sword)

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 23:47

yeah, should be blue
I haven't tested with 2nd+ quest, but just retested on Nightly 11-23 and still got the same weird shield
on the 1st quest
so, two separate issues maybe?
First quest he gets a weird shield that shouldn't be present and in other quests the tunic color doesn't change to match the ring?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/25/2022 23:50

In the NES game, he's blue?

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 23:50

yea
or red if red ring ofc

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/25/2022 23:50

Does he have ring on the new game too?
Idk what items are meant to carry over

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 23:50

oh, I get ya
no, nothing carries over
so maybe if you get the ring on that file, the icon will be incorrect again

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 23:58

as in he does turn blue, but gets the weird shield like on 1st quest

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/26/2022 00:00

Ideally we can match exactly what Z1 on NES does here. Has this ever worked exactly as expected?

=== @ Mega Moses 11/26/2022 00:01

yeah, 2.53.0 works as expected

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/26/2022 00:17

cc @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) who seems to have most recently touched game save icons

=== @ Tabletpillow 11/27/2022 23:31

Did you use a save file from a previous alpha?

=== @ Mega Moses 11/28/2022 05:26

No, this was a brand new save file.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/28/2022 05:35

I don't recall doing anything that would break; actually I don't recall much other than that it was something to do with the icon not updating on win game

=== @ Mega Moses 11/28/2022 09:52

super easy to replicate at least
just gotta buy the blue ring and save
