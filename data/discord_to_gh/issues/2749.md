We have a test for this, but it's been disabled since the subscreen rewrite: https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/872925

Report: https://tmp-resave-zc.surge.sh/

It must be something within readsubscreens / read_old_subscreens being different from the new version.

this is what plays in the original qst, its what does `C 88385 rand 32022` above:

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1163281300518617098/1163287395823800430/image.png?ex=65e523cf&is=65d2aecf&hm=f96256d431492b53b93925f3042fbe625bf176a8a9272a637d4dae07da43aa4f&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2023 01:29

is the `compat_flags` being saved?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 01:30

`SUBSCRCOMPAT_FONT_RAND` is set from `SubscrWidget::load_old`
so we should save this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2023 01:31

if you need the replay to keep working after a re-save, yes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 01:32

I think I'll hardcode something for classic_1st
Glad to confirm there isn't a real bug here. the resave test needs to be enabled, but this isn't worth saving to the qst file, so I'll hardcode a check here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 02:25

jk, not so simple to do that. it's just a byte, and may be needed for other things later anyhow.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 03:29

Fixed that, now extending the test to more quests we have replays for
freedom in chains shows a error on resave: https://tmp-resave-zc-2.surge.sh/
looks to be something re: enemies

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 05:30

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "freedom in chains shows a err…"): @ Moosh any pointers where to look here? anything QR related to enemy hit animation timing or hitboxes maybe?

=== @ Moosh 10/16/2023 05:33

On resave? That's a ghosted enemy being hit, so its knockback behavior should be completely rescripted

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 05:34

Yeah I resaved, but obv. didn't recompile any slots.

=== @ Moosh 10/16/2023 05:34

Does the resave check "Sprite Coordinates Are Float"?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 05:37

That QR is still disabled

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 05:38

I think this must be only graphical, as the replay continues on from here just fine.

=== @ Moosh 10/16/2023 05:39

What do yellow vs. red pixels mean in the diff again?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 05:40

That's just a visual representation of the color difference.
I don't recall, but perhaps it's literally the RGB color channels difference
er, no, it's smarter than that. idk
but they don't hold meaning other than "these pixels differed"

=== @ Moosh 10/16/2023 05:42

gotcha
```void __Ghost_UpdateFlashing(ffc this, npc ghost)
{
    bool endFlash=false;
    
    if(__Ghost_FlashCounter>=1)
    {
        __Ghost_FlashCounter--;
        if(__Ghost_FlashCounter==0)
            endFlash=true;
    }
    
    if((__Ghost_InternalFlags&__GHFI_CSET_FORCED)==0)
    {
        if(__Ghost_FlashCounter>0 && GH_ENEMIES_FLICKER==0) // Got hit?
            // 9-9-8-8-7-7-6-6
            this->CSet=9-(__ghzhData[__GHI_FLASH_COUNTER]>>1);
        else if((ghost->MiscFlags&1000000b)!=0) // "Is Flashing" flag set?
            // 6-7-8-9
            this->CSet=6+(__ghzhData[__GHI_FLASH_COUNTER]&3);
        else if(endFlash)
            this->CSet=Ghost_CSet;
    }
}```
If it's just visual I expect it'd be something in this block behaving differently

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 05:42

trying to find the code that cycles a enemy tile when hit
oh... it's scripted

=== @ Moosh 10/16/2023 05:43

Yeah that's what I meant by ghosted. It's using ghost.zh
And the flash animation is handled by that
as well as all movement, knockback, ect

=== @ Moosh 10/16/2023 05:47

Are emulation settings completely gone? I don't think there were any to do with script behavior, but the jank in this list would potentially change behavior if a quest was resaved in a newer version:

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 05:50

I assume that'd all be player-stuff only
prob been moved to QRs or simply dropped since 2.53

=== @ Moosh 10/16/2023 05:51

That's what I'd think

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 05:51

enemy data exactly same for this skele guy :/

=== @ Moosh 10/16/2023 05:51

Only reason I bring it up is that in 2.53 it enabled these based on version number of the quest file. So if something was still doing that...yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 05:52

QRs same too
(replying to @ Moosh "Only reason I bring it up is…"): oooh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 06:16

no luck so far. `enemy::takehit` does have a check for 0x250 but it's just for sfx stuff

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 06:28

`MiscFlags` (blinking flags) actually don't differ..
at least, not at the beginning of the frame
whats `__ghzhData`?
ah just global numbers

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 06:31

I wonder if the value for `__GHI_FLASH_COUNTER` is being preserved (or not preserved?) differently from a previous screen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 06:33

Oh that's done in a global script, so it should just always be around

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 06:34

this will be a fun one, might try printing out the exact commands run/registers read on frame 6779/6780
