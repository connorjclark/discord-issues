So as we all know the 256-colour structure of ZQuest prevents more CSets from being accessible to the user. I would be willing to redesign the icons so that they fit in one or two CSets

So first things first. How many colours are used by the "Themes"? If only ~5 I might be able to squeeze UI elements out of the other ~10 in that CSet, but if more I might need a second CSet yeah.

uhh themes use 8 colors?
from cset 15
all of cset 14 is used for a 'rainbow' of colors
which is used by things like placed flags
and cset 12 and 13 then are completely reserved in ZQ, for the colors on the minimap in the bottom left
....so what are you thinking of redesigning? at all?
there's just not any room

*shrug* deedee mentioned wanting to do it

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....so what are you thinking…"): the icons for tile warp, side warp, item location, etc.

well the colors those use are also used for placed flags
so that won't save anything
there simply is *no room*
The most you have is 8 colors (half a cset)
but
there's no way to save more
and 2 colors of that 8 are used as system black/white in ZC, so can't be used for anything else
