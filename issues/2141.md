Just as the title suggest, I go to run ZC and on a lark I decided to try playing a quest with my SN30Pro controller and it seemingly can only detect the B Button, the start button, the L1 button and the L2 button when I go to try to remap the buttons in ZC. Before all hope is lost I'm going to see how hard it is to edit ZC's configs to map the buttons correctly.

Given I _just_ updated how gamepads work in the latest version, knowing the version you're talking about is pertinent information
Also since I don't have this hardware, we'll need you to try old builds for us. When did this last work, if ever?

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:04

I'm running the latest build, but I suspect that Steam might be give me (and by extension you) a false positive. I'm going to try remapping the controls in ZC again, without steam running (I had steam running)
Nope, it's gotten worse. It's not even detecting a single button now\

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 19:05

Then it's a driver mapping issue, allegro just doesn't know about this device I guess. Would still like to know if this worked in older alphas.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 19:06

can you share a image of this page with the gamepad connected (you need to press something to have it show anything) https://gamepad-tester.com/

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:09

It detects it as something else. The manufacturers probably thought it would be easier to reuse xbox firmware for the controllers

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 19:10

And the buttons register when pressed?

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:14

Yes, although it should be noted that for some reason the L2 and R2 buttons seem to register as Axis2 and Axis5. But it probably makes sense since the L2 and R2 buttons are actually pressure triggers kinda like the Xbox's L2 and R2 buttons.

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:17

futher note, the SN30pro supports pressing on it's joysticks for an L3 and R3 button like both the Playstation Dualshock controllers and the XBOX line of controllers

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 19:19

now try https://allegro5.org/examples/examples/ex_joystick_events.html

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:19

I'm not getting any tangible results on that pages readout
I don't blame you if you want to tear your hair out at this point

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 19:21

ugh, they never updated the published example then https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5/pull/1326
try https://comfortable-badge.surge.sh/ex_joystick_events.html
which is my fixed version

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:24

your fixed tester is detecting my controller just fine now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 19:24

then my guess is that the web version of ZC should also work, can you confirm?
https://hoten.cc/zc/play
all things pointing to the allegro native gamepad driver database. web version use's SDL's instead which is better

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:28

yep, the web version detects my controller just fine

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:29

web version is not detecting L2 or R2
(again keep in mind that L2 and R2 and pressure triggers like on the XBOX line of controllers)

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:32

the web version button lineup is a bit weird in what it's detecting. It seems to regard the start button as an L3 imput

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 19:32

I fixed that last night but did not deploy to web yet
The tiggers, I mean

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:33

Aye

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:36

I've mapper Ex3 and Ex4 to L3 and R3 respectively and it's saying that R3 is a shoulder button of some sort. Might I also recommend "L.Should" and "R.Should" as a way for the Input menu to refer to those, and what the hell is guide?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2023 19:36

These names are from the SDL database for this controller driver ID
we don't set them
this menu needs some TLC wrt spacing but ... whatever

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:37

Aye

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/28/2023 19:40

Web version is frozen on me right now, especially after causually loading a quest in it. This is proving to be one hell of a rabbit hole

hit that copy url and share the link

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/29/2023 00:31

Too late

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/29/2023 01:24

At least tell me what the quest was

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/29/2023 04:41

Bob's Quest 2
