Just another long-term request to improve further development expierence, similar to subscreens.

I mean...
.... There's a reason we haven't tried this already
The tile editor in particular is pretty ok (as I've already added a lot to it, as it is)
Grabber I will never touch with a 50 foot pole
Tile/combo pages as a new gui dialog *could* work with a widget for the actual pages, but like... Not sure how much that would help

If you have specifics, please make a separate thread for each with a suggested UI / what the pain points are of the current UI.

I'll mark this closed as being too broad, but happy to talk more about specific ideas in their own threads.
