Maybe this as a combo type? Going down would be dead-easy; just add to the Y and the Z by the same amount- sideways/up would be harder, and probably take some fancy doing.

needs to have the same push-against sensitivity as Z1 push blocks or secret walls at least to avoid accidental jumps

Was this ever added, Emily?

nope
there would be discussion here if it were
with screenshots and stuff
and the channel would have a checkmark
and be closed
