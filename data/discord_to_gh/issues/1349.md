In Screen flags 1, you can have an option to have the lens either reveal or hide a layer. If set to "reveal" a layer, the layer will be hidden by default and will only be revealed by using the lens. If set to "hide" a layer, the layer will draw *unless* you use the lens, in which case it won't.
For some reason this feature completely broke in 2.55

```if((!type && layer==(int32_t)(basescr->lens_layer&7)) && ((basescr->lens_layer&llLENSSHOWS && !lensclk) || (basescr->lens_layer&llLENSHIDES && lensclk)))``` this line is the culprit; changing ``!type && layer==`` to just ``type==`` fixes it
You're the one who made this change though and I'm not sure what you were trying to do with it

...``(basescr->lens_layer&7)`` is equal to 0
so it'd run if type is equal to 0... was this bugged the whole time?

oh, no, the old code used type as a layer but with a -1 offset
okay, fixed it
