`Old Conveyor Movement` compat qr, when disabled, use new movement code (`movexy`) for conveyor movement, using the corner-shove code (with hardcoded value instead of init data's value) for the `Smart Corners` handling. This fixes the jankiness of FFC-smart corners (which do not work currently at all), and improves the movement handling in general.
