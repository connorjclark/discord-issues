Russ pointed this out to me just now, since I never actually use these by the buttons. if you lightly tap them it zooms down the list faster than is humanly usable

doesn't seem that fast to me?
maybe a *little* faster than would be liked, but definitely not *zooming down faster than humanly usable*
one quick click does 1-3 items worth of scroll
*oh*
but it like, speeds up as you hold it down longer it looks like?

here's what I'm seeing. It takes like two frames to go from top to bottom and I'm not sure if the buttons are even being pressed or if it's jumping to the mouse's position like when the bar is  being dragged

(replying to @ Moosh "here's what I'm seeing. It ta…"): takes about 7-8 *seconds* for me in that same exact dropdown
