Shot Types:
-1 Shot
-3 Shots
-5 Shots
-Breath

Shooting Type:
-Random Head Shoots (default)
-Every Head Shoots In Unison
-Every Head Takes Turns Shooting (may be too hard to implement)

Flag: Fiery Heads Block All (NES accuracy)

Flag: Does Not Create Fiery Heads

Flag: Breath Fireballs Count As Boss Fireballs (they're hardcoded to be normal fireballs; see also #1203)

Flag: Longer Firing Wait (intended to be used for Fire Breath Gleeoks; I'll time how many frames it takes for the breath to disappear later so I can give a number that this should be)

I'm also interested in the "Unsigned Homing" feature request so that fiery heads don't have a chance of cornering Link.
