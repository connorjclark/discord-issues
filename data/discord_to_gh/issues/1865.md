As this screenshot can attest, zscript absolutely refuses to compile the script and I know I have all the required components in the correct folders. I haven't even changed anything other than adding a minor fix to lejes's wallmasters script.

Oh yes, ZScript fails to find std.zh

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) ?

Funnily enough
all of the recent commits to the repo
have *passed their compile tests*
which *includes a script compile of std.zh*
something is very fucked up here
and I haven't touched anything parser in a fair bit
I mean, there's the arrays in ZASM stuff, but your compile isn't getting anywhere near far enough to even be running that code
that'd be in the `Building` pass, not `Preprocessing`
also I recently used scripts to test something
so, it has to be an EXTREMELY recent change
@ FireSeraphim here's a question
Screenshot `ZScript->Compiler Settings` for me?

I'm curious if your include paths are blank or something
because the `include/;` there is necessary to find std.zh
and `headers/;` and `scripts/;` should also be there by default

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) ?"): what?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/15/2022 22:21

@ FireSeraphim / @ Alucard648 can you provide when this last worked (please, go check old builds, it helps a lot when filing bugs.)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 22:22

It works in the build I have locally
which would be after my most recent commit
so one of your 5 commits yesterday must have done something?
unless it's inlcude paths

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 22:24

in which case I wouldn't have noticed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/15/2022 22:24

Those commits are very unrelated.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 22:25

as I haven't done a fresh build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 22:27

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Those commits are very unrela‚Ä¶"): pretty much everything I've done lately is also VERY unrelated
so I really don't know what any of our commits could have done to cause this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 22:56

hmm, so that doesn't look like the issue then?
oh
OH
uhhhh
.....except, I don't have the issue
That's a fresh download of the latest nightly, and it works fine
@ FireSeraphim cannot replicate the issue
please screenshot your include paths

I swear I did not touch the path settings at all

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/15/2022 23:07

also I tried filling those paths in with the exact wording in lejes's screenshot yesterday and I still got the same end results

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/15/2022 23:09

just now tried typing in those directory words in the compiler settings and still the same end results

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 23:14

...try redownloading the nightly fresh?
because when I downloaded it it was filled in, and compiled fine, sooooo

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/15/2022 23:20

I did that yesterday

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 23:22

I legitimately don't know what to tell you
unless you can give us more details, there is nothing at all we can do

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/15/2022 23:26

Apparently doing that again today worked.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/15/2022 23:28

I think what happened is that my header or scripts folder in zc got slightly corrupted or something
