it barely caught it visibly in the video, sadly, as it's such a small flicker
it's most visible right near the end
while moving the mouse, it occasionally flickers out, and appears slightly off to the side; this occurs whenever there are black bars due to resizing not to scale, such as when maximizing.

something is not quite drawing the mouse at the right position, but only occasionally, and only for approximately a frame before flickering back to the correct place.

Does it happen without that recent mouse hide change
The mouse is meant to be drawn in the larger Fullscreen viewport and stretched into the smaller fake canvas thing we have rn
Hence it doesn't line up
It works ok when you can't see the real mouse lol
This may become simpler/go away with hardware mouse so should try that first before getting to deep on this bug

yeah, hardware mouse is probably the solution
