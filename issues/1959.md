I think we should have a quest rule that gives you the option that doesn't stop the music once link goes into the cave tile.  The music continues until you warp to the next dmap that has a different music and the music will instantly change.

There's a FR elsewhere that suggests a composable feature set for a new fully configurable warp type. Just another approach to do the same.

Cool!
I would love to take a peek into that feature
