Since the render refactor that happened in nightlies between a111 and a112, when you save the game, the player now pauses (tints to blue like you clicked the screen) and says "SAVING..." in the lower right.  I would like to disable this for in-quest saves, and return to the way that it was before where saving didn't have any special graphics. It breaks the immersion for quests that use a particular palette/color restriction like Peril of Rectangle Country

:sigh: the problem is that when saving the palette glitches the fuck out sometimes if that isn't done

is this some allegro 5 thing?

=== @ mitchfork 04/06/2023 04:39

Bleh, I seem to recall that now

oh wait or did old zc just disguise that by always saving on a black screen (F6 -> Save)
so the palette screwing up would be "invisible"

=== @ mitchfork 04/06/2023 04:40

no, this is something related specifically to the render refactor
because if you did a scripted `Game->Save()` in a111 or below, it would just pause with no overlay or palette glitch

yeah, the thing here is it doesn't know the difference between `Game->Save()` by scripts, and save+exit via engine
it's needed for the save+exit by the engine, because otherwise the palette fucks up
....it shouldn't be needed on Game->save
but I don't know how best to make it handle that

=== @ mitchfork 04/06/2023 04:46

ah, I see
yeah, that's really the only case that I care about it.  It happening while exiting it fine, it's just jarring when it happens at save points
