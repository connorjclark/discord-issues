Okay so this is a bit of an ambitious one, potentially requiring touching all collision code, and I'm unsure if this is more of a feature request or a dev note for a plan that might be attempted; A special layer that you can give an X and Y speed, and it'll draw that layer at an offset that constantly increases by that X and Y speed, looping through (think a mist effect)
potentially this layer could be many screens wide so there's more to loop through
where this would get really fancy though, is *collision*

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/13/2022 21:52

imagine placing spikes *on* this layer, and wherever the other layers above it have holes/combo 0 on them, this layer's collision would be active
and now you have a sort of background layer that moves with spikes you have to dodge, or warps you have to avoid, but only while standing in certain parts of the floor that reveal this layer

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/13/2022 21:54

Where this layer would be drawn and what layers it lets "block" it would be customizeable
as well as whether it has collision at all
it could potentially even *move* you
I'm thinking of calling this the "conveyor layer"
The complicated part here; do I want solidity to be usable on this layer?
If so, I'll need to look into solid ffcs and solid objects and figure out *how* I want them to move you

oh
my
fucking
*insane*
Definitely sounds like solid FFCs/NPCs would be something to do first
which, are something we really want added anyway
(for the record, for npcs, you should have a function `bool enemy::isSolid()`, which is used for checking solidity- that way multiple things can make an enemy solid, such as being frozen solid, or having a script flag set)
(and the one function can handle that instead of needing to change the checks in 100 different places)
....good luck friend, ambitious ideas

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/13/2022 21:59

Thank you
going to look into solid objects soonish

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 21:59

would probably make a separate FR thread for keeping track of solid ffc/npc talk

Please don't do anything like this until I merge Z3 scrolling
Which would make me very sad
Shouldn't be far away from that
Just kind of imagined it would be a huge conflict

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/13/2022 23:19

Yeah, I don't think I want to start until I can get my hands on Z3 scrolling and make sure it plays well
How does your Z3 scrolling handle FFCs anyways?
cause there's 32 per screen but there could be multiple screens worth of FFCs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 23:21

I doubt it handles it fully in any sane way, given that most of ffcs purpose is script-related
and connor didn't touch most script stuff

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/13/2022 23:39

I've been deferring ffcs
and for script, I've introduced new instructions to deal with extended combo positions
but there is the unavoidable your-script-must-upgrade shiz
new instructions was simplest (for me); may be able to do better, but I'll leave that to someone else to attempt

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 23:41

yeah, z3 scrolling + scripts is gonna just be a complicated mess
and no matter what 99% of old scripts just won't work on scrolling screens
the important part is making sure they still work on normal screens, lol

=== @ P-Tux7 12/02/2022 21:45

it would be neat solely as an untouchable visual effect, imo
for both the mist layer thing and parallax as you scroll the screen (or screens in the case of a room-by-room quest)
