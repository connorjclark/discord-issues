Feature... mostly works. I'm not happy with the polish, and there's still some things missing

oooooooooooooooooooh
Very pomising
~~what can possibly go wrong with rough draft in-engine swimming. Never caused any problems in ZC for overhead swimming~~

=== @ P-Tux7 10/25/2021 17:15

oh yeah
do we have air bubble and water splash effects
just ripped some from mario 3 last night for alucard's 2.50/3 classic sideview engine, i'll upload them later

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/25/2021 20:28

We actually don't v.v I wanted to have splash effects for entering and exiting, but I didn't know what the best way to do that would be
Especially since you can enter from any 4 directions and presumably the splash would be larger than 16x16

=== @ Mitsukara 10/26/2021 06:31

would it be possible to create a LW_SPARKLE to do it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/26/2021 06:45

definitely not what we would want
it would be a decoration, like shallow water splash and tall grass

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) so
how do shields work underwater

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/01/2021 21:16

Uh, good question
At one point they didn't, but I'm not sure if I changed that

=== @ P-Tux7 12/01/2021 21:17

ok someone was asking do we need to have the shield be visible in the sideview swimming sprites in tilesets
or can one just copy the shieldless link swimming sprites
so that's why i asked

=== @ P-Tux7 12/01/2021 21:21

so hrm
maybe it should be a setting in the liquid itself?
because even though you can't see it, lttp actually has shields in effect for top-down water as well

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/01/2021 21:22

the LTM still changes IIRC

=== @ P-Tux7 12/01/2021 23:31

mm yeah i figured but it would mean no new graphical work
just paste the shieldless swimming sprites on every page
