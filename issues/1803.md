what is that door
because that certainly does not look like an NES dungeon door

It's a gb style lock door

so, it's using a lockblock combo type, is what I am asking?
you can't just tell me what it is from a design perspective, you need to say what you are actually USING to do that in order for it to be useful information for a bug report
My guess is, it's a lockblock on a layer
which I just fixed a bug with like, 2 days ago
if it isn't a lockblock combo on a layer, then this is a separate issue; but I need to know that to be able to do anything about it
