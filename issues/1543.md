I feel like this would be a quality of life change seeing as how cave/item cellar is rarely used and mostly everyone i talked too said to use insta-warp, but it would really make the process streamlined

the thing is
the default warp
is the warp type which has the value `0`
because.... everything gets zeroed out

o: well if it'd be too hard to implement i'd understand XD i just thought that'd be a decent idea especially for newcomers who don't fully understand to make it easier!
