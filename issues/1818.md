as of right now in ZC (pre-existing enemies included) there's a max total of 511 enemes that can be customized and edited and I would appreciate having that number bumped up to 999 at the very least.

Paging @<role: Developer>s

Don't ping us every time you make a bug report or feature request please

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/19/2022 14:19

Aye, sorry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/19/2022 20:59

and please do not ping `@ developers`, that includes more people than just deedee and I
but like, seriously
if you make a feature request
I will see the unread notification
the next time I check discord
so unless you're reporting a bug that breaks LITERALLY EVERYTHING and THE WORLD IS ON FIRE, pinging everyone is kinda a bit overkill
