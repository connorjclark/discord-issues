I've only been playing it for a couple minutes and ran into a couple things, then i added items with cheats to see what else was up...
-shield doesn't push urchin enemies
✅ -on certain screens, certian strings play when you pick up items, and since some strings are tied to items(specifically trading sequence items), the player also gets the item (Fixed)
-some sprite errors (sword beam break effect, ball and chain's chain)
-the candelabra only shoots two flames instead of three

these are all the ones i found so far.

```-on certain screens, certian strings play when you pick up items, and since some strings are tied to items(specifically trading sequence items), the player also gets the item```
wait slg had that issue in mystical harps (which was also a 2.50.2 quest converted to 2.55)

=== @ Guinevere 09/02/2021 06:38

i see
good to know

=== @ Guinevere 09/03/2021 00:09

-bubbles after they finish their spawn animation stop moving/bouncing

=== @ P-Tux7 09/03/2021 00:13

are these diagonal bubbles?

=== @ Guinevere 09/03/2021 00:27

ye

=== @ Guinevere 09/03/2021 00:28

-guma's sometimes shoot straight projectiles with no set sprite instead of their "bolas"

=== @ Guinevere 09/07/2021 05:00

-coppies copy the direction the player is facing but not the movements

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 20:17

(replying to @ Guinevere "I've only been playing it for…"): hover boots in this quest?
Looking through the quest file and script file, I don't see any hover boots item given to the player at any point ever

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 20:18

yeah i forgot to remove them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 20:19

> -if you hold the jump button on the second jump with the roc's cape, and have the hover boots, you fly up higher than you're supposed to

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 20:20

yeah that's my bad

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 20:21

i cheated in all the items (i thought) were in but i forgot the boots weren't an item in the quest.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 20:24

`-the candelabra only shoots two flames instead of three`
Are you sure it's not spawning 3, but 2 of them are overlapping?
(If you have `Log Game Events to allegro.log` enabled, the console will show every time a script creates a weapon)
`-on certain screens, certian strings play when you pick up items, and since some strings are tied to items(specifically trading sequence items), the player also gets the item` This should have been fixed a while ago, was reported in other quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 20:30

What's wrong with sword beams? I don't see any issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 20:35

the urchins.... definitely are broken, and I don't see why at all
ffs

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 20:42

I know that the item pickup bug was fixed
the sword beams screw up only when link is auto firing
and it could be that the candelabra is shooting three shots but two shots stop right away and the third trails off normally

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:37

(replying to @ Guinevere "-coppies copy the direction t…"): new player movement or zfix related perhaps?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:38

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "are these diagonal bubbles?"): this could be similar
worth testing in builds prior ro adding these feats

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:40

http://timelord.insomnia247.nl/zc-dev/2.55/
i tried to mae change backtracking easy by archiving every build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:41

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "new player movement or zfix r…"): definitely not new movement, as that would require the quest be edited to enable a previously nonexisting qr

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:44

use cheats, try it in old builds th work forward
coud be soe wrie zfix thing
coud be anything
itested it in a build 2 years ago
never noticed those specific issues
also
please list open isues and not ied issues
would help
if you get a st saved to where it is eas to test thes bugs sain a20 then yo can repeately test each build thereater an chec changes

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:49

i advise jups o 5 builds to expedite narrowing the build range where te bug occurs
My apologises in advance i I did something awful

=== @ Mitsukara 11/05/2021 21:16

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Looking through the quest fil…"): They're not hover boots, although they are called such in-game.  They're a custom scripted item (I _think_ in one of the Custom Item Classes?) that prevents the player from falling into hole combos (and gives them protection from stepping on spikes with a regular "boots" item).

=== @ Mitsukara 11/05/2021 21:18

my apologies for not actually participating in 2.55 testing myself, rendering LaZPoC halfway into the realm of abandonware (neglectware?)
but if anyone has further questions on this subject I'd be happy to at least attempt to help answer
at some future time when I have more of a windows 10 setup (or if a new 2.55-or-above Linux version comes out) I'll try to actually test the quest myself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2021 21:23

@ Saffith can probably compile a linux build for you to test with, though it won't have any sound (that's currently the main linux issue)

=== @ Mitsukara 11/05/2021 21:27

oh? Well, no pressure if it'd be difficult, but that could be neat if it's easy to do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2021 21:33

as far as I know compiling it (without sound) should be as easy as compiling a build for windows... just, saff is the only one with the linux build setup, considering you need a linux machine
well, or a VM, but we don't have that set up

=== @ Mitsukara 11/05/2021 21:35

hmm, I wonder if you can compile from within a flash drive boot of Linux, without needing to make a permanent installation

=== @ Mitsukara 11/05/2021 21:37

(the way Mint and most other versions of Linux work, you just format a USB flash drive to act as a boot device, and you can run Linux from that even without a permanent installation to a hard drive. I opted to install on my hard drive as well, but you don't have to do that to run Linux)
(it was pretty fast and simple)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2021 21:41

I mean, I don't see why not
the main issue just being "bleh, needing to set things up? Lazy..."

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/05/2021 21:52

The issue for me and getting linux is that i only have 5gb of space left on my main drive and im too lazy to vlean some of it out

=== @ Saffith 11/06/2021 03:33

Yeah, I can get something together. There are a couple of crashes I've been putting off dealing with; I should really do that first.
Sorry, been pretty lazy lately.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 04:03

No problem <a:hugheart:884673091878391828>

=== @ Mitsukara 11/06/2021 04:10

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "The issue for me and getting…"): that's part of the beauty of having a boot stick. No hard drive space needed, just a USB flash drive
also that's totally fine, I appreciate that you're working on stuff at all

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 11:32

(replying to @ Saffith "Sorry, been pretty lazy latel…"): Youve been a godsend recently, theres no pressure!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/29/2022 21:41

```-shield doesn't push urchin enemies``` Fixed

=== @ P-Tux7 01/29/2022 22:04

i dunno if you wanna detail it in the thread but i'd be interested to hear what the problem was in DM

=== @ P-Tux7 01/29/2022 22:07

Also, another quest worth looking into would be her 6th quest, since it uses much of the same ZScript functions. If it has bugs, fixing one there might fix it in Panoply. It can definitely clear your mind and make you realize a solution if you have two projects you can go back and forth between instead of focusing only on Panoply.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/29/2022 23:33

```-some sprite errors (sword beam break effect, ball and chain's chain)``` Fixed, Zoria was a dumbass and hardcoded default weapon sprites when the weapon creation code handled them based on item ownership and etc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 15:08

``//step = (type<2)?.5:0;`` Okay so see this
```-the candelabra only shoots two flames instead of three```
The thing that sets the default step for fire weapons is commented out
So script created fire weapons got changed to default to 0 step instead of 0.5 step, without regard for what this would break
thanks Zoria

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 15:35

I'm unsure if this is  abug or intended; autofire damage seems *really* low
lemme boot it up in 2,53

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 15:42

Okay, no, it seems intentional
I mean, they are level 1 stats

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2022 22:11

It's really annoying trying to debug issues introduced in early 2.53

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 19:26

```-guma's sometimes shoot straight projectiles with no set sprite instead of their "bolas"```
Fixed this; o_tile was for some reason changed to not be correctly initialized with script weapons, which would cause o_tile to either be the value of a previous weapon or random values, which tricked scripts into thinking that the weapon had been dealt with and made into a bola when in fact it hadn't

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 19:28

```-shield doesn't push urchin enemies```
```-bubbles after they finish their spawn animation stop moving/bouncing```
```-coppies copy the direction the player is facing but not the movements```
all of these are fixed, as they were the same underlying issue
and both```-the candelabra only shoots two flames instead of three```and ```-some sprite errors (sword beam break effect, ball and chain's chain)``` were fixed, as detailed above
granted, I have not yet checked the ball and chain

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 19:31

I'm going through the entire game and fixing stuff as I go

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:05

god, it's a pain to search through quest strings
I wish there were a way to force sort them by their number

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:11

...give me like 5 minutes.
and I can give you that in 2.55

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:42

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) pushed
that took a little more than 5 minutes, but, it's pretty cleanly implemented

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:42

ooooh
thank you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:42

`Sort` will sort everything numerically
and when you sort, it takes a copy of the order it was in previously; and makes `unsort` pressable. `Unsort` will restore the previous order.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:43

It's purely visual, right? It won't fuck with the actual order?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:43

It does fuck with the actual order
there isn't a way to do it visuallyu
without completely rewriting how it works
but, `unsort` will put it back in the order it was in before you `sort`ed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:43

will it still save the order even if you go into a message string and then go out?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:43

yes, but not if you close the dialog

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:44

alright

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:44

...actually could probably make it stay even through that easily enough
hmm
one moment
oh wait
no
because that would persist even if you changed quests
bleh
yeah, so just be careful not to close the dialog if you intend to unsort

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:46

So, uh
I'm running into a very weird pickup issue
```int32_t shop_pstr = 0;

                case rSHOP:

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:48

oh uhh
I see what's wrong
`PriceIndex` is `-1`
so it's reading `[-1]`, out of bounds
probably grabbing the price of the 3rd item

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:48

ahhhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:48

the entire `switch(tmpscr[tmp].room)` needs to be inside an `if(PriceIndex > -1)`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:49

```if (PriceIndex >= 0 && PriceIndex < 3) ```?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2022 20:49

`>-1` should be sufficient
it will only ever be -1, 0, 1, 2
#1345
that'll be fixed by this

=== @ P-Tux7 02/01/2022 20:53

oh is that what slg was reporting

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 20:57

Well, she did respond with "random items" instead of "shop items"
but I need a clarification

=== @ Mitsukara 02/04/2022 00:50

so hey, sorry I haven't been keeping an eye on all this. Feel free to ping me if there's questions in here that I miss

=== @ Mitsukara 02/04/2022 01:00

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "```-some sprite errors (sword…"): ...this reminds me of a more general weirdness I noticed a time or two, in 2.50.2, which I never checked if it's still in newer versions or how best to prevent it, but, sometimes when you created a LW_SCRIPT(number) weapon, it would, for one frame, have weapon sprite 1 (wooden sword) pointing north, before the graphic was set? Not sure if that's still a thing, or something I was doing wrong, it's been a long time since I poked at any of this
to the point where I'm not confident trying to post a bug report, but it might be an issue that existed, or exists

=== @ Mitsukara 02/04/2022 01:02

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "I'm unsure if this is  abug o…"): ...I might've been incompetent somewhere, I don't think it was supposed to be level 1 damage at all times? I mean... _maybe_ that made sense but it sounds kinda weird. I would think if I was nerfing it I would've gone for half-damage, or like, one level behind or something, like literally like, a flat level 1 damage no matter how much you levelled up.
Then again I defaulted to liking things tanky so I might not've even noticed and thought about it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/04/2022 01:03

(replying to @ Mitsukara "...I might've been incompeten…"): I was at level 1 at the time; it just seemed like Link was doing half the damage Zelda was doing as a partner

=== @ Mitsukara 02/04/2022 01:03

OH
okay, I think Link might have weaker swordbeams that match Zelda's arrows when he's a partner, yeah
I think that might've been part of the attempt to make Link suck less since there was a general consensus it was always better to play as Zelda
so that the actual sword does more damage when you're using it directly

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/04/2022 01:04

(replying to @ Mitsukara "I think that might've been pa…"): wow, you should have gone the opposite approach
should have given them a gust jar so they could suck *more*

=== @ Mitsukara 02/04/2022 01:05

Make Link completely useless?

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "god, it's a pain to search th…"): Sorry about this. I share your pain, and regretted a thousand times that I had changed the order at all
Another really, REALLY good sounding quality of life feature to be able to resort them now, thanks for that!

also, thank you both more generally for working on all this stuff
