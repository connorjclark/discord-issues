I was attempting to make a "Pressure Plate" sort of combo.  Emily wisely assured me that a "None" type combo with the "Step" and "Triggers Secrets" properties would work just fine. (And they do!) along with a Combo Change. 

The crash within ZC itself during test mode occurs after stepping on it __while the "Secrets->" button is on__ in the "Other" tab as well.  When that's unchecked, the pressure pad works.

@ Changeling does this fix it?

Tested myself and confirmed, is fixed.
