This ruleset can used to just apply all rules relating to ZScript fixes to your quest.
There are a lot of tiny rules which relate to small ZScript fixes being added by 2.55, which can be difficult to keep track of. This aims to standardize script settings for modern quests to reduce the likelihood of running into snags caused by the odd fix or two not being set or unset correctly in scripts.

`Modern` should do this

=== @ Moosh 03/29/2022 04:15

The issue there is that it sets _all_ rules, when the script and bugfix ones are continuing to expand with the editor and quests made in older builds might want to standardize them
While still keeping gameplay rules unchanged

Like say I boot up New BS 3.1, looking to make an old school quest with mostly Zelda 1 rules. But I also want to write scripts without emulating bugs that have long since been fixed. I'd be greeted with with this:

And then a bunch more in the script rules menu

As someone who's stumbled into the issue before already I'll usually know which rules I have to check or uncheck to fix things that break. But new scripters will have to contend with things like...item scripts just not working at all because they're emulating 2.5 where they only ran for one frame. Ew.

=== @ Moosh 03/29/2022 04:27

So what I think would be nice would be a button above Pick Ruleset called "Standardize Bugfixes" or something of the sort, and it sets all of these save for maybe NES fixes (those are their own category because of some people's nostalgia after all) to what they should be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/01/2022 01:01

For the record, all `compat` tab rules should be cleared by ANY ruleset

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/01/2022 01:30

OK so

Rulesets will set *every single rule*
Rule *TEMPLATES* will specifically set/unset some rules, while leaving all other rules alone
Check multiple to apply multiple
`Bugfix` unchecks everything in the `Compat` tab
`ZScript Bugfix` sets script-related rules

This includes quest-based compiler settings, but will NOT modify config compiler settings (still need to set those yourself)

if you find any rules are missing, or can think of any other templates to add, feel free to mention that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/01/2022 01:38

for the record, it's this simple:
