w/ `7fb3e48ff fix(zc): improve main menu responsiveness` I noticed that CPU usage when menu is open (just click to open system menu) ~doubled, to ~40-60% (!) of my mac.

uh oh
probably something simple missed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/26/2023 17:42

rest(17) -> rest(1) likely.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 17:43

mm, yeah, that was needed to make it not feel like it was SUPER laggy though
maybe a more middling value

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 17:46

tile editor stuff uses `rest(4)`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/26/2023 19:59

maybe `throttleFPS(60);` instead

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "maybe `throttleFPS(60);` inst‚Ä¶"): do you, like, wanna try this and see if it fixes your issue?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 08:40

do you not see a really high cpu % too?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/09/2023 08:42

no, I don't
just about hits 1.5%
2%
back down to 0.7%
so, that's about what I get

do you notice any latency with this patch?
passing true ends up calling al_flip_display, which triggers hardware vsync
so this drops the cpu usage

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/09/2023 08:59

will check in a bit, trying to debug the parser-opt branch still atm

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 06:47

bump

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 09:15

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "```diff
diff --git a/src/zc/z‚Ä¶"): making this change causes my cpu usage to more than sextuple (~1.5% -> ~9.5%)
so certainly does NOT "drop the cpu usage"

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 09:15

I'd expect al display flip to rest during vsync...
Does your monitor somehow not have vsync
Or maybe it is like a 120hz??

hmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 09:16

its a tv screen so

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 09:16

I don't know if that makes it more likely or not lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 09:17

i have no idea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 09:30

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "maybe `throttleFPS(60);` inst‚Ä¶"): How well does this handle the issue for you?
`throttleFPS(60);` in place of `rest(1);` still works cleanly for me
with cpu sitting still at ~1.5% - 2%

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 06:42

ya that worked
