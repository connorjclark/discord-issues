AFAIK Currently there isn’t a way to efficiently or effectively import enhanced music into the quest file, except maybe through dmaps, but Idk if that even completely bakes it into the qst file it might just be a filepath. It’s not like we’re saving space or anything by having it outside the qst file as it just moves it outside, which just adds another file needed and the potential for filepaths to mess up. It would be nice if we could either update the midi system to include enhanced music, or just include a new system for it. I realize this might be a big ask but it seems really necessary at this point.
I also realize that updating qst files may also increase chances for corruption but I don’t really understand how that all works so….

this will not be ever happening
it increases the size of the file too much
to the point where PZC would not want you hosting the quest there (there's a reason they require music to be hosted externally)

(You CAN use a `package`, using `Export->Package`, which bundles everything in a folder for you)

is lossless compression out of the picture?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/24/2023 02:30

Music formats are already compressed.

The reason not to add big data files to the `.qst` is that we need to read the entire thing into memory and parse the qst file before doing _anything_. So adding 10s MB of music files (Yuurand is 700MB...), which aren't even needed to start the game, is an unacceptable slowdown to startup time.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/24/2023 02:32

Can you describe your main struggle w/ having the files alongside  the qst file? Are you unsure where to keep them, or how to reference them, or how to distribute them?

=== @ Alucard648 10/24/2023 08:08

What about smaller audio formats, such as NSF, SPC, VGM/VGZ etc. ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2023 08:08

still would require creating an entire system for loading them that's specific to those, and support that ON TOP OF the existing system...

=== @ Seboops 10/24/2023 16:51

I tried referencing them via strings but I worry that if I export as an exe then it might break
because it's very hard-coded

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2023 16:52

(replying to @ Seboops "I tried referencing them via…"): When you export the exe, it gives you a whole folder to put assets in
Just put your music in a subfolder (which you'll need to create) named `music/`

=== @ Seboops 10/24/2023 16:53

I do "NameOfQuestFolder"/"NameOfMusic" because I put everything in a separate folder
when I'm making it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2023 16:54

If you're doing the exe folder you can just do `music/`, because it's in a folder ***only for that exe***
So, it's already in a folder with your quest name on it
(and `music/` is one of the paths that is automatically searched for music files)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/24/2023 17:32

As long as the music files are next to the qst, or the exe, or in folder named "music" next to either qst or exe, it will work
By just referencing the filename (no folder)
For exporting package, You'll need to manually copy the music to the extra asset folder tho. That could be improved. See docs/packaging.md
