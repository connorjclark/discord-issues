Something like in Link stuck in Castlevania.
Hoping it does not require complete rewriting.

Not happening until the rewrite, in-engine
just, by god, painful code
BUT

=== @ DergerSwerson 08/25/2021 03:45

much love for this idea though

@TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) made a ramps script recently that works fucking beautifully

=== @ DergerSwerson 08/25/2021 03:46

you know ive often wondered... what if trick scripts could be implemented into the engine and at a user level, it would seem like functional engine stuff

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2021 03:49

not without rewriting everything
what you are describing is called a sane system
which zc is not

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 08/25/2021 04:20

Yeah I still uhhh
need to finish it technically
however
most of it works
could be rigged up to work in a quest with most functionality.

I should post the latest code when I get the chance to.

(replying to @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) "I should post the latest code‚Ä¶"): Feel free to post this in purezc.net forum under Sripting discussion section.

Actually... I think a QR that lets Link step up small steps in sideview would be dead simple
I'll give this a look once I'm done with Sideview Swimming (which is still pain btw!)
