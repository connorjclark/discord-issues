Even as a "bunny", Link can still swim with the flippers regardless of if they are tagged as usable as bunny or not.

^ This is probably an issue with most passive items.

I jsut checked and yeh he can also still push heavy blocks as a "bunny" with the power bracelet even when it's disabled too.

just waiting for full replay tests to run before merging, but, should be fixed
(I just updated it so every single thing in the source that was calling an item check, now is checking for bunny by default- previously it was NOT checking for bunny by default...)
(then, had to update the subscreen checks to ***specifically*** not check for bunny, as you don't want them just unequipping on you when you get bunnied...)
