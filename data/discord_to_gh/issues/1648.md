Flags for the Whimsical Ring to work for
-Swords
-Hammers
-Wand Melee
(When importing previous quests, all three flags are checked)

In Myst Isle the hammer's supposed to have boomerang-level power but the Critical Ring messes that up.

I remember requesting something like this for attack rings, it would be neato if all "stat rings" had flags for specific items

=== @ vlamart 05/27/2022 17:12

Or an attrib similar to the shield and blocking where only the sum of lweapons are affected

=== @ P-Tux7 05/27/2022 17:28

Attack Rings might be problematic - what items' attack do they increase? Critical Ring per-ring items only work because Critical Rings only affect three items to begin with, so there's enough flags to handle each one

=== @ vlamart 05/27/2022 17:30

You're right, I'm confusing lweapons with item classes

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Attack Rings might be problem…"): the attack ring is literally a copy of the crit ring
they affect the same things

ah good
so it can apply to that then
(meta) thread name was changed: Whimsical and Attack Ring Expansion
