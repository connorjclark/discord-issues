Dash/bonk sprite (already reserved). Charge up by using, and then run in a straight line; if a sword is owned, it will be held out in front.

Needs bonk triggers (i.e. dash rocks)

Plenty to do to get this working...

I think breaking pegasus obstacles tends to make small particles fly away (similar to the ones when you throw a lifted object)
