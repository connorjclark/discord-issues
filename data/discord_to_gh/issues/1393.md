Additionally, grabbing palettes is more annoying. Previously, when you grabbed a cset, pressing down would move down to the next line, letting you hold your mouse over grab to efficiently pull them in
Now, pressing down just scrolls between done and preview in cs 9

(replying to @ Russ "Additionally, grabbing palett‚Ä¶"): Apparently this isn't something that can be reasonably added
But you can press G and that will do what you want just fine
