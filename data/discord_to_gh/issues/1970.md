Instead of dropping set items, can we make lid table combos drop from an item set, like bushes and grass do?
(meta) thread name was changed: Liftables use item sets

What is a "lid table combo"

=== @ cbailey78 10/17/2022 19:11

He probably meant liftable combo.  Probably a typo

Probably.  I'm just having a tough time visualizing what this request actually is with the way it's phrased.  It's something I think pictures would help with.
For example, bushes and grass drop from an item set?   If an "item set" is the Item Drop Sets like what enemies drop or bushes/pots drop when slashed, how do you get a liftable combo from that?
I'd quote something to form relevance, but the entire request is a single sentence and nothing more, so I'm struggling a bit to comprehend this one.
