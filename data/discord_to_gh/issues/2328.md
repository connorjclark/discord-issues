Here's an enemy trying to walk off screen with the flag off. It seems to think there's a barrier on the right and bottom 16 pixels

And then with the flag on. It can go through the right and bottom 16 pixels but still won't go offscreen

For a couple maybe relevant rules, `Enemies Can Go Out of Bounds (Offscreen)` is on and `Can Use Items/Weapons on Edge of Screen` is on as well
So it's not that a rule is forbidding the enemy from going offscreen as far as I'm aware. There's no 2.10 enemy barrier either
And regular walking enemies can walk into the bottom right 16 pixels just fine (they can with scripted movement too although they get stuck on the screen edge)
the function being used here is `this->MoveAtAngle()`
And the example quest I've used for other such enemy bugs once again showcases the behavior

OK, so
the 16 pixels was just an error on my part when I fixed the big problem
easily fixed
and move through screen edge?
You'll recall I mentioned a sanity check being false that should have been true?
Well duh, it should be true or false based on that flag. Easy fix.

Ah splendid
