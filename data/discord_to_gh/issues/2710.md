Setting up the auto combo UI to be like a tile page but with placeholders could make it easier to understand how to set up auto combos

Using a UI like this, in addition to supporting assigning multiple tiles I think would make it far easier to set up auto combos, especially for complex mountains

Suppose in that image that the transparent mountains were the presently unassigned tiles.

I could help by drawing some low texture placeholders, but the DoR mountains would probably also suffice as placeholders
this also could apply to all of the other auto combo types
this also makes the "Auto Generate" feature less necessary IMO

(replying to @ colin "Suppose in that image that th…"): I mean, there already are placeholders though?

right next to each assignment
(replying to @ colin "Setting up the auto combo UI…"): setting it up like this feels like it would be several times harder to use
not easier
...to be fair, complex mountains are difficult to set up, but, like, that's not because of the UI, that's because they are *complex mountains*

like all of the other types look *super* clear how they are intended to be set up

=== @ colin 10/12/2023 19:15

Moosh said it basically wouldn't be possible anyway

=== @ colin 10/12/2023 19:26

> I mean, there already are placeholders though?
yeah for sure, I was referring to more abstract placeholders similar to the "basic relational" setup. I was setting up the complex mountains the other day and I found many of the combos really difficult to read what joint they were supposed to represent.

Now, actually coming up with readable abstract placeholders is difficult, given the number of joints/facets to represent.

> setting it up like this feels like it would be several times harder to use
I'll agree to disagree here. I don't think I adequately communicated what I have in mind, but it would be hard to demonstrate that without an actual demo.

> ...to be fair, complex mountains are difficult to set up, but, like, that's not because of the UI, that's because they are complex mountains
True they're complex mountains, hence why I'm thinking on ways to make the setup easier. The easiest setup is for someone to give an "auto generate" template and just copy/paste. My intent was to more clearly communicate what the auto-generate template is supposed to be; when the tiles are fragmented as they are in the current UI, it's harder to tell how the pieces connect.

> like all of the other types look super clear how they are intended to be set up
I agree entirely here.

---

For what it's worth, I'm willing to think on and draw replacement placeholders if I can come up with something more readable, I hope this thread doesn't come off as "read my mind and make this feature easier to use"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 19:28

keep in mind that the colors used for the placeholders are also limited

=== @ colin 10/12/2023 19:29

sure, makes sense that it's related to the UI colors

=== @ colin 10/12/2023 19:30

while I'm here though, one feature about this whole setup that I think is a fairly uncontroversial improvement would be here:

1 - click on an empty assignment in the auto-combo UI
2 - note how in the combo selection UI, the placeholder isn't shown anywhere.

I frequently found myself when setting up auto-combos for the mountain, forgetting exactly which facet I was working on

So the improvement would just be to show the placeholder that you're assigning somewhere on the combo selection UI

that sounds pretty cursed to try
(the combo pages popup is janky jank mcjank jank jank old code)

=== @ colin 10/12/2023 19:31

ah, rip

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 19:32

combo pages, tile pages, tile grabber, tile editor are all super cursed
because like, you may have heard me reference "old gui" and "new gui" systems before
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "combo pages, tile pages, tile…"): these are NEITHER old OR new gui
they are hardcoded jank bullshit instead

=== @ colin 10/12/2023 19:32

lol, sheesh

=== @ colin 10/12/2023 19:34

well, sounds like this feature request can be closed then lol

as for placeholders, how many colors do I get? If I draw something I'll post it on this dev server at some point

looks like 3-4?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 19:41

(replying to @ colin "well, sounds like this featur…"): The hard limit would be based on the theme colors
you can look at the theme editor in the launcher, it has 8 colors per theme
but like, they are the same colors used by the rest of the ui
also @ Moosh isn't in this thread, should add him lol

=== @ Moosh 10/12/2023 22:57

For readability on engravings they really should use just a couple colors. If you open the editor in anything but Mooshmood or the old 2.50 ddfault it'll look unreadable because most of them don't use a single gradient. That's the real nightmare here

=== @ Moosh 10/12/2023 22:58

And I'd try using an A5 layer to get more colors, but they're on a scrolling pane so unless I'm mistaken that'd require a pretty large rework of the GUI system to do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 22:59

(replying to @ Moosh "And I'd try using an A5 layer…"): You'd need to figure out how to tie an a5 layer to a scrolling pane in some way
And clip the draw to the scrolled area

=== @ colin 10/13/2023 00:06

sounds good. I'll use minimal colors if I make any engravings

Feel free to close the issue, sounds like there's nothing to do here
or I guess I could close the post
