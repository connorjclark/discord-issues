Hard to define exactly how it's glitching, but if you have combos on screens that use the bg alpha color, it seems that those combos are being overlayed on multiple screens in the map viewer. I'm not using any layers so it shouldn't be anything related to those. Tried this on the latest nightly but I had the same issue with one from a few weeks back too so it seems to have been an issue for a while.

the screen with a square is to the left of the screen with the vine combos for reference.
tried indicating that by circling the screen indicator in the bottom left but then I realized it might be confusing and distracting from the actual issue lol
third screenshot is how it looks in the map viewer

Tldr glitch is in map preview/export view?
Those two green vines with weird outlines should look like the others?

the vines have a transparent bg but the screen to the left of them are showing up in the map viewer
I tried exporting the map but I couldn't find the file anywhere? so I'm not sure it's exporting correctly either.
