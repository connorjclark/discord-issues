..and the strange thing is that it's complaining that my quest is from "a more advanced" version of ZC, and that doesn't make sense since alpha-118 is more recent than the previous nightly build that loads my quest just fine

A118 is NOT more recent than the previous nightly build
that's your issue

connor had to re-release it
to fix a crash reporting thing

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/14/2023 03:34

I see...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/14/2023 03:34

so it has a new download
but that is still older code than the nightlies

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/14/2023 03:34

Thank you for clearing that up

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/14/2023 04:36

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/14/2023 04:38
