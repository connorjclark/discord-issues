Okay so you know how nowadays Keese Tribbles tribble into Vire Tribbles and Gel Tribbles tribble into Zol Tribbles. That should not happen in 1.90.
In 1.90, keese tribbles should tribble into regular (blue) vires and gel tribbles should tribble into regular zols. use this quest

if the keese tribble turns into a blue vire, that's good
as for the gel/zol tribbles, since they look identical to normal ones in 1.90 quests, we'll have to do a little detective work
type "zelda" and give yourself the white sword. if the zol that the gel tribble turns into is killable with the white sword, that's good because it is a regular zol as it should be. if it splits again, it's bad because it is a zol tribble as it should not be in 1.90
(this quest was saved in 1.90. use it as a reference for how 1.90 tribbles act when running 1.90 quests in modern zc)
