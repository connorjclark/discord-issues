It seems like the shutter door sfx that plays when you unlock blocks aren't playing. Instead you just get silence.

Is this a new lockblock that you just set up, or one from a tileset?
If you just set it up, you need to set the sound yourself in the attributes, now
lockblock combos in existing quests should have it autofilled to the door sfx
but, creating new ones you need to set it

Ah I see. I did set those up. So I just need to change the sfx. Got it.
Looks like this isn't a bug after all.
