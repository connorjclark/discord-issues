Self Explanatory. With this, you could make OOT style bomb bushes.

not so simple, because then you need all the options related to bombs

Well depending on how the liftables lweapon works, couldn't you just change the weapon type to bomb (for triggers) and script the death effect to be like a bomb?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 00:12

with a script, once I add script access to that weapon pointer, yes
now, not even with a script
since I haven't added that access yet
the big thing with a bomb is, ideally, you would want the option for it to tick down in your hand

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 00:16

which, the weapon in your hand does not do ANYTHING AT ALL but draw
so, as a request, yes this makes sense. As something doable, not easily. It'll take a bit.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "which, the weapon in your han‚Ä¶"): yeah the flow i'm thinking of is
1. Picking up bomb flower combo triggers combo script that starts a timer
2. Once timer ticks to zero Link's hands are emptied and an explosion is created if he is holding something, or the thrown object eweapon is erased and an explosion is created if he is not

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2022 07:19

so i think the key script additions here are being able to empty link's hands on demand and being able to check a quality of what link is holding to see if it has a characteristic that the questmaker knows designates it as a bomb (aka, rules out link's held item being anything BUT a bomb and the global script updates accordingly), such as sprite used or originating combo
(i remember this hack moosh did to see if the hammer was "down" for ghosted FFC detection for Helmasaur King's mask, because it counted as touching the FFC even when raised. so he just said "if the hammer's current tile is X, Y, Z, or A, it counts as down and should collide with the mask, otherwise it shouldn't". this "bomb in link's hands detection" would basically be like that)

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2022 07:21

i'm seeing all this combo stuff for lifted stuff in #1199 but nothing about reading/writing the qualities like sprite ID for the actual sprite link is holding or knowing what combo it came from, for instance
there's "release eweapon" for hero scripts but idk if that's what i'm talking about where link is just reset to not holding anything
because there's also a "force release of held object" in LTTP/LA, when you get hurt, where it auto-throws the object for you in addition to setting link's current held object to nothing, which is more than you'd want for just erasing the "is holding x" status for making the held bomb explode
