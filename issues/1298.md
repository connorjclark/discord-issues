Tried to research how fairies in OoT work, but the source code for that is blegh (even with a commented decomp, it's still a bit confusing)
But I'm pretty sure they move around in a circle moving up and down on the Z axis in a sine-like pattern
The question is whether or not  they ever chang direction or change the center of that circle

why would this be desirable? a fairy that you can't always get unless you have roc's feather

It certainly wouldn't be using real Z values
It'd just be Y offsets
The idea is to have a smoother animation for fairies
Might also look into LttP-styled fairies as well

I was planning on having a script for this if I could research it, but I figure that if I knew how they work, it'd be no more to just add to the engine instead of as a script
