Basically the item that falls down from the ceiling is overlayered over all overlayered tiles on map screens, preventing it from going behind the designs of the screens and looking funky.

So it should be on layer "7" until it lands on the ground, basically?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/26/2022 00:16

yeah
Reason is sometimes people could have overlayers on 6 is why

this is based on `Jump Layer Height` in Init Data, I think?
or maybe that doesn't apply to items....
not sure

but like, what really is the problem here?

The Key goes behind objects when dropping on screen.
through the air.
it falls behind the overlayers.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2022 06:46

that.... would be how layers work
layers are timed draws
so it *has* to be based on the actual screen position
I don't see a good way to fix this
without adding a ton of draw timing shit for items
which would be a looooot of work
