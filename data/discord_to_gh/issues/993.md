I've gotten complaints that the text for compiling zscript is too small and hard to read (the window that gives you the errors). Could we bump that up?

You can't just bump font size, so you need to actually change the font to one that is larger
but uh
the external parser is gonna entirely change how compile errors work
...namely, they will be printed to external file, because the parser won't be part of the zquest process.

. . . so now my question is
how does loading external text files for display work
like, how the `Help` button in strings displays `zstrings.txt`
and how the buffer editing works
.....and would there be a way to call that with variable font, to allow different sizes.
