This would mean that if you put an Armos->Item flag on a liftable combo, the screen's special item will appear on the combo once lifted. Like the seashells in Link's Awakening. One of the Secret Santa contestants would like it for their quest.

....or you could just make the combo drop that item when lifted using the lift tab stuff?

yeah, that doesn't work. It just spawns the item again even after picking it up, with the flag "Drops Special Item" checked.

"Drops Special item" flag checked
Item Drop set to the item ID I want (Secret Seashell's, in this case)

I go pick up the rock, the item spaws correctly, I pick it up, good.
Then I leave and re-enter the screen, lift it again, item spaws again

Sounds like something for a bug report, not a feature request
