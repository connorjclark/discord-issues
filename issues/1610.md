A combo QR for all warp combo types to work on Layers 1 and 2

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/13/2022 14:55

Do they not already?
huh
they work on *ffcs*

=== @ vlamart 05/13/2022 15:02

Huh, interesting. Is there a comprehensive list of what works on what layers and as ffcs? Should everything be able to work as such?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/13/2022 15:02

hahahhahaa
a 'comprehensive list'
who do we look like, real game devs?

=== @ vlamart 05/13/2022 15:03

Okay, I'll test it out and slow try to make one 😝
Probably won't even be started today though

=== @ vlamart 05/14/2022 01:51

Hopefully this is of some useful information. I also went hubris and put a few feature requests at the end (the most ambitious being the last two). @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:13

So, actually looking through this now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:15

oh god
despite being totally visible in discord
downloading the file, the columns of `x`s are completely misaligned
fun
ok, so
....I could have sworn conveyors were done for 1&2, but nope
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) weren't you doing that?
Armos/Grave/BS Grave I can see the reasoning for keeping those only on layer 0
because I.... do not want to imagine the enemy code changes involved in changing armos shit.
Block [weapon] combos should be simple enough to add @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)
Light Triggers on FFC won't work at all, because everything about the light system is grid based
....which makes me VERY confused @ vlamart that Glass works on ffc???
Slow Walk needs some improvements in general, similar to conveyors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:21

Warps definitely make sense, though if you tried to put multiple warps in the same spot on different layers it would be wacky
(probably sanest to just make it use the top-layered warp it finds and ignore any under that)
`Step` shit is in the same block as warps, I think? Not sure how easy that'll be...
Docks could probably be done, but it doesn't seem particularly urgently useful to do, so probably not a priority

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 23:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....which makes me VERY confu…"): Well technically, the solidity doesn't work, but light still passes through. I guess that technically means it doesn't work, but doesn't matter because that's what the glass does anyways, just solid? (which is yet to be implemented)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:23

...oh, duh
yeah, all glass does is make it NOT count as solid
but ffcs don't count anyway
so, that makes sense

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 23:24

Yes yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:24

light does just pass through any ffc
The entire light puzzle system
is ENTIRELY combogrid based
so making it work with things that aren't locked to the grid.... would be a not-so-fun endeavor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:25

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) any chance you want to make weapons handle mirrors on layers 1&2?

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 23:26

Please don't ffc mirros anyways, it would probably look weird 😝 Though diagonals might be "meeting in the middle", I'll have to play with light puzzles more

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 23:27

Is there a way to access all the light puzzle stuff via scripting if anyone wanted to do diagonals or animated light beams or other wacky stuff on their own?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:28

nope!
I hacked it all together in, like, an hour or something
and it hasn't been touched since

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 23:30

Well, I guess throw that in the gross feature request list at the bottom 😝

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:31

Also, nothing is actually stored long-term about it
other than the drawn bitmap

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 23:31

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "(probably sanest to just make…"): This can be specified in the combo type's "?"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:31

it just runs a calculation based on each spotlight, and draws everything to a bitmap, triggering the light triggers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:35

also gonna paste these separately
```
Feature Requests:
    Armos - Touch->Next (instead of undercombo) flag, proximity trigger flag and attribs (change if closer than x pixels; works in correlation with Touch->Next flag)
    Grave/BS Grave - attribs for specified enemy, quantity, and spawn rate if quantity > 0
    Block Weapons - similar to Block All/Arrow/etc., but uses the Trigger flags as what to block
    Bush/Flower/Tall Grass - match sprite CSet flag, as to not have green clippings or rustles on brown grass
    Shallow Water - match sprite CSet flag
    Slow Walk - custom speed flag/attribs
    Chests - specific item flag and attribs (to work around room type and screen flag), item rises from chest flag
    Generic Pushblock - flags for pushable directions (udlr, can combine), flag for Wait (enemies), flag and attribs for specific level push, flag and attribs for "pushing animation" combo (like if you make a push block that "rolls"), frictionless flag (after pushing, moves until hits solid, liquid, pit, no push blocks, block trigger, and block hole); once solid ffc's are ready, maybe also a flag for "no gridlock", then this can be the blueprint for an in-engine Cane of Somaria```
```
Armos:
'Next Combo' flag (next instead of undercombo) [easy]
'Proximity' flag/attrib (activate within range) [not easy]```
the Block Weapons via trigger flags is something I already had floated as an idea, never got around to it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:40

`item rises from chest` seems like a no

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 23:40

Generic Combos, when using it to spawn an enemy, does it spawn as soon as the combo appears? If so, just a new "Proximity->Next" combo type might be a good work around for the armos, just have the next combo be generic and spawn armos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 23:41

generic pushblock seems interesting, but would be quite a bit of work, as the entire pushing mechanic is very flag based rather than type based.
Not sure about generics, might be when triggered?
but you can set `automatically triggered` to make it trigger as soon as it appears, sooo

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/17/2022 00:35

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) weren't…"): yeah, I was intending to do that...

Ahh I see

thanks!
