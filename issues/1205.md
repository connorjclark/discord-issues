Speed Increase: how much the below flags use
-Firing Style: Original (every head has its own random rate), In Sync (there is one random rate and every head fires at once), One Head (there is one random rate and a random head is chosen to fire when it's time to fire. Like a Gleeok but with a random rate.)
Flags
-Use New Speed Calculation: starts at Step Speed, and every time a head is destroyed do the following increases

-Speed Increase is Multiplicative
Speed Increases may either be checkboxes or a dropdown.
