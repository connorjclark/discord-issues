Mismatched save data with regards to global variables and arrays seems to trip up new users quite often. Would it be possible to have a compiler setting (on by default) that totals up the size of the global stack before and after compile and displays a warning popup after if it has changed, informing the user that old saves will be incompatible and scripts may behave incorrectly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 02:06

huh, that sounds smart
it could also mention that you can bump the version info in `Header` to prevent users from loading saves that would be corrupted by this

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 02:21

Indeed. Provided Header version info actually works, because I've never actually used it and I don't know anyone who has 🤣

if the `Quest Ver` a quest was saved in is lower than `Min. Ver` of the `.qst` you are loading, it throws an error
pretty damn sure it works

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 02:24

Yeah I've seen these. I know what they do, just never messed with or gotten an error from loading a quest over them
There's a general trend in the ZC community of people being pretty bad at versioning

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 02:42

. . . hmm, so, I'm actually having trouble thinking of a good way to detect that changing
this is a bit more complicated than I thought at first

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 02:44

because, what I need to do, is know what the old value was. How do I do that, exactly? Measuring the size of the init script isn't reliable, as it appends the user init script, so that would detect any init script changes. Given, that could be a good thing. But, it also only detects a *size* change, not a *content* change.
...probably the best I can do, but now the question is how to go about it. This is gonna involve changing a bunch of different things just to process that count, and as such, sadly not gonna finish it tonight.
Also, I need to do it in a way that won't fuck up when we move to external parser, so I need to design it very specifically to avoid future issues

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 03:05

Ah yeah, makes sense. I only suggested it becuase I figured there might be the slimmest of chances it'd be possible without screwing with parser stuff

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 03:06

if it has to do with compiling, it means fucking with parser

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 04:06

OK, well, screw what I said about not finishing it tonight, because I'm insane as usual
well, technically it's past midnight, but meh

hmm, it's cut off at the end
so need to fix the gui, but it's popping up at the correct time
(the `(60->2)` refers to the ZASM linecount of the init script; for the record, `60` is with `std.zh` and `Classic.zh`; `2` is with just `std.zh`)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 04:38

(meta) thread name was changed: 💊🔓Warn on global variable change?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 05:20

...oh, and I immediately think of a way to make it better

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/900564083097600002/900614608673464350/unknown.png?ex=65e94eb7&is=65d6d9b7&hm=9160fc8760f988237e44d654788a4659c97edd4e4d9ee14756b677824a4f079f&)
Notice the `4->4`.... so the size is the same, yet there is a difference detected. Because I changed `int x = 0;` to `int x = 1;` as a global var. That was far easier than I thought it would be....
It eats up a slight chunk more memory for just a moment, as it stores a copy of the entire old init script (to compare to the new one), but that shouldn't be that big an issue
@ Moosh #deleted-channel

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 05:23

Nice!
Did not expect this one to be an overnight addition

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 05:55

The big thing I realized was, a previous change of mine made script data it's own struct (instead of just being a map of data); which made it fairly simple to just... copy the entire script data with a single `=`. Not hard to compare them, either; just a for loop.
Frankly the thing that took the longest was the dialog work
that's a new type of popup dialog, which takes an arbitrary amount of buttons; as both the text, and a function to call when it's clicked.
so, `2, 1, "Header", call_header_dlg, "OK", NULL` is the code for that one
(2 buttons, where `[1]` is the default focus; the OK button, here. The first button says "Header", calling '`void call_header_dlg()`, while the second says "OK", and closes the dialog)
with this, I should be able to make a lot of small customized dialogs, without needing to actually create new dialog code every time
(anything that has a title, textbox, and then buttons)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:43

Is this an option?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:44

No, but you can mash enter to get past it as the `OK` button is selected by default

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:44

Hmm
Might get annoying when youre devving a quedt

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:44

if we get complaints it's easy enough to add a config
but, that will be easier once I've redone the `Etc->Options` dialog

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:45

Can I request a config now?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:45

sure.... I'll get to it once I've redone the `Etc->Options` dialog

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:45

This is really cool btw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:46

You should see the actual dialog code for it
because, it takes *arbitrary buttons*
You could call it with 5 buttons that run 5 different functions

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:46

...actually, what is the max version a quest can have?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:46

...well, 4, because one button needs to run `NULL`, as that's what closes the dialog
uh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:47

it's a 9 character *string*
and they are compared via `strcmp()`
so, for instance, you could do `00.00.01`, and then it would recognize `02.00.00` as "greater"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:48

Oof

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:49

```cpp
if(QHeader.minver[0])
{
    if(strcmp(g->version,QHeader.minver) < 0)
        ret = qe_minver;
}
```

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:50

Im not familiar with strcmp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:50

....not sure what it would make of `0.0.0` vs `10.10.10`, though
or `0.9.0` vs `0.0.10`
time for online compiler for fast testing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:53

`0.9.0` > `0.0.10`
`10.10.10 > 0.0.0`
so, that seems to work as one would hope

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:55

`10.0.0 > 0.99.99`

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 06:55

For real?
Here I would've assumed it just discards decimal places past the first

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:55

```
Compares the C string str1 to the C string str2.

This function starts comparing the first character of each string. If they are equal to each other, it continues with the following pairs until the characters differ or until a terminating null-character is reached.

This function performs a binary comparison of the characters. For a function that takes into account locale-specific rules, see strcoll.```
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) that's `strcmp`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:56

Okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:56

(replying to @ Moosh "For real?"): yep, versioning is important to have multiple places
basically how this comparison works is, if it hits a decimal in one before the other, it knows it has less digits in that 'place', thus it knows which is better
if they are the same through a decimal, it would hit that check for the next 'place'

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 06:57

For actual developers, yeah. This is a little used feature in a program from the early 2000's though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:57

and if they are same length, but different values, it would compare the actual numbers

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 06:58

Would it think 1.0.1 is less than 1.0.000?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 06:58

See i was gonna suggest a config option to bump up the subversion when it detects this stuff, but that sounds nightmarish now

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 06:59

That sounds like it'd just annoy people and go unused tbh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:59

`1.0.1` > `1.0.000`
basically, `1.0.` == `1.0.`
then `1 > 0`
it goes char by char
now,

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/21/2021 07:00

I mean, the way it works nowvis that it shows a popup each time it happens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:00

`1.0.1 < 1.00.1`
....so try to make your `0`'s consistent

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 07:00

yeah that's what I was thinking of. I stuck the extra 0's in the wrong place
not that any sane person would do that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:01

I could probably write a new function to compare them and catch things like that
basically, if the strings contain nothing but numbers and `.`'s, read each number as a number, and compare values, one by one

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 07:04

Wait a sec is this all just strcmp? If I have my quest at version `Necromancer` and upgrade it into `WhyWouldYouDoThis`, would that count as an increase in version?
no it wouldn't because neither of those fit in the text field

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:06

It fits 9 chars

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 07:06

But if I wanted to be absolutely mad I could version my quest with arbitrary strings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:07

`banana > apple`
because `b > a` at the first comparison
keeping in mind that `a > Z`, as all capitals are in a row before the lowercases start
and it is case-sensitive compare

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:19

K, made a new function
`1.0.1 == 1.00.1`
If any character in the string is not either a number or a decimal, it just returns `strcmp()` still, so alphabetic shit would still work as expected
but, if it's all numbers + decimals, it tries to compare it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:26

incase anyone cares to inspect, here it is:
```cpp
int8_t smart_vercmp(char const* a, char const* b)
{
    for(int q = 0; a[q]; ++q)
    {
        if((a[q] >= '0' && a[q] <= '9') || a[q] == '.')
            continue;
        return strcmp(a, b);
    }
    for(int q = 0; b[q]; ++q)
    {
        if((b[q] >= '0' && b[q] <= '9') || b[q] == '.')
            continue;
        return strcmp(a, b);
    }
    char *cpya = (char*)zc_malloc(strlen(a)), *cpyb = (char*)zc_malloc(strlen(b));
    strcpy(cpya, a); strcpy(cpyb, b);
    char *ptra = cpya, *ptrb = cpyb, *tmpa = cpya, *tmpb = cpyb;
    std::vector<int32_t> avec, bvec;
    while(*(ptra++))
    {
        if(*ptra == '.')
        {
            *ptra = 0;
            avec.push_back(atoi(tmpa));
            tmpa = ++ptra;
            if(!*ptra) break;
        }
        if(!*ptra)
        {
            avec.push_back(atoi(tmpa));
            break;
        }
    }
    while(*(ptrb++))
    {
        if(*ptrb == '.')
        {
            *ptrb = 0;
            bvec.push_back(atoi(tmpb));
            tmpb = ++ptrb;
            if(!*ptrb) break;
        }
        if(!*ptrb)
        {
            avec.push_back(atoi(tmpb));
            break;
        }
    }
    zc_free(cpya); zc_free(cpyb);
    while(avec.size() < bvec.size())
        avec.push_back(0);
    while(bvec.size() < avec.size())
        bvec.push_back(0);
    for(int q = 0; q < avec.size(); ++q)
    {
        if(avec.at(q) < bvec.at(q))
            return -1;
        if(avec.at(q) > bvec.at(q))
            return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:28

`zc_malloc`/`zc_free` are zc-wrapper-versions of `malloc` and `free`, which basically make an array with a size not known at compile time (here, with whatever size the input strings are)
(and yes that is a good chunk of pointer shenanigans, because it makes it easier)

=== @ Moosh 10/21/2021 07:32

~~ZScript malloc when~~ (this is joke pls do not take seriously)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 07:35

I mean, legitimately wouldn't be hard with how arrays work internally
just gotta spend the time to put together the logic for it
(It wouldn't work quite like C++, but it would be a function like `ResizeArray(arr, size, 0)` (the `0` being `fill any new space with 0s`)
I feel like last time I looked at it that was the plan I had, anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 10:00

@ Moosh So that last build actually has a couple *crashes* that my test quest didn't catch. Might wanna grab the new one.
Also, the new one includes `ResizeArray()`. It doesn't take a thing to fill the space with, it's just:```cpp
void ResizeArray(untyped[] arr, int size);
 * Resizes the array 'arr' to size 'size'.
 * If size is <1, the array will be resized to size '1'.```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 10:09

Here's the test case
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/900564083097600002/900687124758683648/unknown.png?ex=65e99240&is=65d71d40&hm=92839eae88d17f7a4ccd7c6cfc87c967e368ff284b5e25009d163c74b4bcc3b5&)
It uses the same function that array declaration uses, because that's already just a resizing operation. So, it should have every new index be `0`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 10:20

.....except wait fuck that's not working dammit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 10:21

oh duh, I see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 10:24

ahk, fixed it
#deleted-channel
So, if you size up an array, it fills the new area with `0`
if you size down an array, it obviously just chops the end off and leaves the same area in tact.
Technically then, if you size it down and back up, you can clear a chunk off the end of it
....probably not the best way to do so, though; memset() is much better.
Also, the cool thing is, from what I understand, global arrays resizing *should save in the save file*, as you would hope it would.
It saves a `count` followed by that number of indexes; but the count is determined by the same thing that `SizeOfArray()` reads, which clearly is changed.
Anyway, night.
