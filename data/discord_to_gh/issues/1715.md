oh that commit is pretty small
when I reverted it, it fixed.

oh, well, that *would* fix it
but also cause other issue
now if you load a long path
close zcl
and reopen
the textbox will be way too BIG

ok, just rulling out al5. probably not gonna look more into this one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:54

What you could probably do though
is just
add `maxwidth = someamount_px`
