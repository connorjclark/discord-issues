A Quest Rule that changes the sound that plays when an enemy is stunned from the enemy's npcdata Hurt sound to a general sound that is selected in the SFX Data menu.

What would be the point of that out of curiosity. Just so you don't have to manually set the SFX for each enemy, or?

no, like
to have a stun sound separate from a hit sound

Ohhhh

yeah like if you set an enemy to roar when hit it might seem a little silly for that to apply to the boomerang stunning it as well
