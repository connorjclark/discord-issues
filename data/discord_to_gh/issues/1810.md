Playing Randomizer Omega and I noticed remote bombs cost 1/16 of a heart instead of bomb ammo. Verified with HeroOfFire that it's supposed to cost bomb ammo. They tested further and it seems like a lot of non-default items broke like this. The problem remains in the latest nightly, but seems to at least go back to an alpha 107 build from May and possibly earlier.
