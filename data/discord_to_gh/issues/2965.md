No repro here, but there are hundreds of crash reports for this. Here is one:

https://zeldaclassic.sentry.io/issues/4829947136/?project=6563738&query=is%3Aunresolved&referrer=issue-stream&stream_index=4


checkCast can return null, but this usage of it does not handle null.

@ DeletedUser you (or someone else using z3) managed to generate a crash like this - did you ever notice? know what code did it?
I wonder if it happens only during code authoring.

the vs code plugin is naturally sending the compiler lots of inputs of slightly wrong code as you type, which probably stresses it like a 10000 monkies with typewriters

That...looks familiar, I think, but I have no idea from where
Does it say what time they were reported?

=== @ ChefBear 01/08/2024 04:03

And when you say crash, you mean the thing that happens when vs code tells me that the server is shutting down cuz I'm spamming too many errors

reproduced
```cpp
int arr[] = {1,2,3};
Trace(arr[sgadsfgasdf]);```
the index being invalid isn't breaking out of the recursion soon enough
so it prints the undeclared identifier error for sgadsfgasdf and then crashes
...just needs an extra `if (breakRecursion(host)) return;` above the `checkCast`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/08/2024 05:50

(in the case where it would be `null`, an error would already have been thrown which sets the recursion-breaking flag)

nice

if any other spots similar to this pop up, the solution is likely identical
