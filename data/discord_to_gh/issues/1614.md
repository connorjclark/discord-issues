Basically, if you set up switch blocks in just the right way, you can soft lock yourself by walking off them

Here's an exampl quest to show it
Walk directly upright from the start and you'll see what I mean
Essentially, the bug happens when you have switch blocks you can walk on top of set up in an upside down L formation
If you start on the bottom block, four pixels up from the grid, and walk up right, when you fall off, you'll be stuck
In the example linked, the block Link starts on is at position 64, 96
Link begins at position 64, 92
Walking up and right, he'll fall off and become trapped at 72, 84 and forced to F6
I'm sure that anything that gets him at position 72, 84 would do it. This was just the easiest way I could find to replicate it
The magic value here appears to be four pixels above the central positioning of the L

Thiiis.... is annoying as hell
since you don't have large hitbox on, it's checking y+12
as link's `center of collision`
which... happens to be 96, inside the next combo down, which isn't a switchblock
so it has you 'fall'
...but standard solidity code won't let you slip out of that corner.
Fucking FUN

This seems to fix it, not sure how it changes the general behavior though
(I'm just using y+8 regardless of bighitbox)
