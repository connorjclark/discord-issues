Lit Bomb explosions trigger Bomb flags, Lit Super Bomb explosions trigger Super Bomb flags. Both trigger bombable dungeon walls obviously
(meta) thread name was changed: QR - Enemy Projectiles Trigger Combos And Bombable Walls
Oh another idea
Enemy fire triggering burn combos or lighting torches
The same would presumably apply to boomerangs, sword beams, and wind, but those are less of a priority
