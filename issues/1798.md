Palette Importing from images is broken. The first image is what the palette in the edited screenshot looks like in ASEsprite. The second image is what ZC reads from the image and I know I haven't updated ASEsprite and it worked fine in previous versions of ZC, so the problem has to be on ZC's side.

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) The problem here being that ZC isn't reading the palette correctly when in did in previous versions. I use ASEsprite as a shortcut to editing and making new palettes for ZC and I don't know what has happened on the palette importer side of things but it's simply not reading the palette correctly now.

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/04/2022 09:16

also, I had to use an editor screenshot because non-editor screenshots don't preserve the internal colour index structure when used. In previous 2.50 derived versions of ZC (probably prior to the allergo 5 migration) this wasn't a problem

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/04/2022 09:17

stick to bmp for now

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/04/2022 09:18

I swapped to bmp and I'm still getting the same problems

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/04/2022 09:20

Nope, still getting the same exact issue with bmp

=== @ P-Tux7 08/07/2022 07:04

others have confirmed this

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/15/2022 22:58

Still broken in the latest build

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/16/2022 03:26

https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5/issues/1369
in the meantime, it will "work" if you have all the colors in the image and in the expected order, lol

=== @ P-Tux7 08/16/2022 16:48

doesn't that mean you need to have a row of colours at the top
aka an entire tile's worth of them because zq can only import in 16x16 increments

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/16/2022 17:28

First off, I'm joking. Just describing the bug in another way

But yes
Well idk about the tiles worth thing
I'd think just an entire row of one color at a time would do it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:14

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Well idk about the tiles wort…"): I mean, you would, as a 1 pixel worth would offset the image by 1 pixel, and the import cannot offset except in increments of 16

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/03/2022 16:04

Allegro folk have almost implemented accessing the palette, should be ready soon

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 04:15

this should being working again in latest nightly, for BMP

=== @ P-Tux7 09/06/2022 05:05

Great!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 07:53

@ FireSeraphim try this https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2022-09-06

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 07:59

Pallete importation is still broken

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 08:01

whats the filetype

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 08:03

I'll try it again via bmp real quick

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 08:03

only bmp will work for sure.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 08:16

Looks like palette importation works now
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1004677243831865344/1016622811856506890/Screen_Shot_013.PNG?ex=65e6d4c6&is=65d45fc6&hm=5f9cbe46bf72c099bbca35894db07bf8c6995b454a92abd4f120b829d7d85dc1&)
although what's on the first palette is kinda curious, but if it what's require for it to work, then I'm not complaining

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2022 08:17

the question is, what did the palette look like that that image was created with?
Was it exported from another quest, in which case what was that quest's palette?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 08:18

I took a snapshot of the work I'm working on Zquest then editted the colours via asesprite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2022 08:18

does the palette match the palette in asesprite?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 08:18

here's what it actually looks like in asesprite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2022 08:19

huh, that's weird

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 08:19

Not exactly, but since the core set of dungeon colours otherwise render correctly, then I say that it's kinda done.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 08:25

Is that not what it did even before allegro 5

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2022 08:26

that is a good question
I've never used the feature

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 08:26

the first row becomes the result of allegro 4 doing a "best fit" thing that I don't fully understand
if I'm reading the code correctly it's always done that (and it was something I was missing until just now)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2022 08:27

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "Looks like palette importatio…"): > Is that not what it did even before allegro 5
can you test that @ FireSeraphim

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 08:27

Comparing against alpha 85 would be interesting
or just any before allegro 5

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 08:28

I have a copy of 2.53 in reserve

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 08:28

if that's known to work, sure same thing
Also, I fixed jpgs pngs and gifs from importing absolute garbage btw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2022 08:29

nice

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 08:30

This is how it looks in 2.53

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2022 08:30

aye, ok, my intuition was correct

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 08:30

And that's your palette exactly huh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2022 08:30

the palette should match asesprite

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 08:30

yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 08:31

Gimme that image
Cuz the image details matter
Gotta know the bpp
and figure out when I'm supposed to NOT call this "best fit" thing

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 08:31

This is my screenshot with the palette I edited

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 08:31

Thanks, will look more tomorrow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2022 08:32

where is this code, by the way?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2022 08:32

Aye, glad to be of service

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2022 08:32

allegro-addons/al5img/src/al5img.c

=== @ NightmareJames 09/06/2022 13:24

Reporting screenshot functions fixed
Trying importing now

=== @ NightmareJames 09/06/2022 13:26

I think BMP's work fine for importing, though I'll allow the more adept artists to confirm this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/07/2022 05:02

https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2022-09-07 should get things back to normal for bmp.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/07/2022 11:02

I can now confirm that pallete importation has been fully fixed
