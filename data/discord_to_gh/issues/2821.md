You can see this easily by loading new quest, selecting any tile on first page, B to convery to 8 bit. the transparent pixels (value 0) of previous 4-bit tiles are now BLACK, instead of 0. I'd expect it should be transparent.

Note, this is in A119 so is unrelated to recent changes.

B and Shift+B do different things
just B will leave the transparent (color 0) pixels as color 0 *of the current cset*, which is not treated as transparent anymore for 8bit tiles
Shift+B treats any transparent pixel as transparent still

This has (afaik) always been the behavior of 8-bitting and I do think it would be nice if it went this way MOST of the time but there are cases where you wouldn't want it

Personally, it would be nice if it popped up a dialog with multiple buttons for options instead of being based on shift
I might handle that in a bit

ah, I should have tried random modifiers lol
