Script access `bool Game->ItemStringRead[]`, read/write access to the bits that mark pickup strings as having already been displayed.

This would allow scripts to, say, read the real time clock, and if you haven't played for a while, reset the strings to display again. Or any number of other uses, but that's one that comes to mind immediately.

I'll look into it; I'm not comfortable with adding new ZScript cause I fear it'll break or etc

If you want to vc with me I can walk through it with you again (at some point less 3:30am)

like, adding ZScript stuff is thousands of times easier than most of the things you've done
(i.e. all it takes is knowing the basic steps, and it's not bad)

the intention was `at a reasonable hour`, dammit

Best to define working hrs and time zone. ;)
Idk what this new command is. Itemsprite and it3lemdata PString are both r/w afaik

So, item pickup strings only play once
How does that work? An internal bit is set if they have already been played, of course
....scripts can't read those bits.
