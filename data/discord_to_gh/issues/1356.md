Box Keeps popping up, even while i am using latest version for my quest and even saving it in the newest version, this box still keeps popping up, even when i try to play the quest.

This seems to be happening in the Feb 17th nightly build. In fact, it appears when loading 1st.qst.

Notice how it refers to 2.53 legacy release (the prior box was from a quest I last saved in 2.52)

In any case, these boxes should not be true, as my quest file was directly copied from my 2.52 folder, and thus never even opened in a recent zQuest version.

For fucks sake
Firstly, the version info being wrong is zoria's doing
(it would have been printing that wrong version info to allegro.log every time you loaded the quest prior...)
but why the FUCK is that box still popping up???

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 19:44

....
are you sure that's last saved in 2.50.2?

2.50.2 is `Build 29`
for that to show `2.53.0 Release ??`, it was last saved in `Build 32`
(Keep in mind that 2.50.2 can open/play 2.53 quests just fine)
(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "This seems to be happening in‚Ä¶"): also, why the fuck is that off-center?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 19:49

...OH I'm a dumbass
(not the off-center, the still popping up)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/18/2022 19:53

The 2.53.0 release message box shows up once I input a new file name, it appears to be showing up cause it views the default *1st.qst* as saved in a newer build.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 19:53

aye, yeah
so uhh
It first compares the major version
then the alpha state
then the alpha version

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/18/2022 19:54

But yeah, the 2.52 build is indeed 29.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 19:54

but, you see
the stupid that I did
It was going `oh, 2.53 < 2.55`
but then it was going `Release > Alpha, show warning`
instead of stopping at `2.53 < 2.55`
it should only keep going if the first check gives `==`
