Title says all for newest record/replay function in ZC.

Sorry, too much work for me to do anytime soon.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 05:24

And I don't really see the point, why do you want that?
And do you just mean during replay (playback)?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 05:25

I would assume during playback
to show what inputs it is that were recorded
Makes sense for a feature like this, frankly; though it's absolutely the visual icing on the cake

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 05:29

Maybe something not fancy would be quick to do. Just flashing text for buttons currently held down, with same code that does the fps counter

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 05:31

except it's really unclear to me where to draw things so. this wouldn't be quick
(`show_fps` and friends don't read clearly to me)

Here is concept of graphical input display, inspired by similar feature in SMBX2. Held buttons are rendered green in playback.

Once this is merged I can handle fancifying it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 05:54

thanks emily
this is all i care to muster üòõ
I tried putting it in the bottom/top part of the windows (better contrast)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 05:55

Believe me I understand the sentiment

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 05:55

but they dont get cleared every frame, and i'm scared to do that, so
meh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 05:57

Any area of the screen that isn't currently cleared, can be
nothing should ever be drawing in that area
so, it doesn't *need* to be cleared
but if you want to draw there, clearing it shouldn't hurt anything

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 05:57

was thinking they'd be better spots for things like this or the FPS

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 05:58

that would be very smart

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 05:58

since white text isnt always visible on game view

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 00:49

was this done?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 01:04

I don't plan on doing this, maybe move text to below game field but that'd be all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 01:04

ahk, I'll close then
