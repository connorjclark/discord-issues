Noticed this when trying to load a quest. It looks like either the UI window or the drawn cursor in ZC are misaligned.

If I click on quests, it selects music. If I click on music, it selects modules. If I want to go back a directory, I need to double click the second displayed option (sentry native in this screenshot).
This also seems to apply to the UI buttons. If the cursor is shown over the top half of a button, clicking may do nothing cause it thinks I'm not actually over the button but somewhere above it.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 18:37

This seems to be only occurring with this kind of UI window, the "ESC" Menu works properly, if I hover over Load Quest it's actually regestering as selecting Load Quest.

hmm

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 18:45

This was fine in 112, so it's a Nightly thing only.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 18:45

I have a suspicion

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 18:51

This is only in zc, yes?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 18:51

As far as I can tell.
Did not see anything off so far in zQuest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 18:52

ahk, well I suspect it's like a 1 line fix
but I'm busy with complex rewrite work that I need to get to compile properly first so I can push it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 19:44

..errr
except now that I get a moment to test this @ HeroOfFireZC
It doesn't appear to happen for me?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 19:46

Weird, cause it feels like it's the height of a line off for me. If I want to select a quest, I need to click on the one below it.
When in doubt...

Wonder if anything in my scaling is doing it.
Except... it should be identical to what I was using in 112

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 19:48

out of curiosity, set `ignore_monitor_scale = 1`

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 19:50

Yeah, it's something to do with that. But 112 had it off and it worked fine.
(when it's off, I get a *tiny* ZC window)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 19:50

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>
That being off should be just disabling your windows "Scale and Layout" crap
If you just change ZC's resolution to be larger, does it work?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 19:54

(I'll attempt my fix, and hopefully it'll be fixed? but if this one fix doesn't work I have no idea)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 19:56

I can play around with this, still strange it was working fine before.
(I basically figured out that "Video Mode" was 1.5, so looked at 2, took those values and put them in the config, since the Launcher isn't visually updating in 2-25)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 19:57

(oof, launcher sad)

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079108791066448012/1079130117156114523/zlauncher.exe?ex=65ecbf3d&is=65da4a3d&hm=91951aea1e05c16cc7b50ceb132b467345c23556536a771020072091aca5f260&
have a working launcher

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 19:59

Okay, if there isn't a fix, I can just toggle that option and change the resolution to the "Video Mode x2" values and it seems to be the same effect?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 19:59

it should be
(and that option being ignored *is default*, for the record)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 20:00

Ah, probably something from carrying over config files from an earlier version where it was preferrable.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 20:10

So.... funny thing. I guess I had *not* toggled "Ignore Monitor Scale" on a few things. Did something change recently (obviously fine when toggled)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:12

...well that's not happy with something
assuming that's the one I sent you.... thaaat might need a new build package whole

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 20:12

Nightly 2-11

So, only recently did "Ignore Monitor Scale" being off do weird things?
Perhaps the weird "display not updating" for the Launcher was actually part of this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:13

oooh wait, I see what's wrong here
(there are like 5 different things here, don't bother trying to figure it out)
(I'm rewriting like fucking everything)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 20:14

Fair enough, things in transition.
(also while in that glitchy display, guess what, it's hard to tell where to click to do anything. Sounds familiar)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 20:16

Seems likely the bug is really "Buggy UI when Ignore Monitor Scale is off"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:21

oh, no, uh, most of the buggy doesn't care about that checkbox
most of it is just broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:23

The fun thing is I didn't want to rewrite how the damn launcher handles this dialog stuff
but, I had *no choice*, because I had to change it in areas shared by all 3 programs
and I feel like the problem is just that I missed one thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:24

....also holy cow

you get a lot of fps sitting on a game over screen
@ HeroOfFireZC here have a sane one

test in new nightly (~30min)
