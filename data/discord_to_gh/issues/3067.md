Shadows for enemies and entities that move through Z-axis inconsistently draw shadows. The quest rule "Hardcoded Shadows/Spawn/Death Anim Frames" is not properly implemented for various enemy types `::drawshadow`

Boulders and rocks do not have shadows, and Link's shadow when jumping is just a single frame, the first in the set animation frames for shadows.

Also if objects lifted/thrown with the lift glove such as bushes and rocks are *supposed* to have shadows, they do not. The "fake z throw" tag is disabed for the lift glove but they do not have shadows.

(replying to @ Whiterose "Also if objects lifted/thrown…"): Is "weapons have shadows" on?

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 15:20

No its not

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 15:21

give me a second I'll test if that does something

=== @ Whiterose 02/19/2024 15:22

yes that fixes thrown object shadows but the others are still not there
