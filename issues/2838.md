> we need to do something about the incomplete enemies in the enemy list
> 2.55 made a lot of unimplemented enemies visible to the end-user

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2023 20:54

oh right
can't we just... undo that
whistle pols voice DOES need to be flagged as visible now though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2023 21:51

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "whistle pols voice DOES need…"): I mean, that's the problem
for the enemy *IDs*, any that are bleh should be nuked on quest load
....except, what if quests *spawned these using scripts* before?
bleh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/14/2023 00:03

ptux, please consider these issues to be public (at least some day), so refrain from mean words
please edit the comment or I'll just delete 🫠
just ... could look bad

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2023 00:04

We've definitely openly talked about poor choices of the old devs plenty before

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/14/2023 00:04

yeah and it's just a bad look
I'm guilty too
but try to hold back a lot
I think it's more fine outside issue threads

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2023 00:04

(like seriously, sideview was unfinished AF on release...)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/14/2023 00:05

I'm not saying never mentioning things being done in a not good way, but just refraining from name calling as a result
not even saying you shouldn't express exasperation when you come across such things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2023 00:06

aye, particular word choice could be better

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/14/2023 00:06

we don't have a code of conduct per se but let's assume this to be part of it moving forward ?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/14/2023 00:12

yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/03/2023 05:33

Which things needs to be hidden?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/03/2023 05:54

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "for the enemy *IDs*, any that…"): whichever enemy ids were hidden in 2.50.2

=== @ P-Tux7 12/03/2023 19:19

whistle pols voice don't need to be hidden

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/08/2024 02:57

can someone please name a few enemies that are unimplemented?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/08/2024 02:58

is the set of enemies in a new quest file that have black gfx?

Shooter?
what are these NPC ones...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/08/2024 03:04

not necessarily
trigger/shooter in particular are not
(trigger is an invisible enemy used for some things)
(shooter is spawned by the `Statue` combo types to make them shoot fireballs)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/08/2024 03:09

ah, found the marker for it
`guys.cpp`, `old_guy_string`
any of these strings that end with a space character are the enemies in question

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1172954117455487006/1193753364463358012/image.png?ex=65e53b74&is=65d2c674&hm=85e732d4fcca49ab419d6b866c6b64e2989eb08f9b06fbbb6017cb318a766e1c&)
there IS code here for filtering these out still
I'm assuming `defaultFilter` is just false?
well, that's for new gui listers; but there would be old listers that need the same thing somewhere else probably

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/08/2024 03:10

god this enemy data embedded in the code is just the worst
thats a good find tho

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/08/2024 03:10

yeah lol its so bad
....given, the thing is
we actually don't really want to hide these slots anymore? I don't think?
at least in the new default quest
....but they uh, should probably be *cleared* in the default quest
to just be new blank spots
(at least for the ones ending in spaces; the 'segment components' and 'guys' can probably be hidden entirely forever tbh....)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/08/2024 03:17

the main reason the guys were even visible pretty sure was to let you edit their appearance
but like, you can just do that in the room data now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/01/2024 06:16

`build_bie_list` is the old gui lister for enemies.
It has a `hide` param that works kinda the same.
From what I can tell, it's already removing enemies that end in a space like the new gui lister does.
I'm not really clear on what needs to be done here, so someone else will need to handle this.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/01/2024 07:28

oh, i didn't change anything about the whistle pols voice in that regard
so it will have to be whitelisted

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/10/2024 03:33

So I think these unimplemented enemies should be unreserved. If we add new enemies we can do so via editing classic.qst
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1172954117455487006/1205718235446517791/image.png?ex=65ebd89c&is=65d9639c&hm=d6d689da2b08bc1b34a13d642c6e12510459492ebbd5aeba2a984ed45094f0af&)
the NPC Standing/Walking should all be yeet.
the Guys should all be visible but renamed to Guy (name) so they're out of the way
Grappler Bug needs to be unreserved/renamed to a zz enemy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/10/2024 03:38

The following Trap enemies need to go:
Trap (/, Constant)
Trap (/, Line of Sight)
Trap (8 Way)
Trap (CCW, Constant)
Trap (CCW, Line of Sight)
Trap (CW, Constant)
Trap (CW, Line of Sight)
Trap (Diagonal)
Trap (\\, Constant)
Trap (\\, Line of Sight)
Wizzrobe (Ice) needs to go
I have no clue what Spinning Tile (Enemy Sprite) is; that's a 2.50 enemy but I'm not entirely sure what it does (Spinning Tile (Combo) is used for spinning tile combos I think)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2024 20:33

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "So I think these unimplemente…"): you mean default.qst (file->new)? or the tilesets/classic.qst?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2024 20:34

I forgot tilesets/classic.qst was even there. It hasn't gotten any updates at all... maybe we should remove that?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2024 20:39

I mean default.qst yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 05:31

of course `old_guy_string` would be in defined in two places

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 05:56

so it seems I should just add spaces to the end of all those enemies to hide em

(and remove the space from the end of whistle pol)
new file looks right.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/17/2024 07:33

thanks!
