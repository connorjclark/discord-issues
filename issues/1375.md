@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) @ Saffith
A place to collect some information on shit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2022 06:27

Firstly, icon file generation, which was needed for ZCL:
From repo dir, run:
`/bin/sh ./allegro/tools/x11/xfixicon.sh ./zl_icon.xpm -o ./zl_icon.c`
Installation prereq:`sudo apt install imagemagick-6.q16`
Also may require `touch /tmp/allegico_xpm.xpm`
(meta, MessageType.pins_add)

Build instructions: (all commands start from repo directory)
1. Set compiler (ex g++):```sh
export CXX=g++```2. Make Allegro```sh
cd allegro
cmake .
make
```3. Fix `allegro/include/allegro/platform/alplatf.h`; change ```cpp
#define ALLEGRO_UNIX``` to ```cpp
#ifndef ALLEGRO_UNIX
#define ALLEGRO_UNIX
#endif```
4. Make ZC:```sh
cd build
cmake ..
make```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2022 06:44

```sh
sudo apt install g++-multilib
sudo apt install libx11-dev:i386

branch `2.55-linuxtemp` I'm trying to get working here

Figured it out

Builds, but no sound, and everything executable-related (the new consoles, the new launcher, and the test play mode) is nonfunctional; given, the former is an old known issue at this point (still needs to be fixed....), and the latter is expected (considering basically all of the related code is IFDEFd by platform, with NO code in the linux sections, because no one has written that yet)

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Builds, but no sound, and eve…"): ^Note the limitations; no SFX, no consoles, and no external processes will work
...which, thanks to recent changes, also means you won't be able to compile zscript in this build
but, editing and playing quests works, sans the sound

proper dual-boot setup

=== @ Mitsukara 02/11/2022 22:17

Oh, cool! Thanks!

=== @ Mitsukara 02/11/2022 22:19

Although, uh, problem. I'm not sure how to actually run `zelda` or `zquest` (which lack any file extensions for some reason? The 2.50.2 linux build still used .exe ). Tried opening them in Mono Runtime, but nothing happens.
I'm guessing these ran for you in Linux Mint _somehow_, but I'm not sure what you did to run them XD

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 01:18

`.exe` wasn't working for me
but you can run them from terminal as executables
I just opened terminal in that folder and did `./zelda` or `./zquest`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 01:21

also, for the record, the only thing that would be done to make them exe would be to rename them and add `.exe`
so if you wanted to try that @ Mitsukara

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 16:25

Just pushed an attempt at some fixes... need to pull it on the linux boot and test it later.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/14/2022 07:41

(replying to @ Mitsukara "Although, uh, problem. I'm no…"): so, if I set the file to be `.exe`, double clicking it opens it in Archive Manager. I see no way whatsoever to make it run on double click, you appear to *need* the terminal.
There is one exception; `RClick->Run As Administrator`
which, seems to... open a terminal as administrator, and run the command for you.

=== @ Mitsukara 02/17/2022 22:19

Sorry I haven't checked back into this. Haven't had much focus the past few days, some stuff going on, going to be doing a bit of a cross-country expedition in April because of it. (short version: additional roommate, emptying a storage locker across the country we've wound up paying for for years because life was a mess pre-early 2018)

=== @ Mitsukara 02/17/2022 22:22

I don't actually a run as administrator option, weirdly? Whether I rename it to .exe or not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 22:23

guess that's a linux mint thing?

=== @ Mitsukara 02/17/2022 22:23

I am on Linux Mint XFCE (with the chicago95 skin, but that shouldn't affect this)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 22:23

oh
hmm
<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>

=== @ Mitsukara 02/17/2022 22:24

possibly I need to update my system? I do have a pretty long uptime at the moment
I'll try to open it directly with the terminal

=== @ Mitsukara 02/17/2022 22:27

why does it want to open libzcsound.so while opening Zelda? I thought the sound was disabled and not included
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Mitsukara"): bear in mind, I'm still using these files you posted the other day, so if that's not what you're using anymore, I don't have your new one yet

=== @ Mitsukara 02/17/2022 22:31

(I also tried it with `sudo` just in case, but it's the same error. It seems like `zelda` insists on opening a library called `libzcsound.so`, which is apparently shared with something. I do have the file in the directory, though?)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 00:35

Huh

=== @ Mitsukara 02/19/2022 06:59

Belated thing, but if anyone is looking for 2.50.2 Linux, https://www.dropbox.com/s/e2dih2kdbdt0138/zc-2-50-2-linux.tar.gz?dl=0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2022 07:01

Should be on the downloads page too
Since you sent me that

=== @ Saffith 03/07/2022 00:15

Hey, I finally showed up.
Probably the reason you're having trouble running ZC is that it's a position-independent executable, which can cause the OS to mistake it for a library.
The proper way to fix it would be to create a .desktop file, but it should also work if it's built with the `-no-pie` flag.

=== @ Saffith 03/07/2022 00:18

Executables don't normally use file extensions on Linux. You shouldn't add one; it might cause it to be mistaken for something else.
For the sound library, try running `ldd zelda` and looking for `libzcsound.so` in the output. That should at least tell you whether there's a problem with the file or it's not seeing it at all for some reason.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/07/2022 02:57

Saffith! Welcome back!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/07/2022 03:00

I know Emily was running into some issues compiling that cropped up, but I'm unsure if those were just the usual lack of sound effects or a new issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/07/2022 03:00

I have no fucking clue how to properly compile linux
I had it working sort of for a bit
but then it stopped working
and I couldn't get it working again

=== @ Saffith 03/07/2022 03:36

Maybe I'll finally actually look into it. I can probably at least get a build without sound together again.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/07/2022 03:37

apparently building with sound will require rebuilding allegro
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/issues/707

=== @ Saffith 03/07/2022 03:38

I'll be sure to try that.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/07/2022 03:41

wait
do you know how to compile allegro?
That's like a big holdup for us

=== @ Saffith 03/07/2022 03:42

Nope.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/07/2022 03:42

Crud.

=== @ Saffith 03/07/2022 03:42

But maybe I'll figure it out.

=== @ Saffith 03/12/2022 23:59

```
~/Games/Zelda Classic/2.55 Linux$ ./zelda
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
~/Games/Zelda Classic/2.55 Linux$ ./zquest

Yay, progress

That's what I was getting last time

But printf doesn't actually recurse, so... Hm.
I wonder if something in there is a macro that invokes printf.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/13/2022 00:03

Uhg, yay
My main goal with Linux at the moment is to get console output working
Considering the new parser uses console output to report compile errors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/13/2022 00:04

...I also definitely don't have anywhere near enough linux experience to do so competently

=== @ Saffith 03/13/2022 00:15

... Oh wait a second, it totally recurses. Just glossing over it, I guess.

=== @ Saffith 03/13/2022 00:16

Well, now it's at least opening a window before it crashes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/13/2022 00:23

Nice
Where was that recursing?

=== @ Saffith 03/13/2022 00:30

Right at the end:
```
    printf("%s",tmp);
    return ret;
```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/13/2022 00:30

Pfft
I think that was meant to be `::printf`
Gotta love name overlap

=== @ Saffith 03/13/2022 00:32

Yeah, always a fun time.
I don't do much C++ anymore, and there's a lot that annoys me coming back to it.
Even better when it's a standard library thing and all you can do is rename something. :p

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/13/2022 00:33

I try to avoid similar names for this exact reason
But, Zoria clearly gave no shits

=== @ Saffith 03/13/2022 00:34

Yep, sounds like him.

=== @ Saffith 03/13/2022 02:25

I put in a PR with the changes so far. The next problem is going to be more of a pain.
MsgStr has a std::string instead of a char* now. MsgStrings is malloced and zeroed, and a zeroed std::string isn't valid in the implementation I've got.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/13/2022 02:26

ah crap
pretty sure `MsgStr` has a `.clear()` function
that could be used instead of zeroing it

=== @ Saffith 03/13/2022 02:28

Thing is, it actually crashes trying to assign to the string, and it's invalid even when it's first allocated.

=== @ Saffith 03/13/2022 02:29

Anyway, I'll fiddle with it. It'll work one way or another.
