typing in the text fields feels laggy

=== @ Deathrider 07/16/2023 23:14

String editor also has this issue

=== @ Deathrider 07/18/2023 02:25

navigating the screen enemies dialogue with arrow keys also feels laggy

(meta) thread name was changed: More text fields and dialogues feel laggy

so
- listers with key input
- typing in texfields (there are a few types of textfields, so it might only be some)

(replying to @ Deathrider "navigating the screen enemies…"): I cannot reproduce this.
(replying to @ Deathrider "String editor also has this i…"): This I can.
FYI emily in case you ever need to fix these sorts of bugs: best approach I've found is to disable this "just in case" kludge:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1130272985316610150/1131371792133525504/image.png?ex=65e90097&is=65d68b97&hm=33e6a3b555f01adf625174fa202bbbfd43b41830b4d344720d79aa339ef6eef4&)
then nothing updates at all
(then you find what old dialog code must change)

this typically means someplace just needs a `d->flags |= D_DIRTY`

=== @ Deathrider 07/20/2023 00:16

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I cannot reproduce this."): Navigating up and down with the arrow keys? I can double check

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 22:46

Is this fixed?

=== @ Deathrider 07/30/2023 05:11

yes
