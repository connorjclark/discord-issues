=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/03/2023 20:50

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) ffcCountMarkDirty() is only called for the player, not for ZQ. This means that ZQ doesn't save new FFCs.
(pinging cause IIRC you're the one who made this change; apologies if I'm misremembering)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/03/2023 20:52

(ffcCountMarkDirty is only called in screen_ffc_modify_postroutine, which has a bunch of is_player checks surrounding every place it seems to be called)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/03/2023 20:56

presumably it should be called each time an ffcs data coule be changed, so ffc.setdata might be the best place to call it. The problem is that has no access to the screen of the ffc; it only has tmpscr access I think

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 21:12

.....yeah connor you want to double check this commit
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/f806c89845bf76101b26690cb8c4ced300d03f96
default ctors are NOT doing the same thing that was being done before in several places
immediately notice `screen_midi`, `secretsfx`, `holdupsfx`
....assuming that the function named `zero_memory` actually sets everything to `0` was not a good assumption
(blame whoever named it)
(meta) thread name was changed: FFC and mapscr issues

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/03/2023 21:22

Oh, I didn't realize you could initialize stuff in the class declaration
That's real fancy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 21:23

mm, yeah
so just need to do that for the mapscr stuff that was missed, and fix the `ffcCountMarkDirty` however that needs to work in zq

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2023 22:01

Seems good time to add some replay comments for sfx too

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/03/2023 22:34

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) have you fixed or started work on fixing this yet? If not I *think* I might be able to fix it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/03/2023 22:35

but I don't want to merge conflict if you've already started fixing it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2023 22:46

No I have work today
Go for it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2023 22:57

also `layeropacity`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2023 22:59

even tho it's an array should still be able to define the default value in the header so the default ctor sets to that. `byte layeropacity[6] = {255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255}` i guess

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:39

I'm fixing the default values now.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:40

oop
I just woke up and fixed them haha
I can revert tho

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:40

mhmmm just drop it?
Or push it
whatever.
I'm also waiting for the CI to pass..

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:41

I haven't staged it yet so easy enough to discard

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:41

so, if you're not doing that... let me continue on the issue of the default values.
you can do the zq bit

ya?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:42

That's all I found, ye

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:43

I was very annoyed that `byte layeropacity[6] = {255}` just sets the first value to 255, rest to 0. i thought cpp was better than that

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:43

oooof, I would not have caught that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:44

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I was very annoyed that `byte‚Ä¶"): when you suggested that
I was going to question it
but I assumed you knew something I didn't XD

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:44

I wasn't going to question it because I assumed new C++ version, new way of handling haha

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:44

i gave c++ too much credit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:44

lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:44

https://www.techiedelight.com/initialize-elements-array-same-value-c-cpp/ see, I was reading this site
and this site implied that it would have worked
sad üò¶

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:45

That implies that it works *for the value 0 only*

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:45

ugh.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:46

```cpp
int arr[5] = { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
 
// or don't specify the size
int arr[] = { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 };

//
int arr[5] = {};    // results in [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
int arr[5] = { 0 };  // results in [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]```
for the `1` initializers it specifies every value
but apparently specifying a single 0, or an empty initializer, will set the whole array to 0

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:46

Anyways I'm unsure if my solution to handling the FFC saving side is the *best*; I just found all the places it would be relevant to mark the ffc as unsaved and called the markasdirty function
```To initialize an array in C/C++ with the same value, the naive way is to provide an initializer list like,```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:47

Apparently GCC compilers specifically would allow ```cpp
int layeropacity[6] = {[0...5] = 255};```

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:47

immediately above the two examples; keyword "naive"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:47

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Anyways I'm unsure if my solu‚Ä¶"): it should only matter when the FFC's combo changes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:48

ye

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:48

So, on Paste FFC, Create New FFC, or Edit FFC->OK

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:48

if you want to be lazy you could just do it in the main loop, maybe..

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:48

See, this would have been a lot easier
with the ffc storing the pointer to parent
like I did before

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:48

Eh, I'm sure there's a reason
wasn't hard to work around

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:49

because then you could just have the `setData` function do `parent->markAsDirty()`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:49

It introduced complications for z3.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:49

ah, fair.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:49

having the struct be just a POD thing is simpler
the pointers makes a lot of stuff more difficult to manage (in terms of copying)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:50

....err
though wait
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) could you not just
copy the loop that's in the `IS_PLAYER` check

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:50

I only did it now b/c it helped me realize a bugfix in my branch when I could just copy things trivially

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:50

but use the zq current screen instead of tmpscr

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:50

The problem is that saving saves every screen in the quest
and also I don't know if there's a way to edit ffcs from another screen or not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:51

I'm pretty sure there isn't

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:51

I pushed my changes, feel free to look over if I did a dumb

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:51

Combos there is because of layers
but ffc layers don't exist
placing/editing ffcs always goes on layer 0
....frankly, how painful would it be to just forcibly recount every screen when saving?
that way nothing could possibly cause issues there

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:52

probably not that painful
Might do that as well
Ah, I see why I wasn't sure
ffc editor's save ffdata lets you specify a screen

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:55

...Theoretically, can the ffc editoredit ffcs of other screens if hooked up?
Cause it takes a screen value

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:56

fuck, I should have pushed to a branch and merged instead of pushing to main
Never think of that until I've already pushed, need to start doing that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:57

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "...Theoretically, can the ffc‚Ä¶"): .....yes, though I don't even know what use that would have?
Because like, how would you open the editor for another screen's FFC
you can't rclick->edit it
because it.... isn't on the current screen
That function takes a screen
.....because I didn't want to hardcode bullshit with jank terrible code

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:57

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:57

that's just called clean code
it does not and should not imply that editing for not the current screen is at all a good idea

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:58

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "if you want to be lazy you co‚Ä¶"): or in `update_hw_screen`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 01:59

I see no reason to recount every 'frame'
I don't know what in ZQ even uses the count
aside from saving

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 01:59

nothing would get the numFfc and loop on it?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 01:59

pasting another screen's ffcs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 02:00

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 02:00

yeah, there's a few places that it's called

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 02:00

Like I said, probably *something*, just nothing I can think of
like 99% of the ffc stuff is zc-only

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 02:00

Not opposed to the lazy solution, just, didn't think of it at the time and I already did a less lazy (but still probably not optimal) solution

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2023 02:02

I just added the call to update it in like 5 places; When you clear an FFC, when you paste an FFC, two places when loading a quest (because it didn't look like it dirtied it and I was a bit paranoid), and when you save an ffc in the ffc editor
Should probably add the call when saving it too
