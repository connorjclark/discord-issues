I wasn't sure if I should put this in a new thread or just revive the old one, but to be safe I just made a new thread. I feel like it would be better if the overlay functionality was more consistent with the usage of `Shift + o` for single tile regions and large tile blocks.

I think it would make more sense for a copied 1x1 tile to be pasted into all the tiles of a selected region with `o`, and `shift + o` would only paste a single tile into the region. This would be opposite of how it works currently.

I think multi-tile copied sections should stay the same, with `o` overlaying the whole copied section, and `shift + o` only overlaying a single tile.

Of course this should extrapolate to under-laying as well but I left those key combinations out for simplicity's sake. I'm not sure how difficult this would be but assuming it is just swapping a couple of conditions around, I think it would make more sense to function this way.
