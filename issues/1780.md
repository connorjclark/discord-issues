Similar to the Hookshot/Switchhook Grab flags, add Hookshot/Ladder/Switchhook Only flags so those items can pass through any combo with those flags

or a QR that renders switchhooks the same as hookshots on the Hookshot/Ladder flag

(replying to @ vlamart "Similar to the Hookshot/Switc…"): ...err, this already exists as a flag??
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "or a QR that renders switchho…"): switchhooks ARE hookshots
just in disguise
like, they literally use ALL of the hookshot code, except when they hit something
combo types

Yes, I mean add them as check boxes next to the other two about hookshots and switchhooks so all combos can use those

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/26/2022 23:35

oh...
bleh
ok, that makes sense as a request
but uh
...bleh
not happening any time soon
maybe at some point if I feel like digging more into that shit

(replying to @ vlamart "Yes, I mean add them as check…"): Maybe move them to its own separate tab in the combo editor, and add more check boxes for passable directions of weapon
