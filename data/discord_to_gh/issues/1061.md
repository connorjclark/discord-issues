I'm using Windows 10 and I have Avast. Before the latest 2.55 alpha and nightly builds, I was able to do these things, but now I'm not even getting pop up warnings and I've played around with the settings for quite a bit to no avail.

If a security program is preventing it, there's nothing we can do about it

his antivirus says NO

??? If there's something different in the alpha that's causing it though, but to not happen in previous alphas, is that not something that should be identified?

Security programs have been yelling at us for literally years
and, nothing remotely to do with exporting or screenshotting has changed recently whatsoever
so chances of it being a change actually related are next to none
meaning it's probably just the security programs being the viruses they are

Could've put that a little more eloquently, but thanks for the clarification anyways lmao
