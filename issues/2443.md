This is most assuredly something new, because it wasn't happening in earlier versions and seems to be getting worse and worse with each nightly. I thought maybe it was an issue on my end, but others have mentioned having it as well. 

As far as I can tell, it seems like the slowdown reaches its peak in screens in quests where heavy scripting is in action. I was replaying GoGollab 1 in the latest nightly for example, and the slowdown would spike in certain screens (Path of Failures is a good reference point as that's where most of the slowdown was), and the longer the tape recorder was used, the game would slowdown more and more, and then go back to normal when turned off. This isn't a Gollab exclusive issue, it seems to be happening in multiple quests, primarily with heavy scripting, something that most definitely didn't occur in the past.

I haven't seen anybody report this, so I'm reporting it here now for that reason, before it potentially gets any worse.

Can you load up the same screen in a few of the recent alphas to help narrow down the problem? Using the fps as an indicator.

Until it's resolved, a possible workaround is to enable jit compilation. I suggest checking the precompile option too. You'll pay a couple minutes cost upfront  on every game load (and I think continue?), but it should significantly speed up scripts. The cost is only that much for the super heavy scripted quests. For others it's seconds or less.

=== @ Haylee 06/11/2023 23:11

I don't have any other recent builds on my PC currently aside from the latest build but I can get images of one of these at least, gimme a bit

=== @ Haylee 06/11/2023 23:23

You were right that JIT Script Compilation fixes the slowdown entirely in spite of the load time increase

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 08:04

I'll look into this soon. @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) what dmap/screen would the above area be?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/01/2023 10:35

Dmap 96 screen 00

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/01/2023 10:39

```(Path of Failures is a good reference point as that's where most of the slowdown was)``` dmap 64 screen 75 is the entrance of this dungeon
no clue if any screens in particular or not
And the Tape Recorder item is a zz130 item class item if you want to cheat yourself it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 20:45

>  dmap 64 screen 75 is the entrance of this dungeon 

I'm not seeing  this  there @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
is https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&id=731 the right quest

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 20:53

ok I'm stumbling around on this too much. I can look into it if someone provides me a replay file showing the new slowdown

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:19

I was debugging some other slowdown I noticed, and found that I had this option in my `zc.cfg` that _really_ did a number to FPS on certain screen in "freedom of chains".

```
[CONSOLE]
ZScript_Debugger = 1
```

@ Einsiety is this on in your config too?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:22

Namely, I saw tons of this printed to the console during the slowdown:

```
Script attempted to reference a nonexistent LWeapon!
You were trying to reference the Y of an LWeapon with UID = 0; LWeapons on screen are UIDs 
Script attempted to reference a nonexistent LWeapon!
You were trying to reference the HitYOffset of an LWeapon with UID = 0; LWeapons on screen are UIDs 
Script attempted to reference a nonexistent LWeapon!
You were trying to reference the HitWidth of an LWeapon with UID = 0; LWeapons on screen are UIDs 
Script attempted to reference a nonexistent LWeapon!
```

Though this may just be an OSX problem...fixing upsteam in allegro: https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5/pull/1452

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:46

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I was debugging some other sl…"): aye, having the console open would cause slowdown if it's spitting errors- closing the console window should stop the slowdown though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:46

It shouldn't be noticeable though. With my above patch on my mac there is no difference really w/ or w/o the debugger.
I'm not sure if windows is waiting for another thread to ack tho.
OSX obv. was.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:47

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "It shouldn't be noticeable th…"): it is VERY VERY obvious difference on windows

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:47

Then it must be waiting on something, or we have an awful perf bug somewhere, cuz just spitting text to another process should be _fast_
i'll look on my windows machine now...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:48

eh, zasm debugger isn't properly tested enough for it to be used as a baseline though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:48

ZASM debugger yeah is heavy duty, lots of processing stuff going on there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:48

but with zscript printouts

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:48

but the zscript debugger is just a console

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:48

yeah
it's still quite noticably slower
and, like, even internal `zprint2()` logs to the ZQ debugger
I just had a moment where I had to taskkill ZQ because I accidentally opened the wrong dialog with a debug statement printing
and what would normally take a couple seconds to open was taking over a minute
because of all the logs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:49

I feel like the windows impl here is not waiting for another thread, like OSX was https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5/blob/master/addons/native_dialog/win_dialog.c#L696
but idk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:50

```cpp
int32_t CConsoleLoggerEx::_cprint(int32_t attributes,const char *lpszText,int32_t iSize)
{
    DWORD dwWritten=(DWORD)-1;
    // we assume that in iSize < 2^24 , because we're using only 3 bytes of iSize 
    // 32BIT: send DWORD = 4bytes: one byte is the command (COMMAND_CPRINT) , and 3 bytes for size
    DWORD command_plus_size = (COMMAND_CPRINT <<24)| iSize;
    EnterCriticalSection();
    if ( !WriteFile (m_hPipe, &command_plus_size,sizeof(DWORD),&dwWritten,NULL) 
        || dwWritten != sizeof(DWORD))
    {
        LeaveCriticalSection();
        return -1;
    }
    
    command_plus_size = attributes;    // reuse of the prev variable
    if ( !WriteFile (m_hPipe, &command_plus_size,sizeof(DWORD),&dwWritten,NULL) 
        || dwWritten != sizeof(DWORD))
    {
        LeaveCriticalSection();
        return -1;
    }
    
    int32_t iRet = (!WriteFile( m_hPipe,lpszText,iSize,&dwWritten,NULL)
        || (int32_t)dwWritten!=iSize) ? -1 : (int32_t)dwWritten;
    LeaveCriticalSection();
    return iRet;
}```
I have no clue about half of this shit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:51

ohhhh we arent using allegro native text log for windows

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:51

but this is the key thing the windows logger uses

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:51

thats right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:51

yeah, it's custom

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:51

cuz theres no fancy color

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:51

*by zoria*
so

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:52

The debug console is very Windows-only, so I just opted to use a dumb log window from allegro when I ported that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:53

for windows `WriteFile`
this definitely looks like it's not doing async
so it's waiting for the write

....especially given `PIPE_WAIT`?
ffs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:55

cool
I'll fix this up, or did you want to?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 21:55

god I don't want to touch it lol
this looks atrocious XD
if this can be made faster though that'll be a GREAT improvement

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:56

Confirmed similar slowdown with the same thing I tested on OSX.
you'll see it too w/ `python tests/run_replay_tests.py --filter freedom_in_chains.zplay --frame 20000`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 22:37

Pushed a fix for the zscript debugger performance problem. Leaving this open until Haylee can confirm if she had the debugger on.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 22:46

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Pushed a fix for the zscript…"): HOLY ABSOLUTE FUCK
Just tested putting back the debug prints I was just using a bit ago
which made opening `Init Data` take multiple MINUTES
.....and with this fix, I can open and close Init Data multiple times in a single SECOND.
This is an improvement of like, several THOUSAND times speed for console tracing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 18:19

@ Einsiety is this fixed for you?

=== @ Haylee 07/03/2023 18:41

I have since got a new PC that runs significantly better, so I haven't been able to actually test it for myself, because I haven't lagged on this PC at all

=== @ Haylee 07/03/2023 18:42

Sorry I can't be of more help

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 18:42

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I was debugging some other sl…"): (pretty sure this was the problem)
Do you ever turn the zscript debugger on?

=== @ Haylee 07/03/2023 18:43

nah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 18:43

darn, then that isn't it! ohwell

=== @ Haylee 07/03/2023 18:43

I typically keep it off LMAO

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 18:43

OK - feel free to open another bug report if it happens again.

=== @ Haylee 07/03/2023 18:43

👍 np

=== @ Haylee 07/03/2023 18:45

The only slowdown I get now is ZQuest when I screenshare it, but that might be entirely related to just be my PC and discord CPU usage related.
