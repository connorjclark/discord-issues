Trying to set npc->Jump with a script while an NPC is on a platform in sideview will have it reverted the next frame. Setting it while in the air seems to work fine.

Somehow this is broken all the way back to 2.50. Kinda stunned it never came up. I guess because everybody used ghost and ghost fakes all jump related mechanics

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Could you explain this code block to me?
```                    zfix fall_amnt = fall/100;
                    bool hit = false;
                    while(fall_amnt >= 1)
                    {
                        --fall_amnt;
                        ++y;
                        if(isOnSideviewPlatform())
                        {
                            y = y.getInt();
                            fall_amnt = 0;
                            hit = true;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    if(fall_amnt > 0)
                        y += fall_amnt;
                    if(fall_amnt < 0)
                    {
                        if(!movexy(0,fall_amnt,spw_none))
                            hit = true;
                    }```
I feel like I'm Mooshblinding something. I can see in the player that it can handle negative jump, but this code looks like it should only be handling positive.

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 15:20

wait yup, I'm Mooshblinding. That last if is the negative jump and the while just doesn't run there? Not sure I understand why it needs the additional stepification of the downward movement

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 15:22

Also the way it does ++y before checking platform collision may be responsible for

?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/14/2024 15:35

So, this is for platforms, as in the `Sideview Platform` flag
keep in mind that it's `fall` internally, not `jump`, so `negative fall` is `positive jump`
so, the top part of this applies only while moving *downward*
which makes sense, since you jump upward *through* sideview platforms

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 15:40

isOnSideviewPlatform() appears to be checked for everything though
Solids, slopes, and ladders/platforms
I assume having that function return false if fall is negative would be the first part of the solution. As any time a sprite is rising it shouldn't be considered "on the ground"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/14/2024 15:45

(replying to @ Moosh "I assume having that function…"): ..probably smart

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 15:45

```                        if(!movexy(0,fall_amnt,spw_none))
                            hit = true;```
Then the second part seems to be this movexy
It's not using ignore sideview
so it can never go up
which is the one thing it's meant to do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/14/2024 15:45

oh...

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 15:56

looks like all the other sprite types have the same flaw. Glad I bothered to check

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 16:47

What the hell is thiiiiiis
```if(fall!=0 && !(step>0 && dir==up))  // Don't fix pos if still moving through solidness```

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 17:16

okay, fixed. Avoiding adding any ceiling interaction for things that didn't have it since that feels more like a feature than a bug and because I can't make heads or tails of some of this behavior
I fear for what replays this change will fail 😬

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 17:21

Well maybe not any. FiC has a lot of sideview jank but I don't think any of my scripts played with jump.

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 17:38

fffffffffffffffffffffffu-

Moosh can you push to a branch first before main?
If you're unsure about replays

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 18:21

Yeah sorry, popped into my head after the fact

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 18:33

Issue seems to be any time the fire bombs are used, the fires must've had a jump value making them travel slightly faster upwards. Makes me think this needs a compat QR, which bothers me because I really wanted this fix to be applied to 2.55

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 20:06

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) Sorry for the ping but just wanna make 100% certain before I screw things up any further: is it okay to add a compatibility QR to 2.55 for this given that both have the same V_COMPATRULE? Would that break things? I assume so but want to make sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/14/2024 20:07

versionwise, if they were at the same V_COMPATRULE (which, really? they've stayed the same?), then I don't see an issue

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 20:10

https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/main/src/base/zdefs.h
https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/releases/2.55/src/base/zdefs.h
Seems so. I was surprised too. Would've thought we'd have added one since

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/14/2024 22:46

Agreed, it should be fine.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/14/2024 22:49

just checking but the differences you see here: https://zc-replay-compare-7904896426.surge.sh/ you consider breaking right? not fixing an issue?
at a glance it does _look better_

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/14/2024 22:50

what I'm getting at - is this better as a QR or a replay bump (or just checking "qst", as before, which I prefer when its just a single replay -- also `--update` is fine too.... sometimes I avoid updating a replay for no reason other than trying to reduce how much git LFS bandwidth we use, which isnt a very good reason)

=== @ Moosh 02/14/2024 23:37

It threw off the timing of the puzzle at the end by changing the distance the fire travelled. I worry it might throw off the timing in something more precise than what I was working with here, in another quest that was unintentionally working around broken behavior

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/14/2024 23:38

Makes sense, thanks for explaining
