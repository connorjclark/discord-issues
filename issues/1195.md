A 'slippery' combo of some sort, with attributes to allow different levels of acceleration and such.
Perhaps a pokemon-style forced sliding version, as well

A setting to keep a percentage of Link's momentum on entering ice combos would be nice. Also script access to ice X and Y velocities

aye, certainly good ideas

How about "ice push blocks" that keep moving until it hits solid, liquid, or pit?

^ in push block settling code, *if not from switchhook*, and landing on ice, check if can continue in current direction; if so, double speed (start 0.5, cap 4), and continue.
Switchhook check should be doable as it starts with step 0.
This would be a floor ice combo, with a flag `Affects pushed blocks`.

Similarly, there could be an `Icy Block` combo type, and when that is pushed, it acts as though all ground is ice, running the same code otherwise.

The first time the block detects the ice, it should play a `Slip` SFX set on the combo (set on the Icy Block for that method)
If the ice is set to act as 'pokemon-style' for Link, it should play the same SFX
if it's just slippery, probably no sfx?

offhand, attributes needed for ice combos would be:
-Initial Velocity (absolute? multplier? not sure)
-Acceleration
-Deceleration
-Max Speed
with flags
-Pokemon-style (if checked, none of the above attributes matter, instead of just has a 'Speed' attribute for how fast you move in a forced straight line)
-Affects Blocks (see above)

Also, as an idea for 'traction boots', have a 'Traction Modifier' - multipliest the deceleration, cuts the acceleration. If 0, disables ice entirely. (1 would do nothing, higher would make ice less slippery)
