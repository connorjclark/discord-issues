Making a report as a record of this so I don't forget. Looked into it a couple days ago, but the code involved is rather messy and I'm not confident I can fix without introducing new bugs. 

```                    int32_t h = e->takehit(w);
                    if (h == -1) 
                    { 
                        e->hitby[HIT_BY_LWEAPON] = i+1;
                        e->hitby[HIT_BY_LWEAPON_UID] = w->script_UID;
                        e->hitby[HIT_BY_LWEAPON_TYPE] = w->id;
                        if (w->parentitem > -1) e->hitby[HIT_BY_LWEAPON_PARENT_FAMILY] = itemsbuf[w->parentitem].family; 
                        else e->hitby[HIT_BY_LWEAPON_PARENT_FAMILY] = -1;
                        e->hitby[HIT_BY_LWEAPON_PARENT_ID] = w->parentitem;
                        e->hitby[HIT_BY_LWEAPON_ENGINE_UID] = w->getUID();
                        
                    }```
Happens starting from this block. It's using -1 for things that do damage, but piercing returns 0 in this function as if the weapon is being ignored. There's also a tangled web of other return values for functions relating to getting hit and enemy defenses
