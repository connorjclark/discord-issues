Using the Item->Load function in the item selector in the item editor dialogue also copies the item's data to the next item in the list.

This doesn't seem to be consistient across all items

Copied Ring data over Item 18, which was a zz item in this quest. Didn't affect anything later on in the item list
Which probably means it has to do with itemclasses, as the items affected were the next ID down in the same itemclass

Okay, it does affect things of different itemclasses
Had it copy over the Peril Beam scroll instead of the Bracelet when I copied over Item 17

It also copied the Magic Wallet when I copied over Item 18

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 04:23

So it went from Item 17 (Ring) to Item 103 (Peril Beam) and from Item 18 (Itemclass 67) to Item 104 (Wallet).

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 04:24

The other items affected went from Item 144 to Item 145 (both Itemclass 255) and Item 150 (itemclass 255) to Item 151 (Rupee)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 04:30

Is it setting both, or is it only setting the 'wrong' one?

=== @ Orithan 04/07/2022 05:41

Both the intended item and the "wrong" item

This
I fucking swear
Zoria
why are you fucking
copying the data of the item to one place
and assigning it to a fucking other place as well
When you copy it, is the name being changed for the correct or incorrect item?
It should, if I'm right, only be being loaded to one of them
given that commented out line
