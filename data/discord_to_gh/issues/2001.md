Separate from the windows scaling issues documented in the other thread. It would seem that, when ZC is resized to resolutions by dragging the bottom corner, text and sprites become distorted.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 02:18

Distorted in what way?

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 02:20

Blurred and uneven
Lemme grab an example

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 02:22

Compare the eyes. Before and after dragging to resize

Or look at how the heart icons on the subscreen are visible distorted after resizing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 02:30

are you resizing it to exactly 2x or 3x or etc size?
if not, then slight distortion.... will happen. that's how resizing works.
I can frankly *barely* tell

=== @ Jared 11/04/2022 03:21

I can’t tell either tbh

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 04:31

Trust me when I say it gets noticeable with small text. It's quite hard to read it.
And given that "Just drag to resize" was presented as the solution to the scaling issues still not being fixed, it's a bit annoying

=== @ Majora 11/04/2022 04:47

Given that zc's base resolution is so tiny, scaling at anything but multiples will always be distorted.
This would happen in any program with small base resolution
Unless it was a program that was natively 1080p but pretending to render at a low resolution

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 07:11

Do these scaling issues occur in the browser version too?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 07:40

Is this build any different: https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-11-04

@ Moosh 
@ vlamart

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/04/2022 12:28

I'm curious if these issues would be fixed if there was an option for ZC to antialias it's scaling
I have no idea how good it'd look (probably terrible), but I imagine it'd make text more readable at least

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 15:09

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "are you resizing it to exactl…"): FWIW, while pixel art and stuff works fine at exact multiples, default allegro text does not

Launching at 960x720 from the launcher yields this ugly meny

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:10

.....what???
...oh, err
960x720 is `1.5`

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 15:11

But if the pixel art works at 1.5, shouldn't the menu text?
Like, shouldn't it be an all or nothing thing?
Either the program can properly accommodate 1.5 or it can't

=== @ vlamart 11/04/2022 15:11

Even if you barely accidentally knick any the window size arrows, all "n" look like "r"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:11

...the pixels look perfect?

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 15:11

As far as I can tell

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:11

I would be surprised for 1.5 giving perfect pixels
....oh
though I go to 2x
and the text looks like shit
soooo

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 15:12

So it's a problem at literally any scaling level with allegro text

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:12

that seems really weird

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 15:37

Are people just going to ignore both of my questions trying to resolve this?
(replying to @ Russ ""): Or was this from the test build I posted???

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:40

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Do these scaling issues occur…"): ^
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Is this build any different:…"): ^
@ Russ ?

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 15:47

Will have to give both a shot

=== @ vlamart 11/04/2022 15:59

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Is this build any different:…"): Looks _much_ better

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 15:59

Its so weird, I can't notice any difference. But I'm on a different OS with a very high density display so idk?

=== @ vlamart 11/04/2022 16:01

And I'm on a poopoo rock basically can only handle ZC at this point laptop

=== @ Majora 11/04/2022 16:01

Nah there's always been distortion on things when in a bigger window
Certain columns of pixels stretched to accommodate non multiple scale
And especially in the text

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:02

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Is this build any different:…"): Yes. Problem seems fixed in this build
I can drag it to whatever weird size I want and I'm not noticing any particular egregious distortion, be it on the sprites or on allegro text

=== @ vlamart 11/04/2022 16:03

I mean, it's fuzzy, but when I just resize the window all free-form, text doesn't distort like it did before. It was most noticeable in the `Edit ZScript` window, now "n" doesn't become "r" with arbitrary scaling

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 19:27

So we're happier with this test build? @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) should I merge?
check fullscreen too just in case

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 19:29

if people think it's better, then certainly
What did this change specifically?

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 19:30

It seems like a definite improvement to me. I'll check fullscreen and make sure no oddities there

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 19:36

Fullscreen works fine

=== @ vlamart 11/04/2022 19:37

Yup

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 19:50

It changed the default behavior being nearest neighbor to being a linear interpolation
Hence why it help better with text

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 19:51

How easy would it be to put this on a config?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 19:52

As long as the scaling is the right aspect ratio (which it always is), this should be similar to NN for the pixel artwork I think
Easy, I'll do that and default to linear.
Just can't change at runtime

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 19:53

sounds perfect
