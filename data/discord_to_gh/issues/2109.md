Feed The NPC:
Bait Level: The bait is required to be this level to satisfy/kill the Goriya. Old quests are 0

Triforce Amount Check:
Minimum Triforces: The triforce pieces up to and including this number must be collected to satisfy/kill the Guy. For example, set this to 3 to have the Old Man ask for Triforce Pieces 1, 2, and 3, and disappear if you have all three of those. Old quests are 3, 4, 6, or 8 depending on the QRs

Magic Usage Divisor:
Power: The player's Magic is halved this many times. For example, set it to 2 to give the player 1/4 Magic in one room. I'd actually suggest having this divide your magic by the said amount (for example, if the Power is 3, you have 1/3 Magic), but that might be too hard. Old quests are 1

1. Saying `old quests are X` doesn't work
because scripts can use that value in 2.50.2
so it can't be overwritten
2. Dividing magic by 3 would work, except, if your magic multiplier is not a multiple of 3, it would end up rounding and not being actually a third
so, requires proper setup of the magic multiplier value
(`Magic Drain Rate` in Init Data)

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "1. Saying `old quests are X`…"): This means that adding things like this won't really work well, and in general you are asking for compat problems.
.....however, we could just.... add new room types?
`Feed NPC Custom` as a room type, that takes that room data?
`Tri Check Custom` for a custom number of pieces
`Magic Rate Custom` to divide your magic by whatever value
....that could work as a way to implement it which would not fuck with compat in any way.
and like, there are so few room types, so, adding more isn't anywhere near any sort of limit

=== @ P-Tux7 12/25/2022 03:11

Yeah, that'd make sense. You could just have the new code run when the quest is over a certain version, but that would be simpler to code.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/25/2022 03:17

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Yeah, that'd make sense. You…"): things like this instantly break old quests that are re-saved
so you need to lock it behind a compat QR, not a version check
which is annoying

=== @ P-Tux7 12/25/2022 03:20

oh yuck mm
i'd also suggest to have some sort of custom ordering to move the deprecated room types to the bottom of the list after these better ones get added
(meta) thread name was changed: Replacements for Uncustomizable Room Types

I think my latest feature request was a little more involved than this, but anyway, the hardcoded Lv. 9 Triforce Room might not work if the questmaker wants two sets of collection items (Zelda x Dark Souls prototype, LttP variants, etc.), or a different type of reaction for the Triforce room, like a battle if you bring in collectable items
I know I have certainly ran into difficulty without using scripts anytime I have tried to have two sets of "level" collection items

=== @ P-Tux7 05/20/2023 21:19

The battle thing is somewhat easy, you make enemies -> secret and have warps to the battle

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 21:20

How would you work that?

=== @ P-Tux7 05/20/2023 21:20

Hmm... I'll try to make example quests later

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 21:20

Say you drag into the room Level Collection Items 9-16 after triggering the Triforce room in the other round

=== @ P-Tux7 05/20/2023 21:20

Though I already have one in the works for someone who requested a more-than-three-item "Take Only One" room that uses combos that give you the items when stepped upon LOL
So this one will have to wait a day or two

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 21:20

DM me later, I'll give you the write-up
And the prototype
People are going to NEED this if they're going to do LttP variants

=== @ P-Tux7 05/20/2023 21:21

Okay, but I need to implement it in a blank quest before I implement it in yours so that other people can use it as a tutorial

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 21:22

Good enough

If I don't get to it today remind me tomorow:  In the middle of testing a cutscene ATM
