Frankly this one seems like the most reasonable of the ideas I just opened
It'd need some expanded counters, for each type of seed
the biggest problem would be adding some sort of subscreen code to handle selecting one
especially in B-only, where you don't actually press a button to choose; it'd have to like... pop up when you close the subscreen or something

Would probably want some combo types or something, like maybe a `Mystery Seed -> String` for the talking owls
I hesitate to add Secret Combos, as that expands `mapscr`, which is like, very memory tip-toe zone
Scent Seeds are kinda just bait when used from the satchel
but like, stronger
Gale would need a warp menu of some variety
....hmm
really, the *basic foundation* should be easy
but each of the seed types is its' own big challenge

frankly the subscreen code and enemy code required are probably a bit much
so this might be better saved for the rewrite when systems are clean slate
(meta) thread name was changed: ⏱🔒Seed Satchel+Shooter - Do I dare?
marked: remember for rewrite
