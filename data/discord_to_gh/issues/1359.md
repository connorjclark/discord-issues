Some scripts that in 2.53 worked fine, have outright stopped working. I mean ghosted enemy scripts that use writing into NPC->OriginalTile for processing animation. Here are some scripts and the quest for reproducing.

This rule should also affect 2-frame, 3-frame and 4-frame animations.

...those shouldn't need a rule
