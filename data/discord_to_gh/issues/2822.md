I initially thought this was a super serious bug but... well here it is.

Load some quest, any really, and select cset 4. cool. Now load classic_1st.qst, and be confused when the entire combo pane goes black.

Well classic_1st does not use cset 4, that's why its black. I didn't know that I thought everything was broken.

We should either reset Cset to a known good thing (I guess 2 is always nice?), or remember the cset used for a quest last time it was loaded (via quest-specific config values)
