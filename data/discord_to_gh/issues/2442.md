Tried writing am Active dmap script and could not get it to run no matter what. Here's a test quest with a new dmapdata script assigned to dmap 0. If it were working it'd print to the console and then kill Link. 

On checking "Output ZASM to Allegro.log" it's not showing up at all

Tested some areas in Stellar Seas that were using dmapdata scripts though and everything worked fine there. So this seems to be ZQuest side

I may be having a similar issue where any change made to my active subscreen script is not reflected in ZC
removing or tampering with the script does what you would expect in ZQ, but if I were to say add draws to my active SS nothing changes in ZC

@ Deathrider does your passive still work?
i.e. is the active, slot 1, the only one that is broken

=== @ Deathrider 06/11/2023 19:27

my passive is busted as well

I can also check my HeatedRooms to see if all DMap slots are messed up
