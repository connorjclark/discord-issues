there are some items that have multiple sound effects tied to them. And i think it'd be neat to add more sound affects to the action tab of the item editor to make each item sound more unique from eachother.
examples:
-sword beam+peril beam+cross beam
-bomb+super bomb place
-din's fire rise+fall
- nayru's love out+in
- lens on+off
- quake+super quake pound
-spin+hurricane spin+quake+super quake charge

Isn't the lens sfx set by the item edtor? Sorry i never use that item and IDR
If not shod be simple to adapt
most of these belong in a genera sfx menu

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 05:49

the point being, the lens has a separate on/off sound
and you can't just select both

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 05:50

the lens is a general sfx
but i want these to be item specific for purely for customization reasons

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 05:51

like when i shoot a sword beam from a stick
and shoot a sword beam from a sword of legendary proportions
i kinda expect them to sound different lol
just thought it would be cosmetically beneficial

a lot of requests i have mostly are intended to expand upon what's already there.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 08:21

well the lens one is an easy matter
have the user select one sound for on
and the sound directly after that one is used for off
i think the same can work for all the others
bombs being firstly explode then place (or vice versa)
though you could likely set a unique sound for peril beam and cross beam scrolls, no hacks needed
and i'd change the quake scrolls to be "charge then charged pound" or vice versa

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 08:26

though i have NO idea how the spin attacks or quake sounds (both charging and charged use) would interfere with the sounds that the swords and hammers themselves are set to
you could have a LTM-like additive setup but that's a lot of work and can we just use that on the rewrite please

My idea was to just add more slots for sound effects on the action tab for the multiple sound effects.

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 15:57

Sword: Slash Sound, Beam Sound
Peril Beam: Beam Sound
Cross Beams: Beam Sound
Din's Fire: Rise Sound, Fall Sound, Flame Sound
Nayru's Love: Fly Out Sound, Fly In Sound, Shield Sound
Lens: On Sound, Off Sound
Quake Hammer: Pound Sound, Charge Sound
Super Quake: Pound Sound, Charge Sound
Spin Attack: Spinning Sound, Charge Sound
Hurricane Spin: Spinning Sound, Charge Sound

so like 3-4 sfx slots in the action tab of the item editor

admittedly my idea does save quest file size since it only has one user-set value for each
