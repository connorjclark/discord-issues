If you set a counter cost for a lift glove item, it validates and applies the cost when you lift something. However, it also validates the cost when throwing, even though it does not apply said cost.

Either it should be applying the cost at both oppertunities, or it shouldn't validate the cost the second time.

yep, so uh
I had code specifically making sure this didn't validate the cost
....except, for the glove being *passively on a button*, it needs to have the cost to return the item ID....
so, had to cache the ID you last lifted with, and allow that to be used instead
(fixed)
