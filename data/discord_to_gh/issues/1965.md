I posted a feature request suggesting a QR that mimicks Willow-style dmap palette change that doesn't fade to black.

Do you have any script using `Screen->Lit`, such as the Classic.zh Z2 lantern script? @ mitchfork

=== @ mitchfork 10/15/2022 17:26

Can check when I'm at my computer, but almost certain I'm not

=== @ mitchfork 10/16/2022 02:58

Can confirm 0 usage of `Screen->Lit`, @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)

....fuck, this is my fault
should be fixed next build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2022 18:42

was this fixed?

=== @ mitchfork 10/24/2022 21:07

Looks like it's fixed in a111 @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)
Thanks!
