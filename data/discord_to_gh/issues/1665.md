What it says on the tin. I think this was something planned that was never made. You can of course just script triggers, but since the LW_SCRIPT weapon pointers are now used kinda dynamically for custom stuff, this being in-engine and functional as expected would be nice.

You can make individual combos trigger screen secrets with these weapon types now, but it kind creates this weird separate environment where the trigger is on the combo, not the flag.

yeah, this probably should be implemented

the main thing that makes this annoying is that it needs more secret combos too
which needs more gui work

....which, means the entire secret combos gui needs to be upgraded.......
