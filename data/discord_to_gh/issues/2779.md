..and this is in the nightly-2023-10-22-2 build that I just downloaded

map or dmap?
you said dmap in the other channel but map here
(not that I'm sure what the `map editor` would be, aside from like, either screen data, or the normal combo placement screen)

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/22/2023 20:40

I mean the DMAP editor
(meta) thread name was changed: [DMap Editor] Zquest now crashes when I attempt to change anything in the Dmap editor

Strange, not seeing a crash report in sentry.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/22/2023 20:52

Oof, it did just crash to desktop for me.  Specifically, when I tried to drag that slider under the left box to the left.  I'll keep experimenting.

And that's in a new quest file, too.

Got a report that time, I'll fix this.

more crashyness in dialogs
hopefully all one fix

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/22/2023 21:30
