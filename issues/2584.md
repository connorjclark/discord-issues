This would function like Quick Assign but would add any unused scripts to the earliest available empty slot, without having to open the assign dialog.

maybe there could be a dropdown for assign type:quick,smart,manual. IDK

Do note that it wouldnt affect globals and hero scripts, as there is care needed to assign those manually. Just LWeapon,Eweapon,FFC,NPC,Itemdata, Itemsprite,screendata,and combodata

alternately, this could be a "Quick Assign Options Dialog" where you can set up Smart Assigns manually.

I've thought about smart assign before
though I figure globals can assign if the name matches the slot name, and the slot was already empty
