err
you're comparing a bugged nightly to the current nightly?
Do you have the `Old String Margins` QR on?
or off?
If on, then you absolutely should not be comparing the 9/6 nightly to current, as it was bugged in the 9/6 nightly.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/11/2022 10:58

I'll double check when I get home from the doctor's

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2022 23:29

so yeah, that's on you
test 2.53 vs the lastest nightly
not a bugged nightly vs the latest nightly
the 9/6 nightly was bugged
so it looking 'right' in the 9/6 nightly with that qr on
means nothing

=== @ NightmareJames 10/11/2022 23:30

This quest was started in 106 something

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2022 23:30

well you're using the 2.53 compat string rule

=== @ NightmareJames 10/11/2022 23:30

I can't put it in 2.53

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2022 23:30

the point of that rule
is to make the strings
look like they did in 2.53

=== @ NightmareJames 10/11/2022 23:30

Ah, OK

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2022 23:30

so with that rule on, if they look different to 2.53, that's an issue
this isn't a bug, but a bug FIX

=== @ NightmareJames 10/11/2022 23:30

I hate fixing 150 strings, but thank you for your time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2022 23:31

use the compat rule dialog thing
which by deafult pops up every time you load a quest
and you can get to from
`Quest->Options->Rule Templates->Bugfix`
this issue stems from you using a bunch of old compat rules for a new quest
which, is technically a user error on your part.
Sadly, you built things in a version that WAS bugged, and fixing the bug broke how you had it
