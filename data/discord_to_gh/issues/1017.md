In the enemy editor, there's a field for "Touch Effects" on the Walking Enemy type. Options include "Drain Rupees" (although a negative number will actually increase the rupees), as well as "Drain Life" and "Drain Magic". Can this be easily expanded to do things like Drain/Increase CR_SCRIPT1, etc?

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:13

Might warrant a separate request, but, it would also be neat if there was a "stun Link" option which just prevented Link movement (like NoAction()) for a certain amount of time, but ideally in a way where Link won't get stunned before he can move again. However, something like that could also be left to scripting.

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:15

Neither of these are high priority, but if it's easy to add it'd be neat.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 02:20

`Link->Defense[]` has a stun option
although I think that's only partially implemented (i.e. script only) at the moment? ( @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) any info on that? )
more touch drain options would make total sense

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/15/2021 02:30

Link->Defense is implemented in the UI
jman did that
It's under Quest->Player

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 02:33

Ah nice
That's the answer for the stun part, @ Mitsukara

=== @ Mitsukara 09/15/2021 02:35

Cool
Pushing my luck on this general subject... does it sound complicated to make these touch effects be applicable to weapons?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 02:37

Weapons should frankly be easy... but enemy/item attributes to set the weapons is a chunk more work.
(Neither out of the question; though I'd make a separate thread for that)

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 03:26

Couldn't one just have two checkboxes for the drain effect to apply to enemy touch, enemy weapon, both, or none?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 03:29

Firstly, that still needs adding vars. Checkboxes or dropdowns, still adding stuff. 
Secondly, then the next feature request that comes in is "hey I want to be able to have the touch drain X and the weapon drain Y"

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 03:35

I don't particularly care if it can just be scripted anyways (similar to curse effects on non-walking enemies and eweapons)

=== @ Alucard648 09/15/2021 17:59

What about  also add siilar expansion to eating enemies - Eat(Ccounter XX)?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/15/2021 18:27

hmm can script reads of link's eaten status read WHICH enemy id he is being eaten by?

=== @ Alucard648 09/15/2021 22:12

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "hmm can script reads of link'…"): ```//Returns pointer to NPC that has eaten hero. Otherwise returns invalid pointer.
npc EatenBy(){
    if (Hero->Eaten) return;
    for (int i=1; i< Screen->NumNPCs();i++){
        npc n = Screen->LoadNPC(i);
        if ((n->X == Hero->X)&&(n->Y == Hero->Y)) return n;
    }
    return;
}```

As of 2.55 latest alpha.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 22:15

is there not a `HasLink` or somesuch readable on enemies?
(There *is* internally, so, would not be difficult to add if it's missing)

=== @ Alucard648 09/15/2021 22:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "is there not a `HasLink` or s…"): No such thing, as of latest alpha.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 22:23

1. Add more counters to touch effect drain
2. Add `bool npc->HasLink;`, read-only, to zscript
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
(your method might fail if multiple enemies are at the exact same x/y, this new addition would prevent that)
