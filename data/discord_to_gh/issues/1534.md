- In alpha 106, pressing the Delete key in the palette editor no longer deletes the selected c-set.
- Pressing 'T' in the combo editor no longer opens the Tile page.
- You can also no longer hold Shift + Arrow Up/ Down to select multiple c-sets in the palette editor.

(I'm not sure if these are bugs tbh, but they seem like handy features that may have been removed at some point. They are in alpha 96, but I have not used any alphas between 96 and 106)
