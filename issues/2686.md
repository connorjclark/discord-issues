Have a dimmed layer view like in RPG maker.
Like if layer 2 is being selected on the editor. All other layers become translucent.

That's a pretty interesting idea, honestly.  I can see it being very, very useful.  Though it may also be nice to have a [Shift]+[Hotkey] sort of thing to toggle it in real time.

May or may not be doable considering how the combo draws use palettes

Even a dithering effect might be nice.
