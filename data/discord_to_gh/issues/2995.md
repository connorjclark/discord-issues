This Hero->Action state is not being set, even when you get hurt in water. As far as I can tell this isn't causing any actual non-script bugs, just that any old scripts that relied on this don't detect it anymore

this test quest traces Hero->Action. You can see that it never becomes `LA_GOTHURTWATER` even when it should
oh, should specify - 2.55, Jan 8 nightly

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I know water is my thing but I'm doing slopes right now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 05:06

im sleep cycle dying, and then working tomorrow, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

=== @ mitchfork 01/19/2024 05:10

actually did you ever get knocked back by hits in water?
if so then that is no longer happening. But I don't know if that was real

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 05:11

test 2.50.2 please

=== @ mitchfork 01/19/2024 05:13

don't have that version but there's no knockback in 2.53
so that's probabably okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 05:14

and the action was being set in 2.53?
(brain is just going "is this an OLD bug somehow?")

=== @ mitchfork 01/19/2024 05:18

yes, being set correctly

=== @ mitchfork 01/19/2024 05:19

I know it was working in older 2.55 but I cleaned all my versions up and deleted a bunch. but at least around a92 (pretty ancient still) this was definitely working, since I relied on it for my own knockback scripts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 05:19

k, well, that's all the brainpower I have to contribute for the time being

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/27/2024 01:27

A108 broken too

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2024 02:58

A98 works. here is a qst file made in earlier A92.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) any idea on this one? above is what I bisected to

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 18:56

our friend "break on change" (for action) wins the day again

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 18:58

its getting set to `swimhit`, but then in `checkspecial2` gets reset to `swimming`


```
else if (!isSwimming())
{
    SetSwim();
```

b/c `isSwimming()` does not consider `swimhit`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2024 19:47

oh shit
good catch
sorry just woke up

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 22:18

fixed in fork
