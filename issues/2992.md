Latest build, Jan 17th (17:08:15 UTC cuz there was two builds today)

View -> Map

Press Z

Poof!

Although there's probably crash reports coming in about it, but still

yep, that's the screenshot button
guessing wasn't handled properly for the a5 upgrade of the map viewer

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 00:29

...oh, or is it not screenshot in that window?
Z is randomly screenshot in a lot of windows
but looks like it might be "jump to center" or something here?

jump to origin/top-left corner it looks like
but that's it, it does not change zoom level

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 00:32

easy fix

(replying to @ Majora "Latest build, Jan 17th (17:08…"): also btw, see the `prerelease.27`?

that uniquely identifies the build
(both as being 3.0, and being that specific build)

=== @ Majora 01/18/2024 00:53

d'oh, noted!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 00:53

if you note, the 3.0 build before was `prerelease.26`. It is literally just a counter lol.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 00:54

wonder what its counting up to

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 00:54

and yeah lol, as for crash reports

access violation read of `0x0`, i.e. nullpointer deref
at least that one is a clear report lol
also lol, all the menus!
