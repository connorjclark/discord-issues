Have a way to copy a color from one C-set to another C-set. Right click menu in the main palette editor preferably, I thought this was already a thing but I guess not. Ideally you'd be able to also copy colors from c-sets between palettes.

(replying to @ Anthus "Have a way to copy a color fr…"): Ctrl-click-and-drag?

Oh, huh I didn't know that was the way. Will try when I'm at my PC again, thanks.
