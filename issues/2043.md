Open 1st or New Quest, press F6.  It will automatically continue without a choice.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/22/2022 12:20

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) ? (I can't see this being anything my or deedee's recent changes would have caused)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/22/2022 17:45

Having trouble repro'ing this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/22/2022 17:46

So when you accept the allegro dialog prompt ("End current game?"), it shows the end game screen then immediately chooses continue?
Does it matter if you pressed "Yes" in the dialog with mouse vs w/ Enter?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/22/2022 22:05

Seems to happen if you press Enter from the menu.  If I F6 it or use the mouse anywhere to select it, it doesn't double-press

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/22/2022 22:07

Is the enter key bound to anything in your button mappings?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/22/2022 22:08

Start
But I never had the issue before

=== @ NightmareJames 11/23/2022 16:49

Yeah, have the same issue in the 11-23 nightly

=== @ NightmareJames 11/26/2022 23:58

It still exists in the 11-26 Nightly, and is extremely annoying.  I don't know why it's reading after you press "Enter" on the menu

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/27/2022 00:03

I'm looking at it right now.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/27/2022 00:33

Fixed for next nightly, building now.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/27/2022 00:35

Appreciate it

=== @ NightmareJames 11/27/2022 22:20

Still happening.  üôÅ
Latest nightly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/27/2022 23:26

so it happens even for the shortest tap? only only when holding it down for a bit?
what is your key repeat setting? https://winaero.com/change-keyboard-repeat-delay-and-rate-in-windows-10/

I believe it's the default
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/28/2022 00:23

Fast repeat rate is default?
Not a fix for real but try turning that down, problem go away?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 00:24

No it did not
Let me bump it down one more notch
Yes, it's still automatic
I'm home, let me video it real fast

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 00:32

Great, why isn't Discord allowing me to post links here?
üò¶  Emily?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 00:34

:: sigh ::

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/28/2022 00:35

I have trouble on web version
Works for desktop discord.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 00:35

Connor, I'm going to DM you the video then
Wow, can't do it freaking there either

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/28/2022 00:37

I don't need a video, I reproduced it myself
Don't get why still a problem

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 00:37

Where do I report the Discord issue formally?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/28/2022 00:37

Google it
Are you in a v6 replay by chance?
Fix is only for v7 (or when not recording)

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 00:39

I haven't made anything past 11-17 (though I have upgraded Demo SP)

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 00:44

https://youtu.be/0cc856pNJBA  (testing)
OK, fixed the entering problem on my end.  This is the video I made for you Connor, know you reproduced it

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 18:23

This is fixed.  Thank you very much

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/28/2022 18:26

huh?? how?
what changed
you're sure?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 18:27

I just tested it.  I'll recheck it when I get home later, but I didn't have the issue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/28/2022 18:27

can you test in just classic 1st quest real quick?
I did notice it only happened in some quests

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 18:28

I'll test it in all of them

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 18:29

Weird
Did not happen in the 5-heart save, but sure happened in the 9-heart save
For Demo SP
Did not happen in Classic 1st (new save)
Did not happen in New 2022 (new save)
Did not happen in New 2013 (new save)
Did not happen in Demo SP (new save)
Did not happen in Sidestory (new save)
I'm just going to include my Demo SP 253 save and let you look at it
As it only happened in one spot

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/28/2022 18:37

Is there anything particular with f6 menu stuff  in that quest? There's a QR i believe related to this menu

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/28/2022 18:38

`Old (Instant) F6 Menu`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/28/2022 18:39

^that, James maybe it's consistent with the absence/presence of that QR

=== @ NightmareJames 11/28/2022 18:40

Talk about it later after I start introducing my friend to ZC
RN need a half hour nap then need to get back to work, was just doing spot checks while my phone charged

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 03:34

Any update @ DeletedUser ?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/30/2022 03:37

I'll be doing more tomorrow, sick and have to take Dad to the hospital tomorrow
(diabetic sick)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 04:32

Still can't reproduce anymore on my end.
qr_OLD_F6 didn't make a difference

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/30/2022 04:32

I tried the same
also couldn't reproduce

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 04:33

I also tried maxing my key repeat settings
at most, it happens if I hold for nearly a second

=== @ NightmareJames 11/30/2022 13:59

Old F6:

Demo SP has it
Sidestory has it
New 2022 (A111) has it
New 2022 (A109) has it
New 2013 has it
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2022 19:26

James, could you go through the release archives and determine the _first_ release that shows this bug?

I still can't repro (after being able to but then _fixing_ it, at least for myself...)

=== @ NightmareJames 12/04/2022 20:19

OK, but I'm not at a computer right now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 06:49

....wait a minute
this might be the same issue as #2060 ?
....which I just fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 06:56

@ DeletedUser try this?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1044587580647280660/1049217727392391168/zelda.exe?ex=65e570a7&is=65d2fba7&hm=514f5239b9fc5de8b803d03861f0bf71dc5449ba997a12f7fa59fe636c745c61&

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 07:02

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1048494782617505812/1049219087856844851/image.png
Yeah, so,
on opening that menu
it eats the existing start input via `rSbtn()`
....which was exactly the bug Deathrider ran into with the Map button auto-pressing for `rPbtn()`
this is almost certainly fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 08:40

...build breaks replays though, so only test the one bug with it, don't record anything in it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/06/2022 09:21

FYI, this is the test build to try now: https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-12-06-2

=== @ NightmareJames 12/06/2022 20:11

I can only isolate it in the one save file position now (the ORIGINAL Demo SP save file position).  I wouldn't worry about it too much.  If it happens again I'll reopen the bug report

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/06/2022 20:15

And you tried in the build I posted?

=== @ NightmareJames 12/06/2022 20:18

Yes
I think the actual save slot got corrupted crazy enough, not sure
In the particular save file

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/06/2022 20:42

nothing in the save file would impact input handling
But - is there a recording associated with that save file?
If so, what version is it?
The fix is _only for version 8+_ replays
(or for no recording)

=== @ NightmareJames 12/06/2022 20:48

Version 6 or 7 (whatever the 11-30 nightly was)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 20:50

so, yeah, that won't be fixed for that save file
make a new save file

=== @ NightmareJames 12/06/2022 21:00

I think that's the correct call
I'll make a new one tonight and re-test

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/06/2022 23:34

Try playing back a new version 8 recording too
On a quest you know works

=== @ NightmareJames 12/07/2022 00:44

This bug is gone, which version starts V8?
It just got locked into that one slot unfortunately

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/07/2022 01:38

Only the test build I referenced abouve.
I want more testing of https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1048494782617505812 before I merge..

=== @ NightmareJames 12/07/2022 07:30

OK

=== @ NightmareJames 12/07/2022 20:37

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) , do you want me to upgrade previous replays, or do you want me to just make a new one?
Feeling much better today BTW

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/07/2022 20:38

Hold off on replays until the input issues merges
But can you try a new recording  on that one?

=== @ NightmareJames 12/07/2022 20:39

You want a new recording on Demo SP?  How far do you want me to go in?
Level J?  Lord Wizzrobe?  Level 1?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/07/2022 20:41

Just a level. Save and restart from the save file few times

=== @ NightmareJames 12/07/2022 21:06

Sorry man
I have NO CLUE what this is

=== @ NightmareJames 12/07/2022 21:09

(brand new replay BTW)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/07/2022 21:23

what about just _replay_ (no assert)?
does it mess up?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/07/2022 21:46

(yes, it does)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/07/2022 21:58

OK, I believe I've fixed this issue. Building new test build now.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/07/2022 22:17

https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-12-07

=== @ NightmareJames 12/08/2022 03:33

Seems all fixed now.  No more asserts for now
Going to play back the old replays now
