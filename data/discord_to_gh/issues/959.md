A combo flag which prevents Roc Items from initiating a jump if Link is standing on the flag.
(meta) thread name was changed: No Link Jump flag

....that sounds STUPIDLY simple. Question: How sensitive do you think it should be?

Hmm. I think a good range is about 4 pixels onto the flag, but some people might want more, or less, hard to say without fiddling with it

4 pixels is the standard for standing on a platform in sideview, so makes sense
and I think it's also the amount for the little side-push thing
