With the addition of functioning bomb flowers with liftable combos, I was wondering if it would be possible to add some sort of effect in the combo editor that causes the combo to instantly explode or spawn a specified bomb-type weapon in its place. The combo that it gets replaced with would be either the lift under combo or specified in a similar way.

Something like this would bring the behavior of bomb flowers closer to that in mainline Zelda games and could even allow for chained bomb flower explosions for puzzles.

You can accomplish this using `Step->Effects`, as I did in the new default quest (you know, the one that was bugged in the latest nightly... should have that fixed soon)
a `Step->Effects` combo can be set to spawn a weapon on command, which can be triggered using the `ComboType Effects->` trigger flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 15:29

You can look at this quest

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 15:30

Okay, that makes sense I think. Let me quickly test it on my quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 15:31

The main problem this has, is it doesn't emulate a specific bomb item- in this case, importantly, it will not respect the FUSE of a specific bomb item.

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 15:43

Seems to mostly work. Strangely, the only weapon types it's responding to are fire based.
Even though I specified it to be triggered by arrows, swords, sword beams, etc

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 15:45

? What's your setup exactly?
Specifically the `Weapons` and `Effects` tabs

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 15:48

Identical to the one in the sample quest, just with more weapons that can trigger it

The min level was initially set to 0 and was still behaving the same way, as expected
I just wanted to see if setting it to 1 would somehow fix it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 15:50

Can you paste the report info from Etc->About?

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 15:50

Can do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 15:53

are you, by chance, putting the combos on layers?

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 15:53

Yes, however it's still doing it if I place it on layer 0

You have several important layer-related QRs disabled

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 15:56

Enabled them and still nothing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 15:56

...that's odd.

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 15:57

As a side note, triggered screen secrets stay triggered on reset without saving if you start on the same screen
Totally benign bug but I just noticed that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 15:58

they don't for me

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 15:59

Anyway I have no idea what's happening here with the bomb flower
Wait now it's working without me changing anything
I am getting gaslit by ZC again

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:03

Strangely now the explosions don't trigger other bomb flowers
So you still can't chain the explosions
My guess is that it's not counting the spawned bomb flowers as a player or enemy weapon

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:04

no, that uh, isn't possible
(If it wasn't a player OR enemy weapon, it wouldn't be anything, it wouldn't exist at all)

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:04

If the player picks up a bomb and throws it, it triggers adjacent bomb flowers upon exploding, but if the player just slashes a bomb flower, it does not trigger adjacent explosions

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:05

what are the settings on the Step->Effects combo?

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:05

Settings under which tab

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:05

attributes

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:05

0
6
0
101
obviously the 4th row isn't relevant since that's just the sprite used, but I included it for completeness

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:06

do you have `min level` set to `0` or `1`?

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:07

1. Apparently these bomb flowers are counted as level 0 I guess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:07

yeah, they have no item to get a level attribute from
....nothing should ever count as level 0 though, so that's a minor bug

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:08

also you can't lift them
and they don't trigger secret combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:10

??
Not being able to lift the bomb makes sense because it doesn't have the settings from the parent item
but it should always trigger secret combos....

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:12

Demonstrating it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:13

. . . it triggers secret combos fine for me
is that actually a secret combo, or is that a dungeon bombable door?

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:13

First I demonstrate the chain explosion working but not triggering the wall, then I demonstrate the player throwing a bomb flower successfully triggering the wall, then I attempt to lift a lit bomb that's been triggered by another bomb, then I show I can lift a bomb that's been picked up already by the player
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "is that actually a secret com‚Ä¶"): It's an actual secret combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:14

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è secret combos trigger fine for me
....oh
wait, I see, haha
it's, uh
it's not close enough

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:15

Wait am I stupid
I think I am stupid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:15

a bomb that spawns centered on a combo can only trigger bomb flags on THAT combo, it does not reach the combo next to it
when lifted/thrown, it's no longer centered, so it's closer to the wall

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:16

Yeah makes sense
I suppose the only point of this thread now is to request an attribute to specify a fuse time when attacked instead of lifted

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:17

Super Bombs, on the other hand, can reach
(replying to @ Phosphor "I suppose the only point of t‚Ä¶"): you'd specify the item
to inherit from
same way the lifting works
(already have it coded)

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:19

I might just already be forgetting where it is since it's new to me, but where do you specify it? I'm assuming it's different from the specified lift weapon

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:22

You don't yet
until I post the update

=== @ Phosphor 05/31/2023 16:28

Ahh okay then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 16:29

(It will be just below the sprite)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 18:12

@ Phosphor new nightly is on the way now, should be ~30min
