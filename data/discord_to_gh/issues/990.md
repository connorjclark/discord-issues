~~-Name insertion (reserved)~~ complete
~~-insert tile~~ complete
-Change portrait data (reserved)
-Yes/No DLG (reserved)
-Wait for "A"
-Screen secrets

=== @ P-Tux7 09/05/2021 06:18

why would a string need to change portrait data?
i thought it was like, have each new string set a new portrait

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/05/2021 06:26

like, facial reactions as they speak maybe?
(Zoria reserved the SCC for it without implementing it, so I'm just gonna add it)

`\28\26308\6\16\16\0` -> `Draw tile 26308, cset 6, taking up a 16x16 area, flip 0`

since the `width` is `32`, i.e. `>16 && <= 32`, the tile-width is 2. Works for height as well, for block draws.

@ Mitsukara if you want to play with these....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/05/2021 12:50

(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ Alucard648 09/05/2021 17:30

What about SCC that triggers screen secrets, when used in message? For instance, quest reward, Freeform Triforce count entrance etc.

=== @ Mitsukara 09/05/2021 18:07

oh,, super cool! (Although I'm still on Linux so I'm not sure I can run these builds)
(maybe in a windows 10 virtual machine...)

=== @ P-Tux7 09/05/2021 19:45

Can SCCs award per-level items?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/05/2021 21:54

can strings play sounds?
for custom learn slash/half magic rooms where you use a scc to give an item and play a sound at the end of the string

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/05/2021 22:41

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): ^This is everything SCCs have presently, @ P-Tux7
so, sounds yes
levelitems.... no

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/05/2021 22:43

Let's add a "Spawn Item On Player" SCC. Right now there's `Give Item`, but that doesn't run things like pickup scripts, or cause you to "hold up" the item. I could probably write one that forces those things to happen, which could then be used to trigger an item pickup script, or give a map/compasss/triforce

=== @ P-Tux7 09/05/2021 22:45

ah good
sorry i haven't gotten on my computer lately

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/05/2021 22:51

ah

=== @ Mitsukara 09/05/2021 23:10

Sounds have been a thing in SCCs since 2.50
also
in 2.50.2 if you type \16\bosskeyitemnumberhere,  you will actually get the boss key for the current dmap you're on, as though you picked it up
but _removing_ it, with \17\, wouldn't work AFAIK
so that probably still works unless it got changed? But yeah I like the spawn item on player concept
