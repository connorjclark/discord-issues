No clue whether this is a feature request or bug report; currently, enemies are delayed by 1 frame before their script starts running. This means if you, say, have a script reposition an enemy on frame 1 of the script; for 1 frame the enemy will still be at the old position.

Related, but would it be possible to have a ->Spawning() or ->isSpawning() command for enemies? I know there's MovePaused, but something for whether the enemy is in their spawn poof specifically would be nice.
(I guess the answer to the second question is "yes" given that I could probably add that)
(no clue where to start for the first though)

Hi Deedee, are you saying MovePaused also returns true when the enemy is spawning? Right now I was handling with counters always 😂

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/11/2023 18:16

yeah, it does
according to the documentation anyways

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "No clue whether this is a fea…"): Doesn't sound too bad, *you could certainly add it*. (The `isSpawning()`, I mean)

As for the 1 frame, that could be a timing issue of any sort.... bleh
