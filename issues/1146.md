If I place a chest combo on a layer, it won't open if the combo underneath it doesn't have the effect square set. Dunno if this is intended or not but it seems to me like the chest should be referencing its own effect square to determine which parts are the chest. Especially when I might happen to be making new floor types in an older tileset resulting in combos without the square checked

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 00:28

```in an older tileset```
shouldn't zq import effect squares correctly? a water combo should have all four quadrants checked automatically

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:34

Could be with how ZQuest does or did interpret old files
I know I started the quest after effect squares were added, but all my unused combos have the effect square as blank.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 00:35

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) are unused combos meant to have full or empty effect squares

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/31/2021 00:35

full

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 00:35

uhh
something ain't importing right

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/31/2021 00:35

damnit

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:35

But the quest was saved before that was fixed IIRC

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/31/2021 00:35

ah, yeah, makes sense

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:36

or perhaps not? Try and see on a fresh tileset if it sets it for unused combos

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 00:36

ok so do me a favour, import DOR's original quest now and see what happens to the unused combos

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:37

Yup, as of this version it updates the effect squares properly on older quests
So it's just that my quest was saved in 2.55 prior that it doesn't have that

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 00:37

ok good
no issue

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 00:38

Still, the original issue. Are effect squares intended to only work on layer 0?
Or to be inherited from 0 on higher layers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2021 03:09

It should be checking on the layer
Guessing that's a bug with the new chest code
Check signs too, they probably have the same issue

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/31/2021 14:20

(meta) thread name was changed: Chests on layers reference effect square on layer below
chests on layer 2 check layer 1, layer 1 checks layer 0

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2021 14:43

Is that for serious what it's doing? ü§¶

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/31/2021 14:43

yeah, but I'm not sure why
unless the code's just been horribly broken this whole time

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/01/2021 00:40

yeah the code's just been broken for layered effect squares
layers 1 and 2 always checked the layer below

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/07/2021 14:11

So, first...are Layer 1 and 2 chests rule based?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/07/2021 14:13

You might start to see why I did not rush into layer 1/2 chests and blocks. I may have not elaborated my reasons, as the I am tired of doing that, but I put stuff like that on hold for 2.60 b Ed cause it just adds to beta phase 2.55 fixes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/07/2021 15:33

yes of fucking course they are
everything that could break old stuff is rule based
we aren't stupid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/07/2021 17:15

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) have you fixed this yet?
(asking because I'll handle it now if you haven't)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/07/2021 17:15

I believe I fixed this, yeah
had to remember but I remember making a test quest to test out the fix

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/07/2021 17:17

ah yeah, I see the commit
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíChests on layers reference effect square on layer below
