I spoke with Moosh earlier about this, but the idea is basically to allow an option in the editor to enable certain maps as "layer maps" in the editor. This would make it so that if a map was counted as a "layer map" then you would scroll past it when scrolling through your maps (as it doesn't make much sense to go to specific screens for layers when 99.9% of the time you can do whatever you need to do through the layer buttons). Ideally, when you enabled an entire map to automatically be a layer, that would also automatically set the map to be a "layer map". Presumably this would be stored in a config file outside the quest rather than within the quest itself (doing so would take up quest file space, and I don't see any reason to need to access this info readily from within ZScript or somesuch).

I think I suggested something similar before but @ Moosh seemed to believe it would be possible somehow, someway.

Colin mentions layers: https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=78330&p=1074730
And me talking about Colin's suggestion from an internal channel:
> we could abstract a lot of it away in the editor. for example, we have zquest editor "reserve" a number of map indices upfront, hiding those from the normal Map selector and when a screen need a layer just grab the next one from our "set aside" maps. dont make people set up auto map or anything like that. Then if they wanted to go edit that layer screen directly for some reason ... or assign a specific screen to a layer ... they still could set it manually if they want

> i think it basically boils down to "why make me set up auto layering at all, not very automatic"

> should just always let you click to enable / get a screen assigned to that layer

I'd like to know how common it is to re-use a screen across multiple others as a layer. I'm guessing the UI needs some affordance that screens/layers aren't 1:1, right?

=== @ Russ 10/07/2023 15:20

I frequently will use a weather layer screen across several screens
I also frequently don't use 1:1 layer maps
If I have an area that uses layer 1 on every screen, and layer 2 on some but not all screens, I'll typically have layer 1 on another map that matches up to it, and then layer 2 will be on the layer 1 map in unused screens that kind fill in the gaps of the map
For that reason, I tend not to use autolayer

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/08/2023 00:41

More people would use autolayers if these things were implemented because they would make designing more seamless

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/08/2023 00:44

Personally I always use autolayers if I can, it's just annoying

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 00:47

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I'd like to know how common i…"): weather screens to be a layer for an entire area overlaying a rain/snow/sandstorm/etc effect are the main use case I can think of
so
the big thing is
if we do this and have it use not real maps/screens
.....scripts need to somehow be able to manage stuff still
....which, I mean, the temp screen pointers help when you're modifying the CURRENT screen
but, how does a script modify the layer of a remote screen? Well
it loads the mapdata for the base screen... and then checks it's `->LayerMap[lyr]`, `->LayerScreen[lyr]`
so, those values would need to work for the "fake" screens, or would need some form of replacement

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2023 00:54

I wasn't suggesting the engine would have a notion of fake maps/screens, just that the editor would handle it mostly by itself (but, with a way to opt out and set a layer to a specific screen, if "just any new one somewhere in a reserved map" won't do like for weather). Hide those "reserved maps" (just hidden from the normal editor Map selector...), but still let user "jump to layer screen" when looking at a specific screen's layer.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 00:55

yeah, those maps would need to still work for scripts, is the main point

=== @ Russ 10/08/2023 01:34

So we’d still have the same map count, layer maps would just be invisible but count to it
In that case, I’d still be unlikely to use auto layer extensively because bumping into the max map count is the thing I fear

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 12/29/2023 09:56

I just wanted to add some more stuff I thought about that would improve this feature:
- Since layer maps aren't supposed to be accessed directly, this means a large chunk of the data does not need to be saved (e.g. items on screen, enemies, screen flags, things of that nature). Some things will need saved like flags. This could cut down on file size a lot for quests that utilize lots of layers (relative to how much space they'd take up currently).
- It may also be helpful to add a button in the layer menu that allows you to automatically pick a blank map not already used for anything, and automatically convert it into a layer map.

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 12/29/2023 10:20

Alternatively, we could just switch to having... real layers. The biggest issues I see with that are:
- not an obvious way to make them backwards compatible so they'd need to be a new thing
- screen flags, secrets on layers, and combo functionality on layers would need rewritten in a way to accommodate new layers.
- in line with the first point, scripting functions that reference layers would need new functions added to accommodate the new layers, or somehow make it so they are compatible with new ones. This might not be too bad if, say, screens could only use "real" layers and not the current layer system or vice versa, eliminating ambiguity.
- Quest file format would presumably need changed a bit to accommodate storing this info.

The benefits to this:
- Shaves off a lot from quest size
- Would not need to affect the actual map count, therefore more layers could be used per quest.
- A bunch more layers could be added per screen without significant performance/resource usage.
- Having real layers would be in-line with any modern program that uses layers (game engines, image editors...). Makes it easier to learn and easier to understand what's going on in each screen. Likewise, this would be less jank than marking some layers as "layer maps" and having to deal with the overhead of that.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/29/2023 10:35

I'm still convinced we can solve this with just improved UI in the editor - automating assigning layers in the editor (hiding the need to even know they are from a map) - and continuing to use maps as the storage and implementation.

> screen flags, secrets on layers, and combo functionality on layers would need rewritten in a way to accommodate new layers.

imo this is a non starter

> Since layer maps aren't supposed to be accessed directly, this means a large chunk of the data does not need to be saved 

Maps are already saved with a flag that skips writing what is still set to default values, so I think this is covered.

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 12/29/2023 12:16

```imo this is a non starter```
It would be annoying, but it would predominantly be using the same code just accessed from different control flow. I think it wouldn't be unreasonable if it was mutually exclusive if screens used the current layer system vs a new one, as that would allow most things to carry over across the two code-wise without needing to handle too many weird edge cases. Modernizations like this would make the editor much easier to use and a much more serious program.
