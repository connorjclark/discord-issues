Say I have combos on layer 2 and want to be able to move them to any other layer or even copy them to all other layers... feasible?

So the ability to move or copy

go to the layerscreen and copy it to the other layerscreen?

@ Deathrider - You do know that you can manipulate layers from the screen where they're acting as layers, right? It's literally a few clicks. Click on the tab for that layer, right click on the combo to bring up the menu and scroll to combo, right click on the combo to select combo

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "go to the layerscreen and cop…"): I wouldnt want to swap those layers for one screen since it would be inconsistent with all other screen

(replying to @ ywkls "@ Deathrider - You d…"): Yes, I have used combos before and that I can manipulate the layer screens, but what I am asking for would be a convenience if you have many various types of combos to change what layer they are on from the screen where they are present
this was just a passing thought for a convenience functionality. My current process is fine and if this wouldnt be considered necessary I can close this
