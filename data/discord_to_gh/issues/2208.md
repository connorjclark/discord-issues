This is separate from #2171 
In 1.90 quests, there is the inherent quality that you can use the Ladder over Water combos inside dungeon-type DMaps. This was not user-configurable. It's always supposed to happen. The screen flag "Toggle Allow Ladder" doesn't need to be on for the Ladder to be usable in dungeons in these versions.
As you can see in screen 2:44 of the attached quest, you're supposed to use the Ladder to cross the water, but you cannot.
I suppose the fix here is to always internally enable said screen flag when on a Dungeon-type DMap in quests in version 1.90 and below.

I ought to mention that the Ladder works perfectly fine in 1.92+ quests

so
the ladder is always allowed in dungeons, *currently*. Not togglable.

Though you must still:
1. Have a ladder item
2. Not be in the air (Z Axis)
3. Not be in the air (Sideview, with respect to sideview solidity)
....and not be `ilswim`? which is a weird swimming jank variable of some sort

BLAH
The water's Green Square is completely blank
so it isn't water

Yeah, that was..... a big compat bug.
Poor formatting sucks, it's all cleaned up now.

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2023 18:38

ah, ok, this probably fixes #2171 too, since the combo not being read as water would screw that up too. i'll check when the newest nightly is out
