Right now clock, if it used as active item, is even more OP than Divine Protection spell, as it also disables knockback from getting hit, unlike Divine Protection spell. And it is not possible to render player vulnerable to damaging stuff like in Castlevania when time is stopped. Hoping it is possible to do that. Feel free to close this topic as dupe.
Here is a link to ancient topic regarding this issue.

Here I had to rescript the clock functionality from scratch and it was still very buggy due to limited access to enemy data back in ZC 2.53 and earlier versions.
