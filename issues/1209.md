If you set a Rope-walking Walking Enemy to have a Shot Type of Rapid-Fire, it doesn't actually ever fire... despite that shot type not requiring halting. This QR would allow for that. I think this would make Death Knights a whole lot fairer since you would be able to "bait" them and hit them from the side. If this counts as a bug report then let me know and I'll recreate it there.

I'll look into it
Emily wants to get Alpha 100 out ASAP, and my computer is on it's last legs and I won't have another one for about 5 days

lock this - it actually does work in 2.55
i'll check 2.50.2 but i don't think theres a compatibility flag needed, it must have just always worked
