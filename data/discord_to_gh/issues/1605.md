Can we have a way to read a quest's header data within ZScript?

Like, title, author, version, minversion?

=== @ Orithan 05/11/2022 14:02

Yes
Though, what could we do with things like reading title, author and minversion?

As it stands the only real value I can see is reading the current version of the quest
So when you do a version change you can do stuff when loading a newer version of a quest.
Min Version seems redundant because its most relevant uses, ZC does for you.

Title and Author could be fun things to use in strings so you don't have to update any ZScript strings its used in later down the track if need be
These are generally speaking very niche applications and I would not complain if they weren't added
