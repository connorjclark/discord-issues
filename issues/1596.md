When Editing a tile, and having used the Hookshot tool to select a rectangle of pixels, is there a way to have the "Move" gauntlet button slide only those highlighted pixels rather than the entire tile?  

They could just leave a transparent pixel in their wake after being moved.

Or is there a way to do this now, and I'm just bumbleducking my way around in a way that's not finding it?

For example, the red box on the right is what I've selected with the hookshot. I want to move it one pixel to the left, all at once.  

Instead of the "Move" button moving only the selected rectangle, it currently slides the entire tile around.

this would also be insanely helpful for the tile editor

I
I hope you appreciate
what the fuck it is you've asked for here
This
Is NOT REMOTELY an easy task
And required a fair bit of rewriting how the tile editor works
to account for this
....but do note that I used the past tense `required` there, for, I do believe it has been completed.

So, one note:
-By default, it leaves the second selected color (the one placed with right-clicking) behind
-If you hold shift when you move it, it instead leaves behind color 0

I appreciate the notes.  To be fair on my part, any request I make is more of a "putting out of feelers" to see if it's even remotely feasible.  I really don't want anything to be too strenuous or time-consuming on the part of the devs.  Thank you anyway!

` I do believe it has been completed.`  When?  In the distant past?  Just recently?  I should probably know how to phrase any form of gratitude to match.
Those two bullet points are a great way to go about doing it in any case.  Absolutely well thought-out.  ^-^

```
Add floating selection to tile editor
    -A 'selected' area can now be moved
    -Moving the selected area causes it to "float" above the rest of the tile
    -While floating, it does not overwrite the pixels 'below' it
    -Upon changing the selection or saving, it 'falls', merging back into the tile.
    ( EmilyV, 11th May, 2022 )```
For a program that doesn't have any form of 'layers' to it's pixel editing, adding this was quite mindbending, and frankly I am completely surprised that I managed to finish it so quickly
