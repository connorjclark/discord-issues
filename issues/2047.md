To clarify I recalled that there is/was a QR that stop the midi music while the Hold up Item sound is playing then restarts it but I think it would be nice and nifty if it merely temporarily muted the midi and digital music channels while the hold up item sound is playing instead. I think that would be easy to do and it would probably be less jarring when it comes to midis and enhanced music that have built in loop points (such as .spc, .gsf, .nsf and .vgm files that Zelda Classic supports)
