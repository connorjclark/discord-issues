When an enemy is set to use TileWidth and TileHeight greater than 1, the drop location will always be based on the lowest rightmost tile, not the enemy's actual HitX/HitY location.

However: "Enemy Carries Item" *does* respect the enemy's actual hitbox and will follow the enemy and drop as expected.
It seems only the spawned-in item drops are affected by this bug.

weird...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 00:48

Okay, that's actually really weird
cause for me, the carried item is held at the topleft position
but the spawned item drop is at the center, where it's supposed to be
could you upload a test quest?

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "cause for me, the carried ite…"): Top left of the “tile” bounding box. It should be based on the enemy’s actual hitbox offsets, not its tiles. I have my enemy’s hitbox unchanged, meaning it’s in the top left of its tile box. But I adjusted its graphical offsets to center the visible sprite on the hitbox.
Ergo, carried items look correct because the hitbox and topleft of the tilebox agree, but dropped items try to center themselves based on the tile box, which is way past where I have the hitbox.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 21:24

@ Zaidyer okay, to clarify: you want dropped items to be in the center of their hitwidth and hitheight based off hitoffsets?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 21:26

I can make a Quest Rule for this behavior; I don't want to break older quests that might try and move the drops manually

=== @ Zaidyer 02/07/2022 21:53

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@ Zaidyer okay,…"): yes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 08:55

Okay, added two QR's, one in compat rules for fixing enemies carrying items, and one in enemy rules for making it so dropped items (and carried items if the former is checked) use the hitbox instead of the tile

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 08:58

I did some basic testing of them and didn't immediately notice an issue; they should be in the next build/nightly I post. I'll need you to point out if anything's weird.

The new rules appear to work as intended
👍
