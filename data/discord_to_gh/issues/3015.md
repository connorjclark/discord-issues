This is an intentional feature of replay mode
Apparently it can‚Äôt handle variable whistle pause times (I don‚Äôt pretend to understand why), so needs to have one standardized time for any replay
And so that time was chosen to be 0

Okay, so it does it even if you're *recording* a replay, right?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/25/2024 20:55

Yeah
Problem was sfx is not deterministic in terms of how many frames it takes to play
So initial replay implementation fixed it to some number of frames that matches the default sfx
Then DeeDee changed to zero because some quests disable the wait by playing a sfx in scripts
Fix is to estimate how long the engine sfx should take, and wait that many frames

fixed

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) you mentioned some quest (link to heavens maybe?) would set engine sfx to nothing and play sfx via script, meaning game does not pause

this should still support that, as it paused based on how long the engine sfx is now instead of a constant number of frames

I hope. I've assumed the "blank engine sfx" is really like, an sfx of no length....but if it is a blank audio file of some length.... then still gonna pause.

light of the heavens?

what?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/25/2024 23:54

not sure if it was link to the heavens (its whistle sfx is the default sfx), @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) lmk what quest it was so I can check

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2024 23:57

it would have to be a 2.5+ quest, LTTH was 2.10
quests before hand had no SFX data and use the default.qst SFX when played in modern ZC

perfect, that sfx is truly 0 length
