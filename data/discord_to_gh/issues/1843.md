Sometimes it's nice to just use MoveXY() just for the subpixel diagonal movement, but SPW_FLOATER is still restricted by some flags and combo types. (also the screen edge I think? I didn't check that one)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 12:32

A flag for `ignore collision` and a separate one for `ignore screen bounds`
shouldn't be that bad

=== @ Moosh 09/07/2022 12:32

You can combine them?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 12:33

?

=== @ Moosh 09/07/2022 12:33

The SPW_ constants

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 12:33

no, no, this isn't a special thing
bleh
fuck no

=== @ Moosh 09/07/2022 12:33

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 12:33

that's hardcoded old shit
it's literally *only* still used for flying

=== @ Moosh 09/07/2022 12:34

Okay that's what I thought

There's these, though
....this whole gui still needs a rework and info buttons added really badly

=== @ Moosh 09/07/2022 12:34

Surprised obeys solids wasn't there to begin with

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 12:35

Solids are handled with SPW_FLOATER

=== @ Moosh 09/07/2022 12:35

For editor access though I meant

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 12:35

most of these flags *only apply to script movement*

=== @ Moosh 09/07/2022 12:36

Oh right
I kiiinda forgot that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 12:36

The `can fall/walk over` for pitfalls affects engine movement
and the water ones might also? deedee did those, not sure

=== @ Moosh 09/07/2022 12:36

They do affect spawning though I believe?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 12:37

but the `can ONLY walk on...` only apply to script movement, IIRC
those were designed to work with the ghost-based functions

=== @ Moosh 09/07/2022 12:37

Whenever you do the GUI rework this tab could use a disclaimer

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 12:38

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....this whole gui still need…"): ^

=== @ Moosh 09/07/2022 12:38

yuuup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 12:39

I wonder how hard a flag to make engine movement use the script-based checks would be to add?
enemy code fucking sucks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 19:00

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 19:13

mostly works
except something decided to crash, probably with the screen edge one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 20:42

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅Moveflag to ignore all collision
and works, pushed

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2022 03:53

Small pedantic thing
It should be "Can Safely Move Over Pitfalls/Liquid" because most enemies it's set on by default... fly

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2022 03:56

And when you have classes like Walking Enemy and Flying Enemy that can confuse people into thinking only the movement that the former does counts as "walking" and it won't work on Keese et al. when it very much does and is practically required
