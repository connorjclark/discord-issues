I guess I'm mostly looking to see if this is even remotely possible.

There would be an area in the "Effects" tab for combos that would have a four (Or even 8) way cardinal directions-worth of combo input boxes.  Up, Up-right, right down-right, etc.   Whatever number is in them would tell the combo in that direction to change # combos forward or backward in the combo page when the combo is triggered by certain things, as per its instructions.

Toggling any checkbox would have it cause the combo in that direction to be triggered or toggled as if it had been the subject of a secret triggering, alongside the combo that just got triggered.

To get even fancier, there would be a number of checkboxes that would tell it what would and wouldn't trigger these effects.

This would be particularly  useful in cases like slashing tall grass, where the combo above it would continue to look 3D, rather than like only its upper half exists because its lower half was included in the combo you've just slashed.  Or, it'd be useful in 1x2 pillars that lower into the ground, assuming it can affect layers too.
