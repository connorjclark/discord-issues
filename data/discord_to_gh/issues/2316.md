I have an npc that carries and item and also has a death animation. The item appears at the npc's location the instant it dies as opposed to when the animation finishes
(meta) thread name was changed: Enemy Carries Item not respecting Immortal flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 07:31

....huh. Uh. I'll... need to see your script specifically, the engine "Enemy Carries Item" shit is absolutely janky as hell
also need to know the enemy's editor info, specifically enemy type and "Doesn't count as beatable enemy" checkbox

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 20:10

(replying to @ Deathrider ""): ....when are you setting `Immortal` to `true`?
I don't see that anywhere in the script

=== @ P-Tux7 04/16/2023 20:21

i could have sworn that enemies carrying items drop them instantly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 20:21

the point is the enemy shouldn't be dead until the scripted death animation ends, because it is `Immortal` for the duration

=== @ P-Tux7 04/16/2023 20:21

(i.e. the First Enemy Carries Item thing)
oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 20:22

except it appears the script never sets `Immortal = true`

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 20:38

@ Moosh it is in the PlayDeathAnim function right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:06

...so it appears to be, huh.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:10

So, let me go over everything to do with the item carrying:
-It drops when the enemy dies. Notably, an enemy dies if `(hp <= 0 && !immortal)`. Notice the immortal check there.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:13

-It drops when All Enemies Die. This would require that all beatable enemies on screen have been *removed from the array*, and thus are no longer being drawn or running their scripts. This would seem unlikely if the death animation is still drawing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:17

....as such, I have no idea what could cause this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:19

(replying to @ Deathrider ""): ...also I'm not really seeing the issue in your screenshots
also question, @ Deathrider, is this checked?

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 22:24

yes
the issue in the screenshots is that the item does not appear where the enemy died

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:25

...oh

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 22:26

I suppose I should have been clear that is the issue
moosh mentioned it was an issue with immortal being respected

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:27

I don't see what immortal has to do with this at all?
How is the enemy being spawned

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 22:27

poof
normal as far as I know

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:27

err, I meant like, placed on screen vs via script

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 22:28

not sure if this is what you mean

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:28

yep
and screenshot the flags for me?

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 22:29

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:35

Can you add
`printf("Has Item? %d\n", this->HasItem?1:0);`
to the npc script somewhere?
(and show me what it prints, obviously)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:39

(replying to @ Deathrider ""): Ah, I see!
`Enemies->Item` should NOT be checked, it overrides the `First Enemy Carries Item` flag.

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 22:41

doing that makes the item appear at the start of the death animation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:41

???

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:42

Like, the start of the SCRIPTED death animation?

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 22:42

yep

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:43

what the fuck
....set immortal to true at the top of your script, it must be being set too late

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 22:44

that worked
so this was not a bug then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:45

@ Moosh something you'll want to note in your script...
aye, a moosh issue

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 22:57

So what happened? Cuz the item still spawned before the enemy was fully dead

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:57

It spawns at the start of the death animation, apparently?
which occurs just BEFORE you are setting Immortal, it appears?
it's a timing issue on the npc script, I would assume. Solved by setting immortal sooner.

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 22:59

I see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:59


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096987706275397682/1097295312806215710/image.png?ex=65e500e5&is=65d28be5&hm=c8728aa226ca78c8fac9eba512dda9d2015b25c2900e66359a74131ece2eb02e&)
Yep, it marks itself dead just before running the script for the frame

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 23:00

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 23:00

if not for this one extra check, the enemy wouldn't even be revived by that:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096987706275397682/1097295478653202442/image.png?ex=65e5010c&is=65d28c0c&hm=66c887576cbc306e2569cc7f8d48ad1e4000745a03545619d765e2e034acf8c8&)
so basically, it is dying, it drops the item immediately, and then you are reviving it from the grave.

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 23:01

And yet when we tested it, enemies->item didn't have this same timing issue. Strange

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 23:01

because `Enemies->Item` requires every beatable enemy onscreen to be dead

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 23:01

Either way a fix is a fix but this timing is a weird engine quirk to me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 23:01

and is a global screen check, not part of each enemy's death
so, `Enemies->Item` is after all death animations

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 23:02

gotcha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 23:02

`Enemy Carries Item` is start of death animation
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è why it's that way IDK, it just is

=== @ P-Tux7 04/16/2023 23:21

zelda 1
because you can pick it up even when the enemy's alive, so it doesn't have to "fully die" to spawn it. the item's always spawned.
i have no idea why it's still the case for "hide enemy-carried items". i guess phantom menace's logic was that he didn't want people confusing them for items that the enemy *naturally* dropped that blink in only after the death animation
