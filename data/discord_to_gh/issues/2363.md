Here's another one of those silly minor design nitpicks. A lot of items in the editor will have numbers in their names for organization purposes:

Sword 1 (Wooden)
Sword 2 (White)
Sword 3 (Magic)
Sword 4 (Master)

This is handy and keeps the item list ordered and easy to navigate, so I believe it's important for tileset design that items retain this sort of naming scheme. But then when making a quest, you don't want this and tend to end up renaming those items, because the Selected Item Name subscreen object ALSO uses this field. And it's super goofy looking when you're playing a quest and equip the Sword 1 (Wooden). By the end of a quest's design process, its item lists tend to look messy with items from the same class scattered throughout the list.

It would be better if there was a second string field for the item's name when selected in-game.

This is frankly a great suggestion.
Bottles already play with the item name display code to display the name of their contents, so, I know it should be overridable
Script access to the display name is the fancy part
which, is just a copy of the normal name access

=== @ Moosh 05/10/2023 02:43

Oooh! Hadn't even considered that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 02:43

And it can just use the normal name field if the display name is *blank*

=== @ Moosh 05/10/2023 02:43

Might not even need a rule in that case

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 02:43

(to display an actual blank name, you could use a single space)
yeah, it shouldn't

=== @ mitchfork 05/10/2023 02:44

This is a classic Great Moosh Feature Request

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 02:44

I'll also want to hook how bottle contents display into this

=== @ Moosh 05/10/2023 02:44

And here I almost didn't post it because "Surely this only actually bothers me"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 02:45

maybe just use `%s` in the display name as a spot to insert it, just like sprintf
and I can default it to however it works for those now on quest load

=== @ Moosh 05/10/2023 02:45

Was looking through Firebird's item list earlier and that's an example of a tileset that takes the ZC first approach to item naming. It's kinda a nightmare in the editor

=== @ mitchfork 05/10/2023 02:46

(replying to @ Moosh "And here I almost didn't post…"): It would bother me more if I wasn't planning on a scripted subscreen anyway.  But I have a special character schema for putting all of the actual in-use items at the top of the list in buckets: http://puu.sh/JGoGy/c5228bb451.png

=== @ Moosh 05/10/2023 02:47

Oh absolutely I do that trick a lot in development

=== @ mitchfork 05/10/2023 02:47

Enemies get the ! special too

=== @ Moosh 05/10/2023 02:47

And then SLG's quest is like "Allow me to introduce myself" with the massive number of items flagged by special characters

=== @ Moosh 05/10/2023 02:50

(replying to @ mitchfork "It would bother me more if I…"): I notice your triforces are split by dungeon. Is there a reason for that? Firebird has something similar and it had me scratching my head
As far as I know there only needs to be one triforce class item per unique graphic, plus the one Ganon drops

=== @ mitchfork 05/10/2023 02:51

There is - certain NPC's react to specific dungeon clears in Crucible Crest, and they check whether you have that specific Triforce
else I would just have one catch-all

=== @ Moosh 05/10/2023 02:52

Aha. That'd make sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 04:41

@ mitchfork how are you checking for separate triforces?

=== @ mitchfork 05/10/2023 04:41

They're not Triforce items

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 04:41

*ah*, ok

=== @ mitchfork 05/10/2023 04:41

Just custom itemclass

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 04:42

that makes more sense then
You actually, AFAIK, cannot 'own' a `Triforce` class item as an `Equipment Item`

=== @ mitchfork 05/10/2023 04:42

makes sense
it's just incrementing a game counter right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 04:43

No
The triforces are like maps/compasses/boss keys/etc
stored for each level
and, uh

=== @ mitchfork 05/10/2023 04:43

oh, right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 04:43

you *can use SCCs to check for individual triforces*

either a specific triforce, or a minimum number of triforces
scripts can check similarly easily enough
so, no need for separate mcguffin items just to check for them

=== @ mitchfork 05/10/2023 04:44

yeah, I guess I wouldn't need to do it my way then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 04:45

Anyway, back to the topic at hand

```cpp
itemdata->GetDisplayName(char32 buf);
itemdata->SetDisplayName(char32 buf);
itemdata->GetShownName(char32 buf);```
Getter/Setter for the display name field itself
and then `GetShownName`, which gets the actual string as it would appear on the subscreen- which is the normal name if no display name is given, or the display name otherwise, and it includes the bottle contents having already replaced the `%s`.

@ Moosh this all seem good?

=== @ Moosh 05/10/2023 05:54

Looks perfect. Thanks for doing this so quickly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/10/2023 05:55

It was a good idea, *DEAD* easy to add, and I was looking for something to do anyway so a bit of dev was perfect
I'll toss out a nightly with this right away for ya
