Not sure how this wasn't suggested already, but in the Subscreen Editor, when right-clicking on virtually any element, wouldn't it be really useful if there was a "Duplicate" thing so we could quickly copy an element, possibly with all of its properties?  

All it is is a faster method of using the "Edit" -> "Duplicate" thing.  That's literally all this is.  Just adding that to the right-click dialogue.  The included screenshot is where I'm referencing it should be added.

Preferably between "Properties" and "Inspect"  - Because I don't think a lot of people really use the "Inspect" feature.
As far as I'm aware.

If I remember correctly, you can also do this by pressing D

Mm.  This is true.  In fact, now that I'm seeing that for the first time, I cheerfully withdraw my suggestion!  Thanks bunchly.  üëç
