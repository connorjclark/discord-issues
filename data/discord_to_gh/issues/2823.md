1) currently backups only happen on auto saves

2) these save as `qt0`, `qt1`, etc... files. These are limited to 10 variants, and the file open dialog in editor only looks at these. So we've limited to 10 backups, and if you've set it a auto save timer to a few minutes, that means your backups provided by ZC will be at most <hour old. There should be an option to have unlimited backups. 

3) I want to consider saving as plain `qst` files (with a date timestamp in the file name) in a `backups` folder (like what is done for save files)

4) setting backup limit w/ "only N backups" is maybe not as good as specifying a limit in terms of _disk space_.

5) the defaults here IMO should enable auto backups. Having someone lose their quest because we have bad defaults would feel bad

Agreeable

=== @ Alucard648 11/06/2023 04:19

I think, autosaves and backups should be stored in separate folders. Agreeed with rest of points.

```4) setting backup limit w/ "only N backups" is maybe not as good as specifying a limit in terms of disk space.```
If the limit was disk space though, it'd still have to calculate how many backups to make to keep cycling out old ones to make room for new, though, right?
Unless the thought is that it just stops making backups when it runs out of space, which would be bad

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 05:52

It would delete the oldest one
The point was that users set this value with the main constraints of "how much disk space should I let this use", so we should just be more direct and ask that

=== @ Moosh 11/06/2023 05:56

```3) I want to consider saving as plain qst files (with a date timestamp in the file name) in a backups folder (like what is done for save files)```
This makes sense so long as a quest loaded from a backup cannot still be saved as a backup. I recall doing this mistakenly at some point in some past version, didn't even realize I'd loaded a backup, and it make a bit of a mess
Also of course that no quest can be saved to the backups folder, where it could be mistaken for a backup and removed

=== @ Moosh 11/06/2023 06:03

```The point was that users set this value with the main constraints of "how much disk space should I let this use"```
Personally I don't think about it this way. While the purpose of limiting backups is to limit disk space, I don't really think "I've got 600 MB being taken by quest backups, that's too much." I mostly think "Man, all these backups are cluttering up my folders."
which hey, a backups folder would fix that!

=== @ Moosh 11/06/2023 06:04

Though I do still think a number of backups saved is more intuitive than an arbitrary number that's relative to the size of my quest

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 11/06/2023 11:17

some input on that as well: if you give a max size, it's just going to fill up until it hits that, no? meaning you're guaranteed to fill up the space (unless you set it super high, but that means you're killing a lot of hard disk space)
I don't see it being super necessary to go back to a super old version of a quest.
unless I'm misunderstanding how this works

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 11/06/2023 11:19

Also I don't think anyone has an intuitive understanding of how big their quest files are and how fast they grow

=== @ Moosh 11/06/2023 11:22

Idea is that once it hits the max size it searches the folder and deletes the oldest backups until there's room, if I'm understanding

this would rule. i want this so bad. something like questname-yyyymmdd-n.qst would be fantastic
i do think i'd rather the limitation be on number of saves per day (or something like that) rather than disk space? i tend to save my quest about a bajillion times per day (since you have to save it to test it), so my backups folder would fill up extremely quickly
or just number of backups
i dunno. the specifics don't matter, but i'd be way more tempted to use the backups feature if it saved, like, actual quests lol
and not weirdo qt38515138 files

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 20:36

(replying to @ Rambly "and not weirdo qt38515138 fil…"): (I mean, you can just load those the same way you load .qsts)

=== @ Rambly 11/06/2023 20:37

...oh, i legit didn't know that
(although that might be a problem in and of itself - not super intuitive imo)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 20:38

...is it not? How else would they work aside from that?

=== @ Rambly 11/06/2023 20:41

i mean, the default quest dialog open view doesn't show .qt# files as even being openable (granted you can click the dialog to change the view) and beyond that, there's just... really no reason to have a different file extension? no good one that i can think of, anyway
i think there's some conflation going on for me too because they used to save as .qb# files automatically and you used to have to import those, you couldn't load them as quests
there's also *both* auto-backups and auto-saves with retention, which i'm not sure what the point of that is either? i guess one's compressed to save disk space, maybe?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 20:46

(replying to @ Rambly "i mean, the default quest dia…"): Oh, if they don't show, that's a bug

=== @ Rambly 11/06/2023 22:59

they *do* show, they just don't show by default (they show if you select .qt? in the dropdown). sorry if i was confusing, i don't think it's a bug... unless the dialog is *supposed* to show both .qst and .qt? by default?

(i still agree with connor's proposal tho, particularly wrt a backups folder)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 23:04

should probably default to showing any loadable files
though backup folder is definitely a plus regardless yeah

=== @ Rambly 11/06/2023 23:04

yeah, seems like a good idea

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/07/2023 02:49

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...is it not? How else would…"): A different extension for an otherwise equivalent file format is 100% unintutive for _experts_. At most programs would do like ...`.qst.bak`? But `.qtn` with increasing n is pretty novel.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/07/2023 02:52

(replying to @ Rambly "there's also *both* auto-back…"): yeah it seems like these systems could be combined.
