Widgets with a settable Tile(s) like Tile Blocks, Minitiles, Counter Meters, and 2x2 Frames for example, do not update when tiles are moved in the tile editor.

cc @ Moosh  because apparently you did this exact thing before ?
If you don't have the time, that's fine just lmk

I think Emily might be mistaken? I don't think I did do this exact thing before
```            //Check subscreen objects
            //Tried to have a go at this but I think it's a bit too complicated for me at the moment.
            //Might come back to it another time and see what I can do ~Joe123```
Also this comment does not instill me with hope, granted it was talking about the old and icky subscreen

(replying to @ Moosh "I think Emily might be mistak…"): you did something with either tile or combo moving for something else
