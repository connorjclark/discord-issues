Use a checkerboard placeholder like many image processing applications have as a background option for the tile page.

This could be applied to combos as well, though I know there is one issue in that the transparent color is solid on layer 0 which could be a bit confusing.

For combos, could potentially show the transparent color as solid if layer 0 is currently selected and replace it with the checkerboard if another layer is selected.

related to the complex mountain feature I was talking about earlier, though same screenshot, sorry if that's confusing.
I can make a separate feature request post for that

=== @ Moosh 10/03/2023 02:00

This seems to be coming along well though

=== @ Moosh 10/03/2023 02:16

And done.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/03/2023 04:00

Did you prefer to not grid-align it or was that an accident?

=== @ Moosh 10/03/2023 04:03

was intentional because I didn't want it to get mixed up with single color tiles
of course it could still get mixed up with a gray checkerboard tile if it's placed in the wrong spot. I could tweak the offsets of the squares again. Or maybe add a setting that makes the pattern animate?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/03/2023 04:07

shrug, I'd just ask some spriters and go with whatever they prefer
idk about animating, but I think we could do something nicer than ugly greys. like this

(this also has a noticeable 5x5 grid pattern too)

=== @ Moosh 10/03/2023 04:09

It's a dropdown now so I can easily add more colors. The grays are indeed rather ugly, but the color choices are somewhat limited by the palette.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/03/2023 04:10

This is a _tad_ more work, but we can always render an allegro5 bitmap underneath and not be limited by the system palette.
Not suggesting you bother w/ that

=== @ Moosh 10/03/2023 04:11

Actually given how these are used, we could even draw the a5 bitmap _over_
Since they're always drawn in rectangular sections. Unless I wanted to overhaul the tile editor to mask out all the color 0
Which is...not an impossibility ü§î
definitely a bigger project to consider for future

=== @ colin 10/03/2023 07:07

Oh part of my intent was also that the transparent background apply behind tiles with transparency.

Though I guess this all still comes up against the issue when the transparent color is used as a solid color
Anyway I do like how it's coming along regardless

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "idk about animating, but I th‚Ä¶"): This looks wack imo
(replying to @ Moosh "This seems to be coming along‚Ä¶"): very much fw having a checkerboard bg, I think it should be aligned with tiles though
could actually be a subtle tool to double check alignment
not a super big deal but that's my 5 cents

=== @ Moosh 10/03/2023 07:17

it'd be a pretty low effort change if that's the general consensus

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/03/2023 07:18

I think an 8x8 background might be worthwhile to add too if it's not too much extra effort.

=== @ Moosh 10/03/2023 07:18

What about the minimap? That was the big thing that made me wanna offset becuase any map square with a gray palette would be rendered hard to see against the bg

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/03/2023 07:19

Oh that is a bit of a problem.
I feel like that would still be the case whether or not the bg is aligned or not though

=== @ Moosh 10/03/2023 07:19

I can offset them differently

=== @ colin 10/04/2023 03:44

the non-offset grey grid in aseprite has always worked just fine for me. The only time it's hard is if one of your greys is the same as the background grey

I'd probably address that by subtly shifting the shade of grey to be a grey not found in the active cset
8x8 would be OK too, I think offset 16x16 does look a bit awkward
