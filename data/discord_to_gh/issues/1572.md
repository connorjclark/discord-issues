Silly feature request, but, it'd be neat if, in zquest, if you set an item that's usually only a pickup item to be an equipment item, then when the player uses it as a button item, it activates the effect it would normally have when you pick it up.

For example, if you go in the item editor and make a Clock an Equipment Item, and put it on the subscreen, then when the player uses that Clock item, it acts exactly as if they'd picked up the Clock.

The two Items this could make the most sense for are:
- Clock
- Kill All Enemies

But it might be neat for other pickup items such as hearts, magic, or maybe some kind of generic "increase counter when used" type effect.

I realize this is all dead easy to do with zscript, but it might be a neat ease-of-access thing for non-scripters to be able to do this, like having a clock item that costs magic (or is removed after use like a potion, since the item editor already has that option too), etc.
Also, I realize this is a bit of a different idea maybe, but, requiring/spending from an arbitrary counter instead of just from magic/rupees would be nice, if that's not already a feature.

that already is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/26/2022 01:05

(replying to @ Mitsukara "Silly feature request, but, i‚Ä¶"): that... shouldn't be that bad. It'll need an extra flag checked, though

=== @ vlamart 04/26/2022 02:52

This could also make shields active too!

Also both have an SFX now, which plays when the effect activates

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/27/2022 03:23

If `Active Use` is checked, they do... well, that. And they DON'T activate on pickup in that case.

Also added:
-Kill all enemies will not allow you to use it if there's nothing for it to kill (thus NOT charging you, and playing the 'error' sfx if one is set)
-Checkbox for clock to prevent activating it while another clock is active already

The refiller class can refill up to 5 different counters, and optionally cure sword jinxes, when used
If it cannot do anything (i.e. every counter it fills is full and no sword jinx to cure) it will NOT charge its' cost, and will play the 'error' sound to indicate being unable to use it

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíUseable pickup items

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:43

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): Nice! Thank you (Sorry for the late response)

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:45

(replying to @ vlamart "This could also make shields‚Ä¶"): sidenote about my own opinions on the active shield thing: it'd be neat, but it also raise the implication of like, the other behaviors Zelda shields typically have such as prevent contact damage from enemies /pushing certain enemies away (or being able to slowly push urchins like pushblocks, etc) which is probably beyond the scope of new items I think Emily would want to add to pre-rewrite ZC?
although a compromise in between somewhere could still be a neat thing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:45

I added active shields
But it just toggles the shield

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:46

oh, neat
it's something at least

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:46

It does also toggle the LTM
Which is all it does for visual
It also has a sound for when you press the button to pull it out

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:47

hmm... if it only has one LTM, I guess that means the shield just kinda disappears when not in use, rather than being carried around on Link's side like the gameboy games

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:47

Yeah

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:47

I always liked the idea of like, scripting a shield that would actually work on Link's side, like when you're charging the sword in LTTP, but that gets a bit complex
or more generally of being able to put the shield on any of Link's sides
like wearing a shield on his back for instance, and it blocks projectiles from the back

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:48

So, a second ltm, and an altered step speed while holding it, are both good ideas on the table
Shield sidedness sounds like a nightmare

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:48

Yeah, probably a bit much to ask

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:49

Pushing 'urchins'.... would require enemy solidity.
Which, IS still on the todo

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:49

I'm surprised Darknuts even have it, though it's cool they do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:49

The problem is,  making the shield affect multiple sides is easy
Making it affect front in use, side otherwise is a bit odd

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:50

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "The problem is,  making the s‚Ä¶"): huh. Silly suggestion, but, would it be hard to add an option for a multi-sided shield as a form of shield upgrade, then?
I'm not sure how much sense that would make though
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Making it affect front in use‚Ä¶"): not sure I parse this, either, sorry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:51

I mean, if you sprited it as Link glowing with an energy shield or something...
(replying to @ Mitsukara "I always liked the idea of li‚Ä¶"): ^

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:52

oh you mean like, front when used, side when not used. That's not really how it works outside of LTTP though (and then it's only "not in use" when charging the sword)
I was thinking more like.... let's say Link has an item that's a "back shield", it works just like a regular shield, but only on the back. Like as a seperate shield item altogether

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:53

Yeah, exactly why it'd be "a bit odd" to try to get anything working
And ehh
Separate item for the back... would need to be an entire dupe itemclass

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:54

basically I'm thinking of the thing where Darknuts have the "Shielded in front" "shielded on left" etc options

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:55

As flags on an existing shield, it might work
But a separate item specifically for the back is not sane

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:55

So for instance you could make like, a regular shield itemclass item (if that'd be easier), but check a box for saying which sides it covers (multiple sides would be neat though)
so it's like, you upgrade from a level 1 shield item that's just a front shield, to a level 2 shield item that's a front and back shield

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 22:56

That could be doable

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:56

and that would also allow someone to use zscript to toggle it to different sides if they wanted to, without having to like, recreate the entire shield behavior in zscript
so if they wanted the thing where the shield is only covering one side, but it can be moved from  just Link's front to just Link's right side during charging or something, they could script that by toggling between which shield item Link has. (...except I think maybe charging disables shield blocking altogether, which is a seperate problem)

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 22:59

plus it could just be a fun silly thing to have like, a quest where shields are only on Link's back. So you gotta learn to look away from projectiles
or maybe let's say a quest has multiple characters, they could each wear the shield differently (by using a different shield item)

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:02

sorry this mutated into an entirely different, more complex feature request. I could make a new thread if you'd like? I wasn't even sure how viable this idea was so I didn't think to ask for it more directly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 23:03

It's fine

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:03

Although I can say if I do get the quest made in 2.55 that I eventually want to (Memory of Koholint), I would definitely use it

=== @ vlamart 04/29/2022 23:08

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I mean, if you sprited it as‚Ä¶"): Actually I was thinking of doing that like in Wind Waker üòù

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:09

I had these silly Darknut enemies that just... plopped shields onto extra sides. So Link could do that too, just inexplicably wearing extra shields affixed to his sides XD

=== @ vlamart 04/29/2022 23:12

Scripting enemies intimidates me. At first Ghost 3.0 looked promising, but I haven't anything about ghost at all lately

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 23:12

Yeah work on that died

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:12

(the different darknut shield sides thing is an old enemy editor feature that was already in 2.50, no scripts needed)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/29/2022 23:12

Npc scripts are a thing though
And can do a lot, without needing any header

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:13

I never actually learned ghost, although most of my extensive work was in 2.50.2 which didn't have the NPC script slots yet. I had my own janky system where I had the global script (and sometimes, manually placed FFCs) controlling enemies
I would've totally been using NPC script slots if they were a thing yet though
I liked to do a lot of like, simple tricks for existing enemies. Like making a regular aquamentus move up and down, or making a walking enemy jump at random times
it was often a little janky but it got some neat effects

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:16

when learning, it's also good to draw inspiration from really simplistic stuff, like some of the Zelda II enemies or Super Mario Land or games like that, where enemies have extremely simple behaviors- like there's these birds in ZII, Mobys, that just appear at the top of the screen at random horizontal positions, move down until they're aligned with Link, and then move switch to moving left (or right, depending on whether Link is to their left or their right)
dead simple to script those little guys, so it's a good one to learn with

=== @ Mitsukara 04/29/2022 23:17

They also don't have many animation frames XD

=== @ vlamart 04/29/2022 23:34

I'm also gonna practice by trying to recreate some of the Z3 ghost enemies as npc scripts, especially Eyegore. I used to like to make them trees or statues in 2.8

`Protects [dir]` are for all shields, and tell it what sides to protect. For active shields, those are only protected when the button is held.
`Inactive [dir]` is only for active shields, and tell it what sides to *still protect even when you aren't holding the button*

man, between that, bottles, bug net, double jump, and _switch hook_, there's some killer new items built into 2.55 now
