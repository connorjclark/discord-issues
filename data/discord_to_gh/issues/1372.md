I think it is essential when setting up Dmap music. Have the ability to preview track numbers, so quest makers will know what music it is in each track number and select the music they want in the Dmap

Pahahhahahaha
adding new things to music
that sounds absolutely horrifying
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) any chance this is easy? Or is it horrendously ungodly on the level of eldritch abominations?

I'm clueless when it comes to music

could be easy, could not be

I know very little lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2022 13:51

Still far more than my none

I'm saying, have a play/preview track button in the Dmap music tab.

anything touching music is horrendous

(replying to @ cbailey78 "I'm saying, have a play/previ…"): I don't think that'd be too hard...
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) we'd just be copying how ZC handles playing those tracks
