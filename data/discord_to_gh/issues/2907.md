When I open a fresh build, and close it, the cfg gets this value:

```
[ZCMODULE]
current_module = classic.zmod

```

opening zplayer again then fails to find the module

not sure why this just started happening.

but if I uncomment `current_module = modules/classic.zmod` in base_config/zc.cfg it is OK

it was b/c `load_game_configs` got moved around recently and uncovered these bad defaults
