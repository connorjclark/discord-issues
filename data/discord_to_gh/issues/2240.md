```namespace foo{
    class bar{
    
    }
    
    ffc script Test{
        void run(){
            bar b = new bar();
        }
        void ThisDoesNotWork(bar b){
        
        }
    }
}```
If bar declared outside of the namespace foo, this will compile. Same if the ffc script is outside the namespace and using it. Otherwise it will give an error in the function ThisDoesNotWork that type bar has not been declared. If that function is commented out, there is no compile error. So the issue appears to be a class pointer as a function parameter in a function in a namespace when the class declaration is also in that namespace?

...the registration system just wasn't visiting classes that were inside namespaces
and in semantic analyzing, in namespaces, scripts occur before classes- so class `bar` had not yet been processed when it required it to exist.
....a problem that is meant to be solved by the registration system. Easy fix, stupid typo.
