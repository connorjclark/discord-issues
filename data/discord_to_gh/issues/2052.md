In a normal game, after picking up bombs for the first time, they do not actually appear in your inventory until moving to the next screen.  As opposed to in previous versions and the original game, where they appear instantly and even fill your B-button slot if they are the first item picked up.

Similar from bigjoe:

> In the standard 1st quest included in the module you cant select bombs when they are added to your inventory. This is happening with the 11-30 nightly.

^ @ DergerSwerson or is this exactly the same? "can't select" = " does not show"?

aye, sounds like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/07/2022 00:36

feel like this may be related to `selectWpn_new()` or `Bweapon()`, though not sure

Figured it out I think
FlushItemCache isn't being called when the maxcounter of something changes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2022 14:13

huh

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/08/2022 14:16

no, wait, that isn't it either...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/08/2022 14:26

I do think it's an issue with FlushItemCache not being called
cause calling it caused bombs to be added to the inventory when I picked up the next item on the same screen

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/08/2022 14:55

Fixed by adding FlushItemCache to the end of hero.cpp getitem()
