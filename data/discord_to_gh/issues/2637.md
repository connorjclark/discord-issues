In Bananas, there is a gag where your save file name is replaced with Finnigan. In Alpha 117, the name is truncated depending on what the file was named before. For example, if the file name was "Help", it'll be changed to "Finn" when the file name is written to by the script

Oh great catch. That's super weird.

Fixed for next nightly.
