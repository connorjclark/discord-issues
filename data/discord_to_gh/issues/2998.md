Items with IP_TIMEOUT can't be collected until they stop flickering when spawned. However, this generic script event timing will trigger continuously if you collide with the flickering item, even though you haven't collected it.

aah, dammit
easy fix

...except there will be a side-effect
if it's a `Combine when collected twice` type item, it'll now be the *combined* item instead of the *pre-combine* item....
....I feel like that makes sense anyway?
