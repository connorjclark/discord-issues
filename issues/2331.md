When I adjust counter properties in Lock Block Wizard -> Locking, adjustments other than amount aren't saved. It always defaults back to keys after saving. This is in 2.55 Alpha 113, though I'm not completely sure if the new nightlies have addressed this.

Nothing to do with this would have changed in nightlies, since no one reported this until now
thanks for the report!

=== @ xanadude 04/19/2023 22:59

no problem!

Ahk, so I actually worked on this dialog some *without* fixing this report because I forgot about it, so may have fixed some of it then
but, the bit I found that was still wrong, was simply that it wasn't saving the flag 4 (the `Counter` flag)
which, without that saving, it wouldn't use the counter info, or load it when opening the wizard again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 19:26

...ah, and it also couldn't load that same flag, even if it were saving. Typos on both ends.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 19:28

....and the radio buttons below that were also not reading properly.
Yeah, this wizard was a bit fucked, wasn't it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 19:32

should be fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 19:34

Ah, and it was exactly the same broken for locked chests, fixed there too
