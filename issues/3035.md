I have created a combo which is triggered by most LWEAPONS. Upon being triggered, the combo is SUPPOSED to destroy the LWEAPON and play an SFX upon doing so. 

The caveat is that this combo also has an inherent flag to be triggered by fire, switching to the Burn (Any Fire) secret combo. 

I am essentially trying to create a single combo that has different effects based on what triggers it.

The inherent flag actually functions as expected, but I think something about it is causing the LWEAPON component of the combo to malfunction. See the attached quest file for an example.

Load in to Map 13. Screen 62. Try to shoot an arrow, swing your sword across the pit, etc, at the ice surrounding the crystal switch. Notice the crash. Now try with the candle, and notice how it functions properly.

A120 is old. Update first?
Or if it isn't actually 120 share the version in the launcher Update tab

=== @ Matthew 02/03/2024 22:27

Ok, I just updated from A120 to the latest nightly via the launcher

Can confirm the issue persists

So the weapons triggers combos in `findcombotriggers`, which clears all weapons:

```
if(cmb.triggerflags[3] & combotriggerCLEARLWEAPONS)
    Lwpns.clear(true);
```
...but then the weapon animation code that triggered this deletion is stil going, so it quickly crashes on accessing freed memory.
Two options:

1) detect when a weapon decides to delete itself after any of the combo trigger calls. If it did, instantly end the `::animate`

...bleh. Needs a similar solution to RUNSCRIPT_SELFDELETE

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/04/2024 01:21

2) Defer the deletion until in between sprite animate calls

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/04/2024 01:27

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "2) Defer the deletion until i…"): this seems simple

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/04/2024 01:51

ok it was almost simple

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/04/2024 01:59

@ Matthew thanks for the excellent repro, couldn't have been simpler
Trying out the fix in CI now.

Happy to help!
