This is a minor thing but I think having an inbetween of the spin attack and hurricane spin would be kinda nifty, hence the tornado spin item concept. With it being quicker to charge up than the hurricane spin but only have like maybe 5 or so spins in comparison to the Hurricane Spin's 20 spins

I suppose a 3rd level of charge could be doable

the things i'd really like to see improved in charged attacks is
1. flash cset for the colourblind
2. a rule or item setting to make it not use the cost until you actually release the button (aka you can't get hit and lose the cost before you've actually let the attack rip)
