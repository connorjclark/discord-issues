The Bug net ignores Link Tile Modification while using the Bug Net.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/31/2022 04:26

That solves it?
i will try hold on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2022 04:26

Tile modifiers only apply to a certain set of the player's animations if that isn't checked

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/31/2022 04:27

Ok.
I still need to see if it fixes it
hold on am checking now
Ok i already had it checked

Its been checked the whole time during the error too.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/31/2022 04:30

I am using certain numbers to tell the Link sprites what sprite to use when you get a new ring.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/31/2022 04:35

I tested it again and yes the checkbox is checked it's still doing it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2022 04:40

what happens if you slash a sword?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/31/2022 04:41

It does not mess up when you slash sword
only Bug Net does this.
i might have to try all the weapons.
actually hold on
this will take me time to check
.*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2022 04:48

This bug does not happen for me in a fresh quest
I would assume it's a script issue?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/31/2022 04:59

Ok I checked every item
Only the Bug Net is glitched.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2022 04:59

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I would assume it's a script…"): ^

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/31/2022 04:59

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I would assume it's a script…"): I will check with my scripter Daniel then
Oh wait
did you use tile modification though? for link?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2022 05:00

...yes, that was the bug you reported, so obviously I did

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/31/2022 05:00

Oh ok
Ty
i will check with him then.

=== @ DergerSwerson 11/03/2022 07:53

With exhorbitant amounts of rings the bugnet just freaks out. Thats all i know >_< its the only item that does this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2022 11:47

(replying to @ DergerSwerson "With exhorbitant amounts of r…"): Do you have all of the sprites set up for all of the tile modifier values?
The `Slash 2` sprite is basically only used by the bug net, so I'd double check that that sprite is set up correctly...

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/04/2022 00:17

Am going to check the slash 2 sprites now.*
hold on

=== @ DergerSwerson 11/04/2022 00:28

I created hardcode script to try to "get around" the bug, but it still happens when facing right. Here is the script.
```itemdata script frame_reserve{
void run(){
int ring_counter = 15;
while(true){

ring_counter--;

if(ring_counter == 13){
if(Hero->Dir == DIR_UP){Hero->ScriptTile = 113702 + Hero->TileMod;}
if(Hero->Dir == DIR_DOWN){Hero->ScriptTile = 113705 + Hero->TileMod;}
if(Hero->Dir == DIR_LEFT){Hero->ScriptTile = 113708 + Hero->TileMod;}
if(Hero->Dir == DIR_RIGHT){Hero->ScriptTile = 113711 + Hero->TileMod;}
}
if(ring_counter <= 1){Hero->ScriptTile = -1;}
if(ring_counter <= -1){Quit();}
Waitframe();
}
}
}```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 00:28

you shouldn't need a hardcode
\`\`\`cpp
code here\`\`\`

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/04/2022 00:30

The bug is almost fixed, but, it only messes up when facing right with this script.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 00:30

if there's an actual bug then this is not a fix
it's a workaround

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/04/2022 00:30

?
Oh
yeah, we have been trying work arounds

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 00:30

(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl "Am going to check the slash 2…"): ^ did you find anything with these?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/04/2022 00:31

No
What sprite exactly
needs to be targeted for
Slash 2?
Am i using the wrong sprites?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 00:31

Screenshot the tiles it's targetting
and then screenshot where it's targetting PLUS howevermany tiles your tile modifier is when it isn't working

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/04/2022 00:32

In the middle i was using the first sprite on the left over the jumping flipping sprites a top the jumping sprites

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 00:33

what is the tile modifier value when the bug occurs

=== @ DergerSwerson 11/04/2022 00:33

oh. i think i know what might be happening

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/04/2022 00:33

?

=== @ DergerSwerson 11/04/2022 00:34

slash 2 is targetting the wrong page entirely! I think
let me look

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/04/2022 00:35

Ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 00:35

that would do it

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/04/2022 00:35

Daniel i will send you quest.* hold on

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/04/2022 00:52
