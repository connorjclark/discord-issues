Initial Data boxes are broken. First page you can't hit cancel

wah
wtf
presuming this is in the build just posted?
Does it occur in the previous build?

=== @ Jared 09/17/2021 01:15

Yes this is the build you just put up
I don't think it happened on the one before, but I don't remember

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:26

so it seems that the frames are all messed up
and the cancel button is just not working because a frame is in front of it, no other reason

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:29

@ Saffith any idea why `jwin_frame_proc` is messed up?

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:30

Nope, I didn't touch that one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:31

...also
```cpp
do                                             \
{                                              \
    if(dlg->flags&D_NEW_GUI)                   \
    {                                          \
        int ret = new_gui_event(dlg-1, event); \
        if(ret >= 0)                           \
            return ret;                        \
    }                                          \
} while(false)```
why `do {} while(false)`?

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 01:31

the button works, you just can't just use the mouse to click on it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:31

yeah, because the frame is in the way

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 01:32

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:32

when you click, only the top widget at that position gets the click message

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 01:32

gotcha

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:34

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "why `do {} while(false)`?"): It's basically a trick to make it work like a regular statement.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:35

...why not just do `{}`
```cpp
{                                              \
    if(dlg->flags&D_NEW_GUI)                   \
    {                                          \
        int ret = new_gui_event(dlg-1, event); \
        if(ret >= 0)                           \
            return ret;                        \
    }                                          \
}```
would that not work identically?
oh
I see
....that's...... kinda jank as fuck
but ok
> Of course, it could (and probably should) be argued at this point that it would be better to declare BAR as an actual function, not a macro.

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:37

Yeah, but I wanted it to be able to return from the proc.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:37

you'd just do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:39

```cpp
int GUI_EVENT(DIALOG* d, int event)
{
    if(d->flags&D_NEW_GUI)
        return new_gui_event(d-1, event);
    return -1;
}```
then
```cpp
int ret = GUI_EVENT(d, whatever);
if(ret >= 0) return ret;
```
....meh, either way
not a big deal

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:40

I prioritized minimizing the code changes in the existing procs, basically.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:40

fair

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:40

Anyway, I'm not seeing a problem with the frames myself...
And it doesn't look like anything weird happened to the code.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:41

oh, is it a windows only issue, just like the sprite invisibility?
that sounds fucking fun

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:41

Yep, seems to be.
And it's pretty simple, so I have no clue what the problem could be.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:41

oh ffs
question
you changed some function pointer stuff to no longer use `(*func)(params)` but instead `func(params)`
I'm guessing that's a c++ change?
I'm guessing something to do with `==` on func pointers is different
which would break `large_dialog()`

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 01:42

No, that was to do with the new ListData.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:42

and likely cause something approximately like this
oh
hmmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 01:49

well it appears not to be broken in small mode
so my suspicion of `large_dialog` seems correct

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:07

hmm,no
they are *only* broken in the init data dlg
wtf
only in init data, and only in large mode....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:11

. . .
and ONLY in ZQ
the same fucking dialog launched via the cheats menu in ZC
fucking works fine
WHAT THE SHIT

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:13

. . .I just have no clue
This does not make sense
whatsoever
the code is shared between ZC and ZQ
and the large_dialog code is shared by multiple dialogs
only this dialog, only in ZQ, is affected
this should *not be possible*
.....I have a fucking jank way to fix it, which I'm gonna do
(just remove the frames)

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:15

Have you tried rebuilding from scratch to rule out some sort of build error?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:15

aye, multiple times
that's always the *first* thing I try

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:16

Welp, that's the only logical explanation I had.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:16

I would say cosmic rays
but uh
that would need to be occurring every single time
which uh, not likely
there is no logical explaination for this, it is the new boogie-man
...time to jank around it.
(Replacing the init data dialog with a new gui system thing at some point would be wonderful)
(though, needs a lot of stuff)

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:18

Well, good excuse to do it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:22

looks a bit odd with the frames missing
but, for now, it will do
that gui will be a mountain of a project to rewrite, considering it's >3k indexes
but, a lot of that is generated in a loop
for the LItem stuff
....could probably do that in some saner way
