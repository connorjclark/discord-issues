Another use for mirror/prism combos; have a "light source" combo, which can either shoot a light beam in a direction, or in place (as a spotlight). Standing in a light beam with a mirror shield (probably a reflect flag for this if available?) will redirect the beam in Link's facing direction.
Also, a "light trigger" combo; when every light trigger combo on the screen has a beam hitting it, trigger screen secrets / open shutters

Triggers that trigger when lit, and triggers that trigger if NOT lit; triggering all of them triggers screen secrets
light beams that can use varying colors, or optionally use tiles
bounce off of mirrors duplicate with prisms
and can be blocked or reflected by shields with a flag

pogu

=== @ P-Tux7 11/29/2021 16:51

how do the light beams spawn

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2021 16:51

spotlight combo type
the beam either can be supplied a tile (from which it takes a set of tiles), or 3 colors (from which it generates a default beam graphic)

^In this screenshot, there are 3 lantern icons (light triggers).
The topmost blue requires a blue light beam to touch it.
The bottom blue requires that NO blue beam be touching it.
The red one requires a red beam touch it.
Only once all 3 of those conditions are satisfied does it trigger secrets.
You can have up to 32 different `types` of beam - as far as ones that only trigger certain triggers
you can have infinite different graphics, though

=== @ P-Tux7 11/29/2021 16:54

so you can trigger a combo with the wand's magic or reflected magic to make it turn into a spotlight... but can you have the magic's direction influence which direction the beam spawns?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2021 16:55

no
the combo has a set direction it shoots light in
it can shoot in any of the 4 directions, or straight at the ground
the latter being great for a beam you need to stand in with the mirror shield
you can have a shield that reflects the beams, but you can also have a shield that *blocks* the beams

=== @ P-Tux7 11/29/2021 16:58

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "no"): this would be a great flag option

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2021 16:58

not really possible
what you want there
is a want secret flag
....that does a different secret based on weapon direction
that's no small ask

=== @ P-Tux7 11/29/2021 16:59

well can you make the spotlight combo ITSELF not generate its beam until prompted by a weapon?
(we cant yet i mean YOU)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2021 17:00

....not really, without rewriting everything about how it works
not an easy ask
and then you'd want a flag for making a weapon trigger's *direction* influence it
that's pretty damn specific
easily something to say `script it`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/29/2021 17:01

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "that's pretty damn specific"): magic mirrors/3-way prisms

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2021 17:01

what about them

=== @ P-Tux7 11/29/2021 17:02

they have different behaviour based on where the reflected LWeapon hits them
and have since 1.92

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2021 17:02

that's not combo code
it's weapon code
for the weapons

=== @ P-Tux7 11/29/2021 17:02

oh god WHAT

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2021 17:02

completely different
prism combos don't DO anything
things do things when they HIT prism combos
Spotlight combos DO something, innately

=== @ P-Tux7 11/29/2021 17:03

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "things do things when they HI‚Ä¶"): that is so fucked up, i thought the mirror/prism combo was like "delete this LWeapon and make another one based on the first one's direction"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2021 17:04

no, the weapon is like `I hit a mirror, copy myself based on my direction`
fun times
anyway, feel free to play with this feature
#deleted-channel posted a nightly

=== @ P-Tux7 11/29/2021 17:04

i am disgusted
though, i wonder if that means mirrors work on layers? note to self...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2021 17:07

Not sure
Though for the purpose of light beams, everything works on all layers

=== @ P-Tux7 11/30/2021 17:05

what's a glass combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/30/2021 18:28

Even if solid light beams go through it

=== @ P-Tux7 11/30/2021 19:11

ooh

=== @ vlamart 12/01/2021 20:55

Is there an example of tile setups?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/01/2021 20:56

Uhhh not that I posted
If you click the `?` on the combo type (or maybe on the tile attribute) it should list the order
Not home to grab my example qst

(replying to @ vlamart "Is there an example of tile s‚Ä¶"): for the record, classic in current nightly has the tiles set up
