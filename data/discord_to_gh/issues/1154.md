`bool Hero->Grabbed`, as `Hero->Eaten`, but for wallmasters instead of like-likes

sorry for the trouble
i thought this was a legitimate thing already

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:14

No trouble, it should have been
the fact that it was missed is silly

=== @ P-Tux7 11/03/2021 15:14

i wonder if Hero->Winded should exist too, for both the whistle and enemy wind

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:14

uhhh
`Hero->Action == LA_INWIND` IIRC

=== @ P-Tux7 11/03/2021 15:14

ah good

anyway, this should be added, will be in next build
(It's just read/write of an already existing engine variable; though I doubt writing it will do much of anything in most cases, as there isn't a way to link it to an enemy, so most likely it will just ignore writes)
(took like 2 minutes to add)
(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒Hero-Grabbed
