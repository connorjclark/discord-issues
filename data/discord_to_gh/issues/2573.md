`git blame` traces this back to a bad refactor 2 months ago by connor
should be fixed
also @ Deathrider, was it you having issues with `Shooter` combos on ffcs? because uh, that's the same bug as this.

I believe this was the bug report that addressed the trigger group unlit torch. I have set the unlit trigger group torch to the FFC a sfx when it is triggered, and the FFC torch does not play the sound when triggered. It is triggering as intended otherwise, just no trigger sfx
