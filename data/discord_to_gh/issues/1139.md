Why this warp type is still missing?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 01:16

huh... that's true...
do you mean like a z1 staircase warp
or the fade to white warp
the former has a quicker fade in and fade out than the latter

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 01:19

also huh i wonder if the fade to white and zap warps use a hardcoded white colour

=== @ Alucard648 10/28/2021 02:28

Former one.

=== @ Alucard648 10/28/2021 02:55

like a z1 staircase warp, but instant variety

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 04:34

maybe this can be renamed to be more specific

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 03:18

wait @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) what warp animation do warping pitfalls use

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2021 03:22

the one set in the tile warp they use, IIRC?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 04:02

oh mm
i think we need two new warp types
the z1 quick stair fade to black
and the lttp pit warp fade to black
time for me to count frames...

=== @ Alucard648 11/24/2021 09:24

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the one set in the tile warp…"): And side warps.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 14:45

....no?
don't think pits use sidewarps

=== @ Alucard648 11/26/2021 06:15

Falling off bottom of the screen in sideview areas.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2021 13:52

That isn't a pitfall combo
