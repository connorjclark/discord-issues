Don't know exactly when this broke, but this is working in a110 and is no longer working.

if you can narrow it down more that would be wonderful

Doing a rough bisect:
a110 - working
nightly 2-22 - broken
a111 - working
nightly 12-21 - working
nightly 01-31 - working
nightly 02-05 - working

urgh, actually i'm not testing this correctly.  Ignore the above.

This isn't a bug.  The script that was not working WAS setting Hero->Stun each frame... but only setting it to 1.  This was causing it to count down to zero when Link's status/movement was being set each frame.

I had another script running that was also setting Hero->Stun and working - the only difference I thought there was was the Hero->Z when they were running.  But turns out I had made some bad assumptions
