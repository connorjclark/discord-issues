Midis never play. Digital audio plays, sound effects play, midi's simply don't.

using Linux Mint, which i *believe* is Ubuntu 22.04

Included is a log from trying to run a quest.

in particular, 
`audio    W         kcm_stream.c:651  _al_kcm_refill_stream            [   0.15938] Out of buffers`

seems consistent
this is alpha 112 btw

=== @ Entropy 03/11/2023 20:40

2.50.2 plays midi just fine so this is specifically an alpha 112 problem

=== @ Entropy 03/16/2023 03:55

lmk if there's not enough info or can't reproduce

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2023 03:47

we only have one linux dev so it might be a bit

=== @ fon 03/30/2023 12:18

I have a similar issue on Kubuntu 22.10:

The allegro.log shows the very same "Out of buffers" warning but it affects all sound, even system sounds and other applications while ZC is running.
Sound plays but it's crackling and echoing. The latter is especially noticable with sound effects because they always play twice.
Ubuntu 22.10 introduces PipeWire as the default audio server, so I had to install pipewire-alsa to get sound to work at all.
I can't test sound on ZC 2.50.2 since it can't find ALSA.

=== @ fon 04/10/2023 16:17

I just noticed that MIDIs *don't* play for me either. I had just assumed that 1st Quest uses MIDIs but it uses NSF. Everything but MIDI seems to play but again, it's crackling and echoing.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/27/2023 02:16

Folks, you'll need to do some legwork on your end to get MIDIs working, if you don't have a hardware midi soundcard. Some details here: https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=78117&p=1073401

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Folks, you'll need to do some…"): > In QSynth set fluid as the driver, 
where would I do this? "fluid" is not an option for either "MIDI Driver" under the MIDI tab or "Audio Driver" under the Audio tab

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 09:46

i've managed to get the alsa and pulseaudio audio drivers to output audio with vkeydb, but neither seems to work with ZC
jack consistently outputs nothing

current qsynth settings

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/29/2023 16:35

Did you install fluid?

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 20:32

it's listed as an installed package and i assume qsynth wouldn't be working without it because it's a GUI for fluid

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 20:36

yep, version 2.2.5-1

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 20:54

tried reinstalling qsynth and fluid, no dice

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/29/2023 21:25

Sorry for the misleading instructions, I also have the same settings (there is no fluid driver)
With your settings, does the virtual midi piano work?
> Try installing fluidsynth (as you already have), and a sound font. In QSynth set alsa as the audio driver, and alsa_seq as the midi driver, and configure the soundfont. If you install vkeybd you can quickly verify things are working. Once you hear sound from the virtual MIDI keyboard, it should just work in ZC.
(Edited this in my comment on pzc)
only difference is i have this soundfont

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 21:48

the midi piano does work, midi doesn't play in either ingame or the built-in midi player
i've since changed the soundfont to match yours, no dice

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 22:06

did just check to make sure the midi volume is audible and it's maxed out

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/29/2023 22:07

Have you tested the tune player in zquest? in Etc menu (Lost Woods, etc.)
There's also a `nosound` config option, make sure that's not accidentally set. Other than that, I've no idea what the problem could be, sorry

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 22:20

tuneplayer similarly does not work
i don't know i guess i'll mess around and see what happens?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/29/2023 22:26

I'm surprised the midi piano would work but not ZC. Might be something interesting in the allegro log file
Sorry if this is dumb to suggest, but make sure Qsynth is open when ZC/ZQ is started (and remains open).

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 22:27

that is the case

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1083933211786215435/1112869880614621284/image.png?ex=65e64ad7&is=65d3d5d7&hm=6bc531cd58577f423d07884e572cc9235713c743ccb6624bd080fedf8f888cbe&)
fluidsynth outputs this when the piano is opened
which makes me think, since this doesn't happen with ZC, it's not trying to connect
let me paste the allegro.log
actually let me try to *run a quest* first
might be more informative

this, maybe?

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 22:38

it tends to spam "out of buffers" a lot

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/29/2023 22:46

(replying to @ Entropy "it tends to spam "out of buff…"): That can be ignored, I see it too.
> alsa     W               alsa.c:686  alsa_allocate_voice              [   0.31138] Falling back to non-mmapped transfer.

This I do not see.

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 22:51

interesting

=== @ Entropy 05/29/2023 23:07

so what does this mean I wonder

=== @ Entropy 06/09/2023 08:24

well, after like a week of fiddling around with various components i know nothing about
i fixed the issue by not fixing it
running ZC's windows version through proton causes Qsynth to work perfectly
...so i guess that's what i'm doing lmao
