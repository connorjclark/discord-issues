In the "Chest (Basic) Combo, click the Help Button to the right of the Combo Type pulldown.  Read the first word.  That's in Alpha 106.

ack
that's definitely not a standard typo, it's a string format error

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/06/2022 23:04

hmmmmm

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 06/06/2022 23:04

I figured.  I just didn't know what to call it.  It just looks like Cthulhu had sneezed on it or something.

```cpp
case cCHEST: case cLOCKEDCHEST: case cBOSSCHEST:
    typehelp = "If no button is assigned, the chest opens when pushed against from a valid side. If buttons are assigned,"
        " then when the button is pressed while facing the chest from a valid side.\n"
        "When the chest is opened, if it has the 'Armos/Chest->Item' combo flag, the player will recieve the item set in the screen's catchall value, and the combo will advance to the next combo.";
    if(id==cLOCKEDCHEST)
        typehelp += "\nRequires a key to open.";
    else if(id==cBOSSCHEST)
        typehelp += "\nRequires the Boss Key to open.";
    break;
```
that.... is a basic string assignment
no form of formatting happening there

Does it look like that on your end? 😮
I mean in regular ZQuest on your PC?

...OH MY
This is a random memory error
because I am stupid

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 06/06/2022 23:06

I dunno.  Seem to be pretty smart to be able to determine that in the first place.
I was about to refresh my RAM.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/06/2022 23:08

oh well you see
it's returning the string from one function
then it stores that in a *local variable*
and then it returns a *pointer to the content of the local variable*
....returning a pointer to anything to do with a local variable means you're pointing to memory that no longer is controlled, and is thus random
and uh, this isn't just chests or anything

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 06/06/2022 23:09

Ah.  I appreciate the explanation and the education.  Very interesting! 😮

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/06/2022 23:09

this issue is with every combo
but, random memory be random

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 06/06/2022 23:12

Thanks, I'll try that.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 06/06/2022 23:13

Yep, no weird text in the description of the same combo type help.  Thanks!
