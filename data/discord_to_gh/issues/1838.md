Go to just about any menu, start dragging the bar up and down, then, move up and down through the menu, then drag the bar again, repeat until there is a freeze. I'm quite capable of reproducing it if a video or such is needed.

here is an example of crashing ZC. The part at the end where it hangs is where it crashed

it took me longer than it does on average to reproduce it there, which is why i got a little TOO rough

first is main thread

Second is a5 render thread (the memory access that triggered a crash)
although this is the launcher.... So maybe not same crash
But could be related

i think i have this bug, happened 2 times today, holding down the mouse and scrolling the stuff in a menu seems to freeze the editor in my case

(meta) thread name was changed: 💥Getting too rough with a menu = ZQuest Freeze

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/13/2022 22:38

```
rectfill(screen, zc_max(0,m->x), zc_max(0,m->y), zc_min(m->x+m->w-1, screen->w), zc_min(m->y+m->h-1, screen->h), scheme[jcBOX]);```
That line just crashed in `static void draw_menu(MENU_INFO *m)` in `jwin.cpp`
and

so `screen->vtable` is being fucked up
that, uh, doesn't seem good? @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/13/2022 22:41

it seems to happen EXTREMELY easily while I am attached to the debugger?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/13/2022 22:57

try doing it was ASAN enabled
_what_ is corrupted is largely irrelevant

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/13/2022 23:08

Not sure how to set that up right now
and, was not even trying to debug this issue
I was working on #1858, which, given it involves scrollpanes, crashed on me quite a bit.
