It would be neat if screen messages could be displayed at negative Y coordinates and appear on top of the passive subscreen, so you could have the text window replace the passive subscreen. (Not sure how this would interact with layer 6/7 stuff, as the "passive subscreen above sprites" rule creates layer 7.)
Also if I posted this before and forgot, I apologize

Don't think I've heard this idea before
though, with layer 7 existing
the string would appear UNDER the subscreen

=== @ Mitsukara 08/11/2022 00:01

ah
not sure how feasible it would be to change the layer order on messages with like, the message editor or something

(replying to @ Mitsukara "not sure how feasible it woul…"): ....That.... makes way too much sense.
It won't be the simplest add, but it's certainly doable, and sounds worthwhile.

Hooray!

defaults to `6` for old quests, and cleared strings

Should be an automatic nightly at midnight, just pushed this so it'll be included

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅Screen messages above passive subscreen
