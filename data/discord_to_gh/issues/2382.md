A QR that affects the "heal enemies" LWeapon defence and fixes the overflow/loop error Moosh brought up. With this QR on, when the heal defence is used, the enemy checks its HP against the value its enemy ID has as its starting HP, and if its current HP is more than its default, it clamps it down to the default. This would ideally only run when the enemy heal defence does so as to avoid enemies checking their starting HP *every frame.*
