Changing the bomb's weapon type affects both the bomb and it's blast

i don't see this as an issue

Emily told me to

=== @ P-Tux7 08/30/2021 07:45

the problem that i see is the lit bomb being able to trigger defenses but that's not what you wrote

=== @ Guinevere 08/30/2021 07:46

i mean i'm sure it gets the point across, i don't think the bomb itself should have a hitbox once a weapon type is added on to the item
seems a lil silly

the weapon type effect should not apply to the bomb
it should still behave as a bomb

=== @ Guinevere 08/30/2021 07:48

and if the lit bomb comes into contact with an enemy, it kills the item and hurts the enemy like a normal lweapon

Ooh, nice

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 17:26

also did a similar thing with defenses too
(the "use defense" thing)

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 17:33

super bombs too?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 17:36

yup
though I initially was confused because I thought wBomb was LW_BOMB, but no, it's LW_BOMBBLAST
