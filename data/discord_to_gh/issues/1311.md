I have no idea if this is even possible, and it's certainly extremely low on the scale of usefulness, but here's the thought:

Separate vertical/horizontal sprites for the Hookshot hook and the Hookshot chain when retracting and after having been fired.

So you could have an open grabby-style metal hookshot hook hurtling towards a wooden target, its rope loose and wavy trailing behind it, but then the hook hits its target and visibly closes, and the rope goes taut and turns into a straight line as it pulls you towards it.

Also, a specific sound when contact is made.  But I suppose that's a separate suggestion.

Thoughts?  Is this feasible and reasonable, or unthinkable and unblinkable.

I like this idea, it would be also neat to add the switchhook teleportation animation/sprites to the hookshot (or at least just the poof)

Yep, it's a fun thing to think about.
