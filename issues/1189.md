itemclass for this, gives you the item indicated by all 10 attributes, set them to -1 to ignore them

=== @ P-Tux7 11/17/2021 05:20

there's an item 0?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 05:21

green rupee is item 0 by default
but, technically, since that's editable..... it could be anything
so, using -1 is safer

=== @ P-Tux7 11/17/2021 05:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "but, technically, since that'‚Ä¶"): yeah i know
no problem

=== @ P-Tux7 12/09/2021 04:49

by the way, these should probably have a flag to run the associated items' pickup scripts or not
just one all or none checkbox, not individually or anything

Bundle of `Bow` + `Arrow`
The Bow has `Increase Arrows/Max Arrows by 10`
which you can see is applied properly

btw is there logic for what happens when you pick up item bundles that contain "merging" items
i.e. if you have a blue potion and pick up an item bundle that has a blue potion in it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 06:59

err, no

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 07:01

it acts as though they were given by SCC
which doesn't handle merging

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 07:01

i was thinking of this cause of the arrow upgrade example you posted

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 07:01

That's not a blue potion pickup

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 07:01

mm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 07:01

that's a `Progressive Item`
a separate thing

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 07:01

well yeah
oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 07:01

and that will be handled, I think

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 07:02

mm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 07:02

granting a progressive item by SCC grants the next item in the progression
so granting it by item bundle should do the same

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 07:02

maybe i should request a qr for item sccs/bundles handle merging items
because a shop scc such as on a signpost could give you a potion after all

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 07:04

or an npc that gives you a potion as a reward

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 07:05

gimme a minute

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 07:06

oh really? thanks
