Was helping Nightmare combine a global script with a file forked from 1st.qst. In the process I found an issue where none of my global arrays were initializing properly. The cause seems likely to be related to the script assignment dialog reporting that ~Init is _missing_

Normally that says ~Init but here it has the same -- as a script that was previously in the file but later removed from the buffer. Adding an init script to the quest did not fix the global array issue though, so I suspect something got broken by the slot's name changing at all. And the user isn't able to fix it in any way as the slot is reserved

=== @ Moosh 03/19/2022 08:52

It's possible this issue could affect more older quests than just the pack-in ones, Nightmare reported it was happening on his New Quest file as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/19/2022 14:37

wtf

=== @ NightmareJames 03/19/2022 15:01

Do you need any test files @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ?
(like quests, zs files, etc.)?

=== @ NightmareJames 03/19/2022 15:14

Just FYI, this is also a problem with the packaged-in quest as well, not just my variant

And New "2022":

=== @ Moosh 03/19/2022 21:09

Oh, so new quest _doesn't_ have the issue then?

new quests appear to be fine
gotta be a versioning issue of some sort

=== @ Moosh 03/19/2022 21:35

New Quest as in the one by Nightmare. From forever ago. If it was version based I'd expect that one to be broken

=== @ NightmareJames 03/19/2022 21:45

(replying to @ Moosh "Oh, so new quest _doesn't_ ha‚Ä¶"): Apparently not, but 1st and 2nd sure do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/19/2022 21:47

that's... confusing

=== @ NightmareJames 03/19/2022 21:48

I'll check Demo Jer/PM when I wake later

=== @ NightmareJames 03/19/2022 21:49

As 1st, 2nd, DemoJer, 3rdEX (not publically available), and New are the oldest quests in existance
In that order

=== @ NightmareJames 03/20/2022 01:19

Demo Jer/PM V 2.55:  (anything else you want me to look up besides 3rdEX please let me know)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/26/2022 19:27

Can you find the last build that this was not an issue in?
because I have no fucking idea what is wrong here

=== @ NightmareJames 03/26/2022 19:38

OK, might be a while though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/26/2022 19:38

I might have a band-aid fix
but, it likely just masks a deeper problem
(band-aid fix being... just force the name to `~Init` every single compile)

this will hopefully band-aid it

=== @ NightmareJames 03/28/2022 11:01

Definitely band aids it:  I'll further test it at a later date for complications
Mark this as sick please
