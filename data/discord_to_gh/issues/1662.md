...oh.
that....would happen if that was large, wouldn't it?
it should just need a `maxwidth` property added to the textfields
if you'd want to add that

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) how does this do?

I just set `forceFitW = true` for both of them
so, their width is not accounted for in calculating the column's width, and their width is then forced to the column's calculated width.
The problem being, the default width of a textfield, is based on it's starting value
so without that to override the width, it scaled with the input

I sometimes get garbage data here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 00:03

only when I get to this str length

probably reading the code wrong, maybe not relevant
but only happens when I make the path a bit longer than normal

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 00:06

GAH

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 00:06

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "but only happens when I make‚Ä¶"): nvm i think it may just be random

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 00:06

Any chance you can figure out what's wrong there??

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 00:06

i'll look a bit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 00:07

I have no clue how string_view stuff works and everywhere I've had to fuck with it has been absolutely confusing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 02:16

started looking. consistent repro but string has to be at least 60 characters

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 02:18

idk what this function is doing but, maxLength is smaller than the string I'm passing in...

Can't textfeld just use a std::string as a member var? why the dance with `std::unique_ptr<char[]>` ??

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 02:23

std::string doesn't seem like it'd be an awful choice, but better than a pointer to char[]* might be std::array<char>

way too much on the topic here, I just scanned it https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56422913/are-there-downsides-to-using-stdstring-as-a-buffer

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 03:39

found the issue. although the string buffer stuff is probably more complicated than it needs to be, it isn't the bug here.

In `realize` these dialog objects are made only at initialization
but they are given references to the raw buffer pointer
which is invalidated whenever the text field buffer is resized.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Can't textfeld just use a std‚Ä¶"): Ask @ Saffith

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 08:42

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) should fix it, I hope?

It should properly update the reference there
