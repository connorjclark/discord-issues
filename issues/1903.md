https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/913210750095458304 Still kinda hoping this get added. I still think it would be a great addition to classic styled quests.
I never did get a definitive yea/nay on this one.

Honestly at this point I'd feel more inclined to just make a duplicate identical Dmap on another map, and replicate the experience there.  It'd be a ton of identical screens and no player map marker anywhere to show actual movement.

Some slight scripting shenanigans (VERY light though.  Easily codable by anyone.) to have an invisible FFC check for the item, and if you have it, make a SFX.  So when you're going the right way, a bell sounds.  If you're not, no bell.

I am suggesting to rename this item to Hint Bell, as it can be used with other puzzles. As for script access...
```void PlayHintBell(int I_HINTBELL){
    if (Hero->Item[I_HINTBELL]){
        itemdata it = Game->LoadItemData(I_HINTBELL);
        Game->PlaySound(it->UseSound);
    }
}```

Neat.  What does this line do?  `itemdata it = Game->LoadItemData(I_HINTBELL);`
Is it enough to just confirm the player has the item?  What does it need to load?

It loads bell`s item data into buffer. This command is needed to gain access to pointer to sound ID (Use Sound in ZQ) to play, when hint bell rings.

So what would happen if that line wasn't there?   I'd assume Hero->Item[193] would work, and Game->PlaySound(15); would work anyway.  Most people understand Item IDs and Sound Effect IDs.
They're made very obvious right there in the Item Editor and SFX Editor.
... I'm not sure why I'm even making any kind of argument about this.  o.O  Sorry.

Hardcoding to specific sound ID and item ID is not good. Hence used vars.
