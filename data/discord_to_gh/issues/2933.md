I recall there being a similar issue with combo scripts doing this when the combo changes. Surprised somehow nobody has caught this. In the example file, when writing to the weapon's script, it seemingly resumes the new script wherever the old one was running, likely causing very buggy effects. Doing the same with FFC scripts does not have this issue. Wondering how many 2.55 script types have this flaw though...

FFC scripts:
```            if(BC::checkFFC(ri->ffcref, "ffc->Script") == SH::_NoError)
            {
                tmpscr->ffcs[ri->ffcref].script = vbound(value/10000, 0, NUMSCRIPTFFC-1);
                if ( get_qr(qr_CLEARINITDONSCRIPTCHANGE))
                {
                    for(int32_t i=0; i<2; i++)
                        tmpscr->ffcs[ri->ffcref].inita[i] = 0;
                    
                    for(int32_t i=0; i<8; i++)
                        tmpscr->ffcs[ri->ffcref].initd[i] = 0;
                }
                for(int32_t i=0; i<16; i++)
                    ffmisc[ri->ffcref][i] = 0;
                
                auto& data = get_script_engine_data(ScriptType::FFC, ri->ffcref);
                data.ref.Clear();
                data.initialized = false;
                FFScript::deallocateAllScriptOwned(ScriptType::FFC, ri->ffcref);
            }```
EWeapon:
```        case EWPNSCRIPT:
            if(0!=(s=checkEWpn(ri->ewpn,"Script")))
            {
                FFScript::deallocateAllScriptOwned(ScriptType::Ewpn, ri->ewpn);
                (((weapon*)(s))->weaponscript)=vbound(value/10000,0,NUMSCRIPTWEAPONS-1);
                if ( get_qr(qr_CLEARINITDONSCRIPTCHANGE))
                {
                    for(int32_t q=0; q<8; q++)
                        (((weapon*)(s))->weap_initd[q]) = 0;
                }
            }
            break;```
I'm assuming the lack of data.ref.Clear() is the cause? In which case none of the script types aside from FFC seem to actually do this. Perhaps Zoria overlooked it when adding the first new script types and Emily copied his code on every subsequent addition?

script_engine_data is new connor stuff anyway, not sure what this used to look like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/26/2023 16:27

note that the only scripts I've added were the active/passive/onmap dmap slots, and generics
and some global slots
and newly subscreens
but the rest were all zoria's additions

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 00:51

It never cleared ref info, even before script_engine_data.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 00:52

100% broken when changing script w/o clearing refinfo, right? so no qr rule needed?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 00:54

Yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:03

`DMAPDATAPSUBSCRIPT` is too confusing for me, I am going to skip that.
everything else should be handled now, let's see what CI thinks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 02:07

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "`DMAPDATAPSUBSCRIPT` is too c…"): should be almost identical to DMAPSCRIPT?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:07

its too different. I dont want to think about it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 02:11

hm. Offhand I don't see why it would be different at all....

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:18

@ Moosh if printing SECOND now after grabbing sword, is your script working as intended now?

=== @ Moosh 01/07/2024 03:23

It should print RUNNING SECOND after ASSIGNING SECOND and then print a bunch of SECOND after that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 03:24

It should work on main now.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/17/2024 17:21

@ Moosh considering this fixed but lmk if you find otherwise
