I'm getting confused a bit and it'd be faster to have a button to teleport to next combo location, but it'd have to be accessable somewhere on the UI for fast references

?
Like, to scroll automatically to a combo in ZQ?
You, uh, can do that
Right click->Scroll to combo
Or like, do you mean cycling?
Needs more details for me to even understand what you're asking for

=== @ Deleted User 04/08/2022 12:05

Uhh like you know when you right click on a combo and search up combo location
it'd be nice to have a quick jump button to shoot to the tiles with a outline

you can open the tile or combo page from this menu

...this is a quest report text.
To add that to this would be a major major overhaul

=== @ Deleted User 04/08/2022 12:09

Ah okay XD sorry i just wanted to make things more efficient
still takes me a while to find things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 12:09

it gives you the map and screen, and you can `goto map`

so, it shouldn't be that bad to navigate to it
