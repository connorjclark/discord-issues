Add the ability to upscale/downscale tiles/tile groups. This would basically "zoom in" or "zoom out" a tile.
Ex:

a 2x upscale would go left-to-right, a 2x downscale would go right-to-left.
X/Y could be scaled separately, so, turning a 1x1 into a 2x4 should be doable
downscaling will lose resolution, so it will not be guaranteed to work well in all cases, but will make best-effort.
Of course, upscaling a group should be simple enough, though it must be integer-scaled
so a 2x2 start cannot become a 2x3, as that's a 1.5 X scale factor
but a 2x2 could become 2x4, 2x6, 4x4, 4x6, etc
downscaling similarly must be integer-divisor
this will need to handle warnings for tile overwrite protection on upscaling, as it will flood out into new tiles

Err, finished this, with decimal scaling, because fucking `stretch_blit` exists inherently in allegro and I'm a smart girl.
