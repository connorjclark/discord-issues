Attempting to use a purely vertical slope that can be passed through from just the right as a one-way wall, this does not work, instead allowing you to pass through from both sides.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) - are you alright with us doing 2.55 "official" w/o the slope bugs being fixed?

I'd rather it be fixed; so I'll probably look at it soon

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) is this something your recent commit I merged fixed?
