Just as it says, you could press ESC instead of clicking on the player window to pause it and bring up the options tab in File Select in prior versions.

Seems to work... if you MASH Esc for a minute, that is. Something keyboard input here is definitely fucky... @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

It's weird that it sort of works, but only by mashing. It's like it's not in focus or doesn't think pressing ESC should do anything, but mashing it makes it regain focus / think it should do something?

Fixed in next nightly.

This had broke because I added ESC for canceling Copy/Delete modes in the title screen (which could also be done by pressing the secondary button, but ESC seems more natural to cancel). The input handling for ESC in title and the System menu were conflicting.
