I guess I shouldn't be surprised by this one.
```class foo{
    int arr[32];
}

class bar{
    int arr2[4];
    
    int TheBadThing(foo f){
        return f->arr[arr2[0]];
    }
}```

oh *whyyyy*

....whaaat the fuck
there's some cursed shit at play here

=== @ Moosh 01/31/2023 12:59

Yeah I kinda assumed as much. I was doing some cursed shit to begin with to stumble onto this one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2023 12:59

So, it's uh
completely ignoring everything inside the `[]` in the semantic pass
which then leads to null pointer later
...looks like a "My stupid" as the cause?

....that ended up being a lot more confusing, but a lot smaller of a fix, than I thought
