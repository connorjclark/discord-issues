Hi. Not sure how feasible this is, but allowing Block All combos to function when placed on layers greater than 0 would be helpful.

There are some current workarounds to this limitation, but having to allocate triggers to blocking and destroying weapons means losing out on the potential functionality that arises from Block All working alongside those triggers.

(replying to @ Matthew "Hi. Not sure how feasible thi…"): Block All combos are outdated
and, the triggers can work alongside
you can have it destroy the weapon AND do other stuff
or if you want the block all to be NOT triggered by the weapon, and want some OTHER trigger to do stuff
you can use `Weapon Separate Triggers`
which will make the weapon only get destroyed, and be separate from the other types of triggers

I'll have to look more into Weapon Separate Triggers then

basically, if `Weapon Separate Triggers` is checked here
then a weapon or eweapon triggering the combo will ONLY do the checkboxes inside the `Weapon` box here

=== @ Matthew 01/30/2024 00:15

So, are certain combo types deprecated moving forward? And kept in for compatibility?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 00:16

useful both for killing, and for torches that light arrows and such

=== @ Matthew 01/30/2024 00:16

That's perfect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 00:16

(replying to @ Matthew "So, are certain combo types d…"): basically. Block All is unlikely to ever get new features.
It works in a TOTALLY jank way like most old combos did
which, triggers here legit replace ALL of the `Block` types lol

=== @ Matthew 01/30/2024 00:17

Does Ignite Weapon mean that, say, I shoot an arrow through a torch and the arrow is considered "on fire" and can ignite things triggered by flame?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 00:17

(There's also `Block Weapon (Custom)`, which was designed to work with triggers earlier on... but then we just added `Kill Triggering Weapon` as an option in triggers, which immediately made that outdated...)
(replying to @ Matthew "Does Ignite Weapon mean that,…"): Yep yep!
Note that fire has been changed entirely in how it works from previous versions

=== @ Matthew 01/30/2024 00:17

That's awesome omg

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 00:18

It has been *neatly* divided into 4 categories: `Any Fire`, `Strong Fire`, `Magic Fire`, `Divine Fire`
and in the item editor for the candle, book, Divine Fire (new name for Din's Fire), or Boomerang (re: fire boomerang being able to be on fire)
you can set which of the fire types that will be
(clasically, `Any` = `Blue`, `Strong` = `Red`, `Magic` = `Book`, `Divine` = `Din's`
Then, here, you can ignite the weapon with any of those fire types
to make ANY weapon have the properties
and ADDITIONALLY

You can set up Burning sprites in the item editor for any item
which will automatically change the weapon's sprite when it has it's ignition state changed
AND can change it's Light Radius as well!
(re: new dark rooms)
So, basically, this system is designed to work super well and customly for whatever you need

=== @ Matthew 01/30/2024 00:35

I feel like every day, I learn something new about the combo editor
& I had no idea that the item editor had modifications that would tie into the combos
Thanks for the thorough response Emily. I might just need to pick your brain for combo-related advice moving forward rather than making more requests.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 00:37

(replying to @ Matthew "Thanks for the thorough respo…"): yep yep, #deleted-channel exists for a reason, perfect place to ask whatever!

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/30/2024 09:56

In your opinion, would it be worth adding to the [?] descriptor of the Block All/Sword (etc) combos that these combos are just for backwards compatibility, and the better solution is to work with the blocking things on that tab?
You give phenomenal advice and super-useful insights, Emily, and it would be a shame if they were only visible in the individual visible areas of Discord where they're offered, rather than globally in the very program being used that would raise those questions.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 09:58

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "In your opinion, would it be…"): #2780 add to the list
