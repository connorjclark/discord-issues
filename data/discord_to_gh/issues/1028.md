Finished looking over ZQuest, only a couple things in the GUIs stood out as out of place:
```-Pickup flags in the item editor still has that big honkin' checkbox next to it
-SFX menu flickers when pressing the play button sometimes
-Background bezel on the side warp menu is mis-sized```
Here's what side warp triggers look like now

vs how it used to be

I imagine this is the same thing that happened with the rectangles in init data

=== @ Moosh 09/18/2021 01:19

here's a snap of the play button flicker in action. Harmless but a little off. I'm really reaching to find anything in the editor that's immediately obviously broken, which is good

(replying to @ Moosh "Here's what side warp trigger…"): Similar bug in CSets

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 02:01

(replying to @ Moosh "Here's what side warp trigger…"): ok, so this happens in exactly 2 places
and has no explaination
fun
@ Saffith should probably be in this thread

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 02:02

... That is very random and weird.

=== @ Moosh 09/18/2021 02:03

Oh! It is in the CSets menu as well. Thanks for catching vlamart

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 02:04

ok, 3 places
but it wasn't occurring in every place
and it also wasn't occurring in ZC's menus

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 02:06

like, check the control binding menus

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 02:09

Also View -> View Palette

see how this menu isn't fucked up
makes me so confused

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:27

I think it's affecting every `jwin_frame_proc` in ZQuest, and some are just more obvious than others.
Windows

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 03:27

oh, it's also affecting the textbox there
huh

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:28

That's not a textbox. It's just a frame with text inside.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 03:28

the `Music.nsf` box?

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:28

Yep.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 03:28

huh
that makes sense then
but I know I opened some places that use frame and didn't see it

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:30

Are you sure it was in ZQuest? ZC seems to be unaffected.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 03:33

I could swear at least 2 spots in zq had no issue
but could have just been non-noticable
so, it's only in ZQ, and only in large mode
that points to `zq_custom.cpp` `large_dialog()`

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 03:36

Hm... The secret combos dialog looks weirdly okay.
Nothing's off by even a pixel.
`large_dialog(secret_dlg,1.75);`
... Is 1.75 okay, but 1.5 isn't?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 03:38

hmm, that's odd

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 23:54

Okay, seriously, WTF.
I found the problem.
```
if (jwin_frame_proc == d_comboframe_proc)
        std::cout << "Yep, they're the same" << std::endl;
```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 23:55

wh-what

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 23:55

The functions are identical, so I guess it just combined them...
Not sure why that's allowed.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 23:55

C++ what the shit is this
```cpp
// Identical to jwin_frame_proc, but is treated differently by large_dialog()
int d_comboframe_proc(int msg, DIALOG *d, int c)```
fucking
wtf

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 23:57

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2015/february/compilers-what-every-programmer-should-know-about-compiler-optimizations
Also, by specifying the /OPT:ICF switch, the linker will fold identical functions and global constant variables.
So I guess that's enabled somehow.

=== @ Saffith 09/19/2021 00:01

Project > Properties, Configuration Properties > Linker > Optimization, set "Enable COMDAT Folding" to false, and it's fixed.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:01

now time to figure out how to do that in cmake

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:03

need to set `/OPT:NOICF` switch

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:08

success

=== @ Saffith 09/19/2021 00:09

Excellent.
So there are breaking optimizations enabled automatically, huh...
Not any more of those, hopefully.

woo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:16

(replying to @ Moosh "here's a snap of the play but…"): this only seems to occur if you click the button really fast?
Methinks allegro issue
processing the mouse click before the first `draw` command of the dialog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:19

(keep in mind most buttons that do special code are actually closing the entire dialog, and then re-opening it almost instantly)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:21

. . . and I had one idea for something that might fix it, which promptly failed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:24

gonna call that one `acceptable graphical issue`, considering it seems you really need to spam click to make it happen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:33

and finally

no more honkin' checkbox
or any of the other crap there that should have been removed when @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) added the `Pickup Flags` tab
....should probably shift the `String:` stuff left....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:36

god fucking dammit
I keep pressing `F7` expecting it to build
but in MSVC2019 the shortcut is `Ctrl+Shift+B` instead..... 🤢

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:38

ah, thank god that's rebindable

...plenty of space in the lower-right if we need to add more stuff.
@ Moosh this all seem good?
