A generic script type

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:03

@ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:04

So yeah, this one sounds awesome
Are these going to support multiple running at once or only one at a time?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:05

For the 'freezing everything', only one will run at a time while frozen

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:05

That makes sense of course

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:05

for passively running without freezing, as many as you like

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:05

There's gotta be an upper bound doesn't there? Still super exciting
This'll revolutionize how global scripts are written
...and possibly turn some quests script structures into a hot garbage spaghetti mess. But that's always a risk we take

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:09

(replying to @ Moosh "There's gotta be an upper bou…"): howevermany slots there are to assign to
each slot will be able to run one instance

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:09

Ohhh that makes a lot of sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:09

probably 512
similar to ffcs
then it'd be like

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:10

So once again I imagine these'd be used similarly to how we use functions in a global script. Just a bit cleaner for certain applications

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:11

`Game->RunGenericScript(int index, int flags)` probably
where `flags` would include
`Reset on continue`
`Reset on exit`
`Frozen Run`

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:11

My global script could in  theory just become a bunch of calls to that function in order and then quit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:11

and anything elsse to be thought of
If a script "resets on continue", then it will not run again after F6->Continue unless you run it again
if it "resets on exit", same, but for exiting to title
and "frozen run" being obvious

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:16

So where will these fit into script timing? My gut would say after all other script types so any type of script can take run one on the same frame

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:17

If you do a frozen run, it will run immediately

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:17

Splendid

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:20

(replying to @ Moosh "So where will these fit into…"): Though thinking further on this, the way item and lweapon scripts run after Link.animate() has caused me some grief in the past.
Would like to avoid that pitfall again if possible

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:25

So I guess before hitBy clearing and Link.animate() would make sense. That way they can affect player inputs and read collision stuff

=== @ Moosh 04/19/2022 05:30

Anyways, thanks for fielding all my questions here. I'll definitely wanna help test this one when you've got builds for it 🙂

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 05:32

It'll be a bit, this will take a lot of energy to work on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 10:38

Built some basic framework
but that's all I'm getting done without sleep

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 20:54

GUI exists here
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/965839714219347978/966079397482352650/unknown.png?ex=65e7868d&is=65d5118d&hm=d6afad9e2f017435ae12acc8398d74f5f4e1de767a9786f3867a93fec51d3d84&)
which took FAR more fucking work than you would think
turns out there was a bug with tabpanels
where when clicking the arrows it wasn't using the right font for width calculations
and sometimes would never allow you to scroll to the final tab
which is FUN
...apparently I inadvertantly fixed that for new GUI system already

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 21:11

uhh, I have a script compiled and in a slot
that felt too easy, like I must have forgotten a step somewhere, and it bothers me
but, it could just be because there's no `this->`
at least, yet
I actually will probably add a datatype for managing generic scripts, and giving you that as the `this` would make sense then, so I'll add that later
also @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) might want to be in the thread

I set a hardcoded test to run slot 1 as a frozen script
and it worked beautifully
now I just need to do the whole "adding new zscript functions" part, and the 'passive generic scripts' part, which is gonna be fancy as hell
Oh, also, in a FROZEN generic script, `Waitdraw()` does *nothing*. By nothing, I mean it does not even act as a `Waitframe()`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 23:05

Oh my
I appear to have frozen scripts working VERY nicely

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 23:26

now just to link up the `this` pointer...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2022 23:59

@ Moosh want a preview?

=== @ Moosh 04/20/2022 00:00

Dang, already?
Hit me up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 00:00

only the frozen mode, no passive run

Ah that makes sense

HOW DOES THAT LOOK?
WOO

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 06:08

```cpp
#include "std.zh"

generic script Bar
{
    void run()
    {
        char32 buf[256];
        while(true)
        {
            for(int q = 0; q < SCR_NUM_TIMINGS; ++q)
            {
                WaitTo(q,false);
                unless(q) printf("--START OF FRAME--\n");
                getScrTimeName(buf,q);
                printf("Timing %s\n", buf);
            }
        }
    }
}

global script Active
{
    void run()
    {
        until(Hero->PressA) Waitframe();
        Waitframe();
        //genericdata foo = Game->LoadGenericData(1);

            Trace(2);
            Waitframe();

}
```
Loops through each timing, printing out a message for every single one
*extremely* fine control

bool RunFrozen();
 * Attempts to run the given generic script in frozen mode.
 * Returns true if successful, false otherwise.

bool Running;
 * Reads as whether or not the script is currently running passively
 * If written to false, kills the script
 * If written to true, launches (or restarts) the script```and in Game->```cpp
genericdata LoadGenericData(int scriptslot);
 * Loads the 'genericdata' pointer referencing the specified generic script slot.

Usable only in passively-running generic scripts:```cpp
void WaitTo(int script_timing, bool at_least);
 * Only for passively-running 'Generic Scripts'
 * Waits until the specified timing.
 * If 'at_least' is true, any later timing will also end the wait.

 * !WIP! Timings are subject to change```

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/20/2022 16:13

Most recent nightly being the one I just posted this morning?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 16:14

feedback on:
-anything generally to do with the feature
-More slots? Less slots? there's 512 now
-Are the available `WaitTo` timings useful, do they work, are there any more we should add?
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Most recent nightly being the…"): yes, I just pulled, merged to update my branch, and built clean
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 16:16

...I was thinking about pinging `Testers`, but then I asked the simple question of how many Testers are also Scripters? The answer is apparently 2, and both are already in this thread lol
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 21:49

```
int ExitState;
 * An 'exit state' representing at what point the script will automatically
 *     stop running passively. Use the 'GENSCR_EXIT_' constants from 'std_constants.zh'.
 * GENSCR_EXIT_NEVER: Never automatically stops, if running when quest exits
 *                    it will be running upon reload as well.
 * GENSCR_EXIT_RELOAD: Upon exiting to the save select screen, 'Running' becomes 'false'.
 * GENSCR_EXIT_CONTINUE: Same as RELOAD, but also stops running upon 'F6->Continue' or similar.

int DataSize;
 * Represents the size of the 'Data[]' array.
 * Read/Write, result saves to the save file.
 * If written larger than current size, 'new' space will be zeroed out.
 * Default 0, range 0-214748.

untyped Data[DataSize];
 * An array of variable size, settable in 'DataSize' above.
 * This data is saved to the save file.
 * Attempting to access any index '>= DataSize' results in an error.

untyped InitD[8];
 * Access to the InitD[] for this script slot

all seems to be working just fine!

a script that only prints *some* timings, using the `Data[]` to keep track of which

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/20/2022 22:04

I'd test this but I have like zero imagination

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 22:05

really the main feedback I'll end up needing is if any specific timings are missing from the list that would be useful
I think all the functionality part of this just *works*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 22:07

I switched the loading bar script to use `InitD[]` for it's values

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 22:18

Now it's time to get fancier
because I feel the need

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 22:45

soooo
```
int ExitState;
 * An 'exit state' representing at what point the script will automatically
 *     stop running passively. Use the 'GENSCR_EXIT_' constants from 'std_constants.zh'.
 * GENSCR_EXIT_NEVER: Never automatically stops, if running when quest exits
 *                    it will be running upon reload as well.
 * GENSCR_EXIT_RELOAD: Upon exiting to the save select screen, 'Running' becomes 'false'.
 * GENSCR_EXIT_CONTINUE: Same as RELOAD, but also stops running upon 'F6->Continue' or similar.```
This was nice
it let you quit the script on `F6->Continue`, or on reloading
...buuuuut I can do better!
```
bool ExitState[GENSCR_NUMST];
 * An array of exit states. Each exit state, if true, specifies a condition for the script
 *     to stop running passively. Use the 'GENSCR_EXIT_' constants from 'std_constants.zh'.

bool ReloadState[GENSCR_NUMST];
 * An array of reload states. Each reload state, if true, specifies a condition for the script
 *     to exit and relaunch if running. Use the 'GENSCR_EXIT_' constants from 'std_constants.zh'.
 * GENSCR_ST_RELOAD: Exits/Reloads upon exiting to the save select screen.
 * GENSCR_ST_CONTINUE: Exits/Reloads upon 'F6->Continue' or similar.
 * GENSCR_ST_CHANGE_SCREEN: Exits/Reloads upon loading a new screen
 * GENSCR_ST_CHANGE_DMAP: Exits/Reloads upon loading a new dmap
 * GENSCR_ST_CHANGE_LEVEL: Exits/Reloads upon loading a new dmap level```
You want the script to exit when you change screens?
Or just reboot when you change screens and run from the start?
Or DMap, or Level instead of screens
There are 5 states defined here, but I have space for that to become 16 without needing to change save format

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 22:55

so
```cpp
generic script screen_script
{
    void run()
    {
        printf("Map,Screen (%d,%X) entered!\n", Game->GetCurMap(), Game->GetCurScreen());
        while(true) Waitframe();
    }
}

global script Init
{
    void run()
    {
        genericdata screen_scr = Game->LoadGenericData(3);
        screen_scr->ReloadState[GENSCR_ST_CHANGE_SCREEN] = true;
        screen_scr->Running = true;
    }
}```
This, in theory, should run the `printf` line once per screen as soon as you change screens
set in `Init`, that doesn't need to run more than once per save to make it PERMANENTLY run forever
Now, to think of other uses....
Imagine a scripted status effect that grants you some duration of enemies spawning with half HP

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 22:59

err, let's make this easier, it also halves their HP when you use it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 23:01

```cpp
generic script half_hp_spawn
{
    void wait(genericdata this)
    {
        if(this->InitD[0] > 0) --this->InitD[0];
        Waitframe();
    }
    void run()
    {
        this->ReloadState[GENSCR_ST_CHANGE_SCREEN] = true;
        unless(this->InitD[0]) return;
        until(EnemiesAlive()) wait();
        unless(this->InitD[0]) return;
        for(int q = 1; q < Screen->NumNPCs(); ++q)
            Screen->LoadNPC(q)->HP /= 2;
        while(true) wait();
    }
}```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 23:04

Here you go
run that
it'll count down it's `InitD[0]` as a timer
if it hits 0, the script will stop running
if enemies are alive and it is still running, it halves all of their HP
then it waits *until you change screens*, and starts over again, so it repeats the effect each screen until the duration runs out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 23:08

the real point being, anything where you want it to reset each screen/dmap/level should be easier to do with this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2022 23:26

The script gets the screen change memo earlier than the event log, it seems

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 00:47

Oh, seems there's no Game->GetGenericScript() function.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 00:48

didn't add that yet

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 00:54

@ Moosh building again now

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 00:55

Ah okay. I don't especially need it for what I'm doing, just making sure you knew

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 00:56

this build will also have all the other stuff since the last one I posted
like InitD

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 00:59

Do I need to WaitTo() to a certain time in order for the script to draw things?
```generic script ScreenFilter{
    void run(){
        bitmap b = Game->CreateBitmap(256, 176);
        b->Own();
        bitmap b2 = Game->CreateBitmap(256, 176);
        b2->Own();
        while(true){
            //WaitTo(SCR_TIMING_END_FRAME, true);
            
            b->Clear(0);
            b->BlitTo(0, RT_SCREEN, 0, 56, 256, 176, 0, 0, 256, 176, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false);
            b2->Clear(0);
            b2->BlitTo(0, RT_SCREEN, 0, 56, 256, 176, 0, 0, 256, 176, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false);
            int xOff = Link->InputMouseX-8;
            int yOff = Link->InputMouseY-88;
            b2->Blit(0, b, xOff, 0, 16, 176, xOff, yOff, 16, 176, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false);
            if(yOff<0)
                b2->Blit(0, b, xOff, 0, 16, 176, xOff, yOff+176, 16, 176, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false);
            else if(yOff>0)
                b2->Blit(0, b, xOff, 0, 16, 176, xOff, yOff-176, 16, 176, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false);
            b->Blit(6, RT_SCREEN, 0, 0, 256, 176, 0, 0, 256, 176, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false);
            
            Screen->Rectangle(6, xOff, -1, xOff+15, 176, 0x81, 1, 0, 0, 0, false, 128);
            Screen->Line(6, xOff, yOff, xOff+15, yOff, 0x81, 1, 0, 0, 0, 128);
            printf("I EXIST\n");
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
The I EXIST is printing here, but the rectangle and line directly above aren't drawing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:01

the script draws are cleared after the start of the frame
`SCR_TIMING_POST_DRAW_CLEAR` would be the waitto point

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:02

Okay so that seems a little inconvenient...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:02

So, there's the start of the frame, then combo animation, then `Input` is updated, then script draws clear
it DOES seem a bit inconvenient
let me change that if I can

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:10

uhg
I can fix it for normal frames
but script draws don't clear normally during scrolling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:16

think I've got it

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:20

I'm having a real hell of a time with these draw timings

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:21

Seems nothing but the screen itself is drawing until after SCR_TIMING_PRE_DRAW. But then on SCR_TIMING_POST_DRAW, BlitTo() doesn't draw the screen at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:24

if you are post draw, your blit to won't run until the next frame
you need to do everything, including the blitto, pre-draw
you just need to do the blitto on a higher layer

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:25

So there's no timing where I can draw the contents of the screen to a bitmap
Oh
OH!
We even talked about this and I went and fucking forgot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:25

yep

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:25

god I feel dumb

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:25

it's layer based, like any other draw; the generic script timing is unrelated
`SCR_TIMING_PRE_DRAW` means that you can still queue draws for that frame
and, all script 'waitdraw's have been completed
`SCR_TIMING_WAITDRAW` means it is right BEFORE other scripts waitdraws
`SCR_TIMING_POST_DRAW` means all draws are already done for the frame
from `POST_DRAW` until draws are cleared, no script draws do anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:28

`SCR_TIMING_POST_DRAW_CLEAR` is about to no longer exist
now it should clear before `START_FRAME`
#deleted-channel @here

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:29

makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:29

`Waitframe()` waits until the next frame's `START_FRAME`
the only difference between `Waitframe()` and `WaitTo(SCR_TIMING_START_FRAME, false)` is that the latter won't wait until the next frame if it is currently the start of the frame

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:30

So now my effect is working and it's pretty cool, but there seems to be a little oddity going on during scrolling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:30

Scrolling is fun
Generally, try doing draws after `SCR_TIMING_WAITDRAW`
scrolling might be better in the new build anyway though
had to reorganize something

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:34

ohh
uhhhh
if you made this a global script, does it have the same issue?
because this could be `BlitTo` or it could be generic scripts/timing

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:35

Could this work as a global script?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:35

I don't see why not
also, are you using `Game->Scrolling[]` for offsets?

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:36

I guess yeah it shouldn't be an issue. Main reason I was using generic script is that way I can time it to run after all other script types so it'll capture their draws

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:36

yeah, that is the nice thing

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:37

Aaaaand yup, it doesn't happen in the global script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:37

oh fun

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:37

Lemme grab that new build and see if it fixes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:37

what `WaitTo` timing were you doing it at?
oh, yeah, do that first

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:40

Oh! I don't think it was the script type at all. It's the `fast dungeon scrolling` rule

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:41

oh??

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:41

and since I don't give a shit about NES behavior...I don't give a shit about NES behavior 😎

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:41

Are you using `Game->Scrolling[]` to detect scrolling?
that should account for any and all QRs

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:41

No, I'm just drawing the screen to a bitmap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:41

oh, you aren't doing anything to handle scrolling and the qr still did bad?

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:42

So all scrolling effects should come directly from what the engine is doing
Yup, no extra calcs for scrolling
I'm assuming there's some jank with however it's freezing the screen drawing during that pause
actually...hold up...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:43

what `WaitTo` timing are you drawing at?

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:43

Does dungeon scrolling have some kind of data overlap with InputMouseY?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:43

? ? ? ? ? ?

Here's just the whole script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:44

you could do `SCR_TIMING_PRE_DRAW` for `right before draw happens`
though that actually occurs DIRECTLY after the one you are using

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:45

`SCR_TIMING_PRE_DRAW` stopped working after I updated builds

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:45

Did you recompile?

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:45

yeah
Oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:45

Did you regrab std_zh?

OH WAIT I'M AN IDIOT
🤦 🤦 🤦 🤦 🤦

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:45

given that a constant was removed, std_constants changed

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:46

I remembered what you updated in std and somehow did not remember _that_ you updated std

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:47

XD
good job

=== @ Moosh 04/21/2022 01:47

Anyways, those red lines during the freeze. those are being drawn to the _screen,_ not the bitmap
And they're based on InputMouseY

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 01:53

I took your script
and compiled it in my quest
and it works fine
so with default QRs it's fine

Yeah it's specically slow dungeon scrolling

It looks like it's drawing with a bad Y

huh, something isn't clearing script draw commands

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 03:02

There's a timing issue
that's running 2 frames worth of generic scripts in only 1 frame of actual time

All of this just from that one rule?
Strange

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 03:07

it wasn't all just 1 rule
it was my fixes to my fixes to my fixes to the 1 rule

warps are also weird

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2022 05:32

OK so
fuck warps
fuck warps very much
nope
generic scripts don't run during warps
scrolling is fine
warps are nope

2 hours
trying to get warps to fucking work
to no avail
even with hacky shit
so, yeah, it's just beyond doable
but, I did clean it up so it doesn't TRY to run during warps either now
