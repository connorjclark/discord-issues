When warping from one DMap to another, with the same Passive Subscreen Script on both, scripted draws start going funky.

Screenshot 1: When entering a warp, the Passive Subscreen script fails to clear the previous draw before making the new one as can be shown by the buggy counter draw right below the subscreen. If this occurs after Waitdraw, this occurs after the screen on the next map is loaded in.

Screenshot 2: Specifically during the opening wipe when entering the DMap, the tile draws that correspond to the DMap title for the previous DMap do not get cleared when the one for the current DMap is drawn.

This occurs on the newest nightly.
