4*4 is sometimes not enough for ghosted enemies and certain scripts.

What's the limit for the new resizable normal combos?

"Resizable normal combos"?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/24/2021 23:13

i thought some combos now had a size field
such as armos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 23:22

oh, think Zoria did that
I have no clue what the limit is
but, it's entirely separate code, entirely unrelated to ffcs

=== @ P-Tux7 10/24/2021 23:26

yeah i was asking because whatever limit was efficient there, might apply here as well

so uhhhhhh
fun times
An FFC's `TileWidth` and `EffectWidth` are crammed into a single variable as bitwise
so there *literally is not any more room* in the variable
and, expanding FFC's variables by *anything* is a ***MASSIVE*** memory and .qst size cost
