Using the latest nightly, but this has been present since alpha 111.
Basically, start a quest on a Dmap with MIDI music. Reset ZC, go to that save file again, and if you continued on a Dmap with a MIDI, the game will start playing the *middle* part of the MIDI instead of the beginning. A few intruments also go missing.

I couldn't reproduce this. Please provide a quest file.

Still an issue?

bump @ Tabletpillow ?

I think this still happens on my end. Might have been an allegro issue though.

Closing, let us know if you see it again.
