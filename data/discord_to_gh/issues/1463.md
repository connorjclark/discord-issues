I have reported the following bugs and oddities with Constant Item Scripts:
-> If an item running a Constant Item script is removed, the script is not terminated. Emily confirms this is a bug here: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/878114935396257852/952594737771204690
-> Related to the above, if a Constant Item script is terminated and the item is removed and acquired again, the Constant Item script does not run again. Also feels buggy.
-> Constant Item scripts play even if the player has acquired a higher level version of the same item running the same script. Doesn't seem buggy but it feels odd.

The third one is fine, if acquired level version of the same item has "Keep lower level items" option turned on.

(replying to @ Alucard648 "The third one is fine, if acq…"): So, uhh, "Keep Lower Level Items" has been broken since the item editor was added
it *always* acted like it was on, even when it was off
Bug 1 was a Zoria bug in the implementation of them running
Bug 2 was not as stated; the issue was that gaining items via Cheats or SCCs was not initializing the passive item script
'Bug' 3 is a bit odd, so there's now a new QR for that.
