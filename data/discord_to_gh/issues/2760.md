See videos, basically Link will not animate when swimming up, or while floating while facing up.

I don't want to be a bother, and I'm not sure the stance on bumping. This is my very subtle bump. I know this is a very minor thing though.

=== @ Anthus 11/22/2023 05:26

As of 119 this still seems to be a thing.

=== @ Attempt 11/22/2023 11:43

what animation style are you on?

=== @ Attempt 11/22/2023 11:59

ahh it seems to only happen with the original animation style

Does not appear to be a bug
the up-facing direction flips horizontally instead of using a second tile
...so, err, I suppose the bug is that the preview in ZQ is inaccurate

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2023 03:04

this also isn't just the case for swimming; appears to also be the case for up-facing while charging  a spin attack, sideview-swimming, holding a lifted item, and walking
(meta) thread name was changed: ZQ up-facing player sprites in original style preview wrongly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2023 03:06

@ DeletedUser So either you would want to use a horizontally-flipping sprite, or change animation styles to a less janky one.

=== @ Attempt 11/24/2023 03:10

ahh
an nes thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2023 03:10

yep, hardcoded NES jank.
I really wanna just rewrite player sprites at some point to be like, more configurable... but that sounds like a task probably close-ish to subscreen rewrite complexity, soo

=== @ Attempt 11/24/2023 03:17

oooo
it could be altered to an "nes fix" request to make the up sprites 2 frame

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2023 03:18

eh, that's one small thing to change for one sprite style
what I'd really like is to, like, let you customize each animation
something similar to how the subscreen transitions work, where you can pick types with different options
because then you could have a standard N-frame animation (just pick a start tile, number of frames, and maybe a rate?)
or a 'customizable' animation where you can pick each tile, for things like the BS that repeat a tile
...there are some things that get in the way though, like, the pitfall animation is 70 frames long no matter what, so you can't make it longer than that (shorter works by adding an invisible frame at the end)
since, that's like, how long it takes to fall before you respawn
and the lifting sprites speed is based on the combo you're lifting
(you already can set number of frames for those, though)
and hammering while sideview swimming has a y-offset
so, I'd need to:
- design a brand new animation system here
- make it work compat wise with all old animation styles
- handle special cases like falling, side-swim-pounding, lifting
compat also needs to work for scripts (can they change the animation style? if so...)
...this is definitely something we should do though.

=== @ Attempt 11/24/2023 03:27

interesting idea

=== @ Anthus 11/24/2023 04:48

Nah if you watch the videos the up swimming sprite does have unique frames in the preview. It's set up the same as the other directions and it's the only one that does this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2023 04:51

(replying to @ Anthus "Nah if you watch the videos t…"): yeah, the preview is wrong, that's the bug
up direction in original animation style uses horizontal flip, instead of a second frame
(we've had SO many bugs with the ZQ preview of player animations not matching the in-game one... this system is absolute jank crap)

=== @ Anthus 11/24/2023 07:56

it's not just the preview though, this is how the tiles are in the quest:

when link swims up, he simply does not animate, in game
these are the rules I have checked related to movement

the other three directions work fine, both in game, and in the preview. I can upload the qst file if you'd like to see it

=== @ Anthus 11/24/2023 08:06

there's also another semi-related swimming bug where link can jump from the water while swimming, if roc's feather is on an Ex button
also reported it, but I can't find it in the list

=== @ Attempt 11/24/2023 10:27

(replying to @ Anthus "when link swims up, he simply…"): again, this is intentional
because the up sprite isn't two frame, it's one frame being flipped
and it looks like it isn't animating because that tile is symmetrical
that's what we're saying
in the original animation style for the player a lot of the up sprites are just flipping one tile, rather being two tiles

=== @ Attempt 11/24/2023 10:32

therefore this is being flipped, and since it's a symmetrical tile it only seems like it isn't animating

=== @ Attempt 11/24/2023 10:42

by shifting the tile to one side will show ya

=== @ Attempt 11/24/2023 10:45

and i *believe* this is the case because in the original z1, there was no reason not to have a second frame for moving up
because even with the shield there was no shield that showed on link in z1 while facing up bcuz they deemed it unnecessary, meaning they thought that having link have two frames while looking up were unnecessary  as well
the corners they cut in 1986

be wild

=== @ Anthus 11/24/2023 16:31

Oh, I see what you mean now

=== @ Anthus 11/24/2023 16:37

I was definitely misunderstanding the info here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2023 20:49

yep yep, it's a flip instead of a second tile for up-facing in the original anim style
so either use a different anim style, or use an animation that's a single tile flipping
(or wait god knows how long until I get around to the idea mentioned above of rewriting the damn entire system)

=== @ Anthus 11/24/2023 21:19

yeah I can work around it, I think, I will check other animation styles
it's also not a super critical bug
