I migrated from 2.55 alpha 114 to 2.55 alpha 118 and now it's not opening. It give the Invalid Quest File error.

SFX data is corrupted somehow
if you delete your ocarina SFX that you added and re-save it without those in 114, it will open fine in latest
....now, WHY that happened, I have no clue

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:16

how do I delete the sfx data? do I need 114?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:17

yes

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:17

oh ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:28

So, gonna leave this report open- while I did find a way to fix it, I have no idea what *caused* this

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:29

I reloaded the sfx, do you want me to post the After file?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:29

So, if you load the sfx back in 118, and you re-save it in 118, can you load it still?

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:30

uhh I tried to test the quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:30

err, that's not quite right
that's trying to load a folder
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "So, if you load the sfx back…"): just use zq
don't touch zc yet
does it load in zq

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:31

let me check
doesn't work
it showed a loading sfx...error before I pressed load as well when I opened up the program

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:31

aaahk
either something is bugged with our saving of sfx
or something is bugged with those particular sfx files
Can you supply the sfx files?
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) probably more in your ballpark here

why is Open-Ocarina 2:03 seconds long

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:33

...looks like that might be a corrupted wav file
even discord recognizes it
might be no bug on our end here then, aside from the fact that we failed to detect the file being corrupted and allowed it to corrupt the qst as well
(not sure why A114 was able to load this still....)

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:34

wait it's actually 2:03

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:34

. . .

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:34

why is it so long!?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:34

still might be corrupted
could have been lengthened because the download corrupted or something

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:35

I'm going to try trimming it and see if that helps any

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:35

2 questions:
1. If you use all 4 sfx that AREN'T that one, does it still bug out?
2. If the answer to 1 is 'no', then, if you edit and shorten this sfx and then try to load it, does that help?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/29/2023 01:37

The sfx section is def. buggy. It often corrupts when saving in Debug mode.

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:37

uuuuh I might need to roll this back in one of my backups

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:38

yeah, yeah you will
oof

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:40

Answer to question 1 is no

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:42

Answer to question 2 is Yes
so it doesn't seem to like long sfx's 🤔

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:44

Long SFX are generally bad anyway
I once saw someone who put in a bunch of long SFX
and when you hit start on the title screen to play their quest
it took ***multiple minutes to open the quest***

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:44

🤣

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 01:44

(and the size of their `.qst` was huge)
so, long sfx are generally quite a bad idea for many reasons

=== @ Seboops 09/29/2023 01:45

I think I forgot to reduce the measure count in my sfx
so it just had a bunch of emptyness
anyway I need to get going, thanks for the help!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/01/2023 20:13

In Debug builds, loading the default quest (File->New) and playing `21: Bomb Placed` SFX shows the issue: it is garbage data. Issue likely in the sfx loading code

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/01/2023 20:56

Issue was the SAMPLE structure uses `unsigned long`, but the data is written to those fields as if they are `dword` (half the length). the SAMPLE was not zero-initializied so these fields would have random data in their upper bits, resulting in "huge" sfx

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/01/2023 20:57

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Issue was the SAMPLE structur…"): ah, `unsigned long` was being assumed to be `dword`
that's a leftover change from upgrading to 64-bit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/01/2023 21:04

Letting it run in my fork's CI before pushing to main, but should be good now.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/01/2023 22:33

@ Seboops could you give the latest nightly a try?

=== @ Seboops 10/01/2023 23:02

not currently, I’ll try to remember to try tonight
the quest file is on the posted message if you want to try

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/01/2023 23:03

That's the initial 114 version ya?

=== @ Seboops 10/02/2023 02:07

I think?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 22:07

I'm pretty certain this is fixed now. I'll leave it open for @ Seboops to confirm - but no rush.

=== @ Seboops 10/07/2023 22:34

I’ll forget shortly if I don’t do it now

=== @ Seboops 10/07/2023 22:48

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) it still gives an error
same one

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 23:32

Are you reopening the original or a file you already saved in 118?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 23:36

The file uploaded above was saved in 118 nightly. The fix won't fix already corrupted files, but will prevent it from happening again.

=== @ Seboops 10/09/2023 00:48

it was the original one
