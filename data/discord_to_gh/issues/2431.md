It would be really great to have a save stating feature for testing , it is inefficient to developers to have to set up special warps for boss testing and it means the program must be reset each time you want to test something like a puzzle or balance an enemy room. It would presumably be placed behind level 4 cheats

How about "no", not in engine my god

...test mode already gives you plenty of help with testing quests
Save states would require so much work it's insane

=== @ donkey kong hockey 06/09/2023 00:45

why cant you reply in a polite manner like I sent the request in

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/09/2023 00:46

. . . My apologies.
Save states have been requested numerous times, this would be FAR too complicated a feature to add.

i do not appreciate the way you responded to me it was extremely rude.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/09/2023 00:47

sorry

=== @ donkey kong hockey 06/09/2023 00:47

thank you

Have you been using Test mode?
(replying to @ donkey kong hockey "It would be really great to h…"): test mode mostly removes the need for things like boss testing warps

=== @ donkey kong hockey 06/09/2023 00:50

sure thats true, but like constant room testing still requires a reset
and if its too much to program thats okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/09/2023 00:50

(replying to @ donkey kong hockey "sure thats true, but like con…"): ?
if you're just testing the same room F9 resets you right there

=== @ donkey kong hockey 06/09/2023 00:53

sure this works too
thats all you had to say

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/09/2023 01:02

I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for, but maybe test mode + recording a replay will help. There's an option on zquest launcher options to set that up.

(replying to @ donkey kong hockey "It would be really great to h…"): Unsure if this would be what you're looking for, but I wrote this script to save and load starting equipment in test play without having to screw up your init data:
