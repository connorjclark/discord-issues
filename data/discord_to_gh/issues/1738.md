Required:
-Screen stores guy enemy ID as integer (likely already done)
-Screen Guy selection dialog searches through quest enemy list (what I need help with)
-and dynamically lists all Guy-family enemies in the list (what I need help with)
luckily this shouldn't require touching guys.cpp...? i hope

is there any existing snippet of code that searches through a list (enemies, items, misc sprites, maps...) and excludes certain ones for not meeting certain criteria?
i know that was done in non-alpha builds to exclude the unused enemies, though not sure where that code is

Ok here we go
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/blob/e98411dec18d22c3b0521e24a42c1992c89d1c23/src/zq_misc.cpp#L565
Not too complex sadly

I think you could do something like what `build_bie_list()` does, except instead of looking through the enemy's name, you would look through the enemy's type.
A bit annoying though since you'd have to get the enemy's data, while that function is just using a hardcoded list of the enemy names (I think?).
