When I was doing input testing for Connor and other runs, I noticed the Boomerang behavior had changed and was acting weirdly.  First of all, sometimes it seemed to instantly reload.  Other times, it seemed to have a delay when catching, especially if it hit something and came back.  I remember something being said about possibly being changed, but I do not recall when or where.  I will post the replays and call the appropriate people in.

Nightly 58 - 2-5-2023 Nightly
Nightly 60 - 2-8-2023 Nightly

=== @ P-Tux7 02/08/2023 19:24

Okay so is nightly 58 the first nightly it happened in, or the last nightly that DOESN'T have the bug?

=== @ NightmareJames 02/08/2023 19:36

It happened both in the 2/5 and 2/8 nightlies

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/08/2023 19:48

Let me teach you how to quickly find the first version something changed in. This process is called a bisect, because after every round you eliminate half the possible versions. It goes by very quickly.

First, you find a version where it breaks. You say it's broken in the latest nightly, so that.

Then, you find a version where it is not broken. **You need to do that next**.

Then, you look at a list of every version between those two (the "good" and the "bad" versions) and select one in the middle. If that is good, that becomes your new "good" version. If it is bad, it becomes your new "bad" version. You now repeat with this smaller range until you find the exact version.
Here's a list I made of all the nightlies since A107, in order:

So first, you should try A107 to see if it works there. If it doesn't, we need to go further to the archive.

=== @ NightmareJames 02/08/2023 19:49

I'd probably start at 111
I don't think it broke too long ago

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/08/2023 19:49

You can start there if you like.
But if it breaks there, gotta keep going back to find the first "good" version.

=== @ NightmareJames 02/08/2023 19:49

We also commonly call this "The Clock Game"
As the Price is Right works this way too.  😎

=== @ NightmareJames 02/10/2023 22:18

This is an Alpha 111 take.  As I expected, this works the "old"/normal way

=== @ NightmareJames 02/10/2023 22:19

I'm going to take this to Alpha 48 now.  IIRC I remember it breaking "sometime" between 48 and 57
But not sure

=== @ NightmareJames 02/10/2023 22:30

This is my test on Nightly 48 (1/23/2023), seems it works the "old"/normal way

=== @ NightmareJames 02/10/2023 22:31

I took a break around here for IRL stuff, and when I updated I believe is when I noticed it.  Next nightly I downloaded was Nightly 57, the 2-3-2023 Nightly FYI.
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) Please advise

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/10/2023 22:38

I'm not following your comments. Did you bisect?
It helps to, as you go, mark each version you tested as good/bad. Please don't send a comment each time, just keep notes to yourself and share at the end.

=== @ NightmareJames 02/10/2023 22:40

I'm first trying to retrace my steps on what happened
I started at a safety (A111), then went to the critical points.  Now I will have to probably bisect, as I don't know where it exactly happened

=== @ NightmareJames 02/10/2023 22:42

I'm just making sure we are on the right page

=== @ NightmareJames 02/10/2023 23:08

Test results:

```Nightly               Result
   48 (1-23-2023)     Old
   57 (2-3-2023)      Old
   58 (2-5-2023)      Slightly off
   Connor's Test      A good chunk of delay
   60 (2-8-2023)      Slightly off ```

Replays coming when I get time to upload them later tonight

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/10/2023 23:27

Being upfront: this is not something I'll work on.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/11/2023 00:11

Um... are you implicated in the changes that messed it up?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2023 00:54

No?

=== @ NightmareJames 02/11/2023 01:05

I don't know who's responsible honestly or if Allegro's responsible
I just got home a half hour ago and I'll post the replays I made when my show's over

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2023 01:11

(replying to @ NightmareJames "Test results:

```Nightly…"): So you're saying https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2023-02-05 was the first nightly where you noticed a input delay in using the boomerang?

What about sword? Or other items? Just boomerang?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2023 01:12

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Um... are you implicated in t…"): Big problem here is I have no idea what James is talking about, I thought he was highlighting some minor input difference between ZC and NES LoZ that had existed for an indeterminate amount of time.

=== @ NightmareJames 02/11/2023 01:12

Generally, my test condition was that I threw the Boomerang and attempted to use the sword generally after.  When I was on Nightly 57 and before, it was generally lagless.  On Nightly 58 and 60, it had slight lag.  On the test build it lasted a long time

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2023 01:13

> Nightly 57

What are these numbers y'all keep giving here

=== @ NightmareJames 02/11/2023 01:13

Nightly 57 is the 2-3-2023 Nightly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2023 01:13

Nightlies have _dates_, according to GitHub. If there's a number to be seen in the Version dialog ... well, I have no idea what those are, and they can't be correlated to GitHub UI, so please just use dates.

=== @ NightmareJames 02/11/2023 01:14

Sorry, my brain doesn't keep track of the dates very well, especially when you double up on nightlies sometimes

=== @ NightmareJames 02/11/2023 01:15

Nightly 58 is the 2-5-2023 Nightly.  60 is the 2-8-2023 Nightly
I hope that clears up everything

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2023 01:20

In newer nightlies, the "Tag" field is the same as the GH release date:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1072937448977469500/1073775508275339284/image.png?ex=65ebb95e&is=65d9445e&hm=d4d93dbdfe38e36cb81147169689657f63943c7a10445ef7bbbd4a39e3a8fbb0&)

=== @ NightmareJames 02/11/2023 01:24

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "In newer nightlies, the "Tag"…"): This helps in translation, was using it today

=== @ P-Tux7 02/11/2023 01:28

(replying to @ NightmareJames "Generally, my test condition…"): Yeah, this is what I meant by "an introduced bug"
It's probably not Allegro. The 1-31 nightly I played seemed to have the boomerang function just fine and that was Allegro 5
("fine" being as in how it's functioned since 2.50)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2023 01:31

`2-5-2023` had a minor allegro upgrade.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/11/2023 01:31

Oh, hm sorry

=== @ NightmareJames 02/11/2023 01:32

Again, sorry if I'm bothering you.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2023 01:33

But nothing related to keyboard input changed. https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5/compare/cf819df50e1554e4cdef2d28fa41ad96dcdfd5ba...ac72675719edd5795384371e047e5f9519d681cf
@ DeletedUser I take it you are just "feeling" something is off. Have you tried pausing the game and doing an frame-by-frame advance to compare?
I did that once to confirm that sword was being used in the exact frame after the input. Just pause, hold down the button, and while holding down that button press F4 (or whatever is the "advance" shortcut) then you see the sword come out right away in the next frame

=== @ NightmareJames 02/11/2023 01:36

OK, I'll confirm that later after I post the replays.  Knock the priority down for now until I confirm it please.
It might take a bit

=== @ NightmareJames 02/11/2023 02:57

These are all the replays from my tests (hopefully it's obvious in what input sequence I was attempting on doing).  They're all from the start to a certain sequence in Level 1 of Tiny Quest Gold.  Please advise if I should test any other input sequences besides frame advancing (which I will work on) as well as the latest nightly
