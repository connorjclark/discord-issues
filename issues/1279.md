2.55 offers fine control over enemies‚Äô size and hitboxes, but if you make their sprites any bigger than 1 tile it also applies to whatever death sprite you‚Äôve set. But not the way you‚Äôd think. Because it still animates by ‚Äúmoving forward along the tile page‚Äù 16 pixels per frame. so a traditional 1-tile sized death animation will be surrounded by garbage tiles, while animations drawn at the intended size look broken.

This would probably be something good to solve by default, but does setting the enemy to have a custom death sprite and setting that sprite to be 2x2 tiles in the "Weapons/Misc" graphic editor work?
Make sure the QR(s?) for Per-Enemy Weapon/Spawn/Death/Shadow Sprites are on so you can assign them per-enemy in the Enemy Editor.

=== @ Zaidyer 12/18/2021 23:38

The sprite can‚Äôt be set larger than 1 tile in the sprite editor. It inherits the size attributes of the enemy that calls for it.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/18/2021 23:38

(That's a thing now too if you haven't noticed. Now all walking enemies can have LTTP-style shadows, even custom ones tailored to their size)
(replying to @ Zaidyer "The sprite can‚Äôt be set large‚Ä¶"): Okay that's... odd
I must have misremembered, sorry.

yeah, all a sprite data does is give a tile and animation data
no size data
and the code used clearly doesn't account for size changes

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 00:10

i presume it isn't but should be doing the anim.skip x and y like combos can and large enemies do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/19/2021 00:10

....yes, that would indeed be the bug
as I said, the code used clearly doesn't account for size changes

awesome

=== @ Zaidyer 12/19/2021 20:47

The reported fix appears not to exist.
I set a 2x2 enemy's death sprite to an intentionally-designed animation meant for a 2x2 bounding box, but it still displays incorrectly.

The animation is 6 frames long, and therefore it should look like it's showing four of the same number in a single frame of animation, and go all the way up to showing four 6s.
Instead, it looks like this, and stops after showing four 3s, indicating that even though the bounding box of the animation is 2 tiles wide, it's only advancing across the tile page 1 tile per frame.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 21:09

this should probably be checked for spawns and shadows too

=== @ Zaidyer 12/20/2021 02:30

Further testing reveals that the reason the fix didn't appear to work was because the Compatibility Rule "hard-coded shadow/spawn/death anim frames" was enabled.

=== @ Zaidyer 12/20/2021 02:37

So technically, this bug *is* fixed, but not for the hard-coded variety of death animations. Not sure if there's a reason to fix those.

should fix even with compat rule enabled?
