Maybe as a work around for all the warp wackiness, there just be a Generic Warp type. Flag for if drawn over or under, sensitive or bottom only, "walking down" animation (dir up, cuts sprite off at the top of the combo), "walking up" (dir up, no sprite cutoff), and "walk out" (forces walking from return square). Attribs for forcing return square spawn direction, and the number of frames for the "walk out"

I feel like in rewrite, a lot of things can be reduced down to some catchall generic types like this

That makes a lot of sense for rewrite, yeah

Oooo, how about for now, just make a "ignore return square rules and force direction" and "walk out" flags/attribs to the already existing warp combo types?
