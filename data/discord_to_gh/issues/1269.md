Port some ghost movement behaviors to internal functions on `npc->`
First up is `MoveAtAngle()`

So
```cpp
/* Script-only enemy movement functions (Ghost-based)
 * These functions will simply move the enemy, and check collision; they are not
 *     grid-locked, and have no other side effects.
 */
bool MovePaused();
 * Returns true if the enemy shouldn't be moving
 *   i.e. spawning, dying, stunned, clock active, etc
 * Should be checked before calling movement functions below

bool MoveXY(float dx, float dy, int special)
 * Attempts to move the enemy by 'dx, dy'; obeying solidity.
 * Use the 'SPW_' constants to provide a special value;
 *     i.e. 'SPW_FLOATER' for flying enemies.
 * Use 'SPW_NONE' if you don't know what to use.
 * Returns true if the enemy moves the full distance,
 *     false if it is blocked by something.
 
bool CanMoveXY(float dx, float dy, int special)
 * Same as above, but doesn't actually move the enemy,
 *     just returns the success state if it were to move.

bool Move(int dir, float pxamnt, int special)
 * Attempts to move the enemy by 'pxamnt' pixels in the
 *     'dir' direction; obeying solidity.
 * Use the 'SPW_' constants to provide a special value;
 *     i.e. 'SPW_FLOATER' for flying enemies.
 * Use 'SPW_NONE' if you don't know what to use.
 * Returns true if the enemy moves the full distance,
 *     false if it is blocked by something.
 
bool CanMove(int dir, float pxamnt, int special)
 * Same as above, but doesn't actually move the enemy,
 *     just returns the success state if it were to move.

bool MoveAtAngle(float degrees, float pxamnt, int special)
 * Attempts to move the enemy by 'pxamnt' pixels in the
 *     'degrees' angle; obeying solidity.
 * Use the 'SPW_' constants to provide a special value;
 *     i.e. 'SPW_FLOATER' for flying enemies.
 * Use 'SPW_NONE' if you don't know what to use.
 * Returns true if the enemy moves the full distance,
 *     false if it is blocked by something.
 
bool CanMoveAtAngle(float degrees, float pxamnt, int special)
 * Same as above, but doesn't actually move the enemy,
 *     just returns the success state if it were to move.```
Also, movement flags `Only on Water` and `Only on Shallow Water` (if both are checked, the enemy can walk on both types; if EITHER is checked, they can't walk on normal land anymore)
(These flags DO NOT apply to engine movement, and thus do not apply to engine enemy spawn locations, sadly.... perhaps @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) can help with that)
(but, they apply to all of these script functions)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 13:48

The enemy in the video is calling `Move(dir, 4, 0)` where dir is `RandGen->Rand(0,7);`
so, 400 step rate in completely random directions

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 13:49

How do they interact with diagonal collisions? Like if it's going at a -45 degree angle and hits a north wall, does it slide along it by the X vector still or come to a dead stop?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 13:49

It's behavior is directly copied from `Ghost_MoveXY`

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 13:49

👌

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 13:50

aside from, you know, the ghost flags and shit
and being a bit more sanely laid out

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 13:50

I do mourn the loss of movement flags but 99% of cases they wouldn't be needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 13:50

but, where that calls `Ghost_CanMove()`, I call a new version of the engine's canmove
which has less of the engine hardcoded shit in it
and is smarter

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 13:51

And like 0.1% of cases ghost.zh itself wasn't enough

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 13:51

What move flags would you want, particularly?
Because with this you can now make water-only, shallow-water-only, water-or-shallow-water, and flying enemies
(flying uses the `special` value of `SPW_FLOATER`, same as engine movement functions)

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 13:52

Pits only might be a good one. Also something governing interaction with various no enemy flags. I assume SPW_FLOATER does that in part

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 13:52

It'll use ground enemy flags unless it's SPW_FLOATER
then it does flying enemy flags
Jump enemy flags hard-codedly check for eeTEK
sooo

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 13:53

Ghost had it possible to completely ignore no enemy and that came in handy sometimes
It also had the ability to respect no enemy but ignore solidity which also came in handy a few times

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 13:54

Ignoring no enemy sounds less easy

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 13:54

darn

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 13:54

just because of how.... interconnected some of this stuff still is
I basically have been surgically pulling bit by bit out of the spaghetti mess
and the no enemy flags is one of the few bits that's still tangled
.....Not saying it can't happen, but not happening *today*
Pits should be easy enough
SPW_FLOATER ignores solidity, because, you know, flying enemy
(replying to @ Moosh "It also had the ability to re…"): so that should work for this^

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 13:56

Oh yeah, that's convenient
I think this is hitting most of the broad cases though
Ah! There's also move offscreen
Though I can't think of many cases where I've used that _and_ respected solidity

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 13:59

Oh... yeah.... move offscreen might be interesting....
though not gonna do that now, as I just realized that the pit flag uses the last flag slot that there was
so I need to expand that.... and blehg not doing that this moment

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 13:59

I assume these all work more like presets than a set of flags that can be combined

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 13:59

They can be combined

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 14:00

Ah, splendid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 14:00

if you set `only pits` and `only water`, the enemy can walk on pits and water, but not shallow water or land
etc

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 14:00

Dope

=== @ Deathrider 12/17/2021 14:00

Cant wait for this

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 14:01

Only pits might be a bit niche if you're still debating what to include
Just made sense to me since only water is a thing

=== @ Deathrider 12/17/2021 14:01

I can think of a use case

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 14:01

Yeah I was immediately thinking of enemies hiding out in pits or lava combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 14:01

only pits should be easy enough to add since it's just a clone of the water logic
keep in mind that, right now, these only work for the script functions; and thus don't affect the enemy spawn location checking

=== @ Moosh 12/17/2021 14:02

Right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 14:02

(in the video, I placed an enemy placement flag on the water to force the spawn location)

=== @ Deathrider 12/17/2021 14:03

I can also think of a situation of a room full of pits and you have some hover item and you need to time your hover to go over the pits and there are enemies to avoid (perhaps a boss with this sort of mechanic)
Perhaps you have a hover item but if an enemy hits you you lose the hover ability so avoiding them is key
Fun puzzle ideas

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 14:05

Also note that solid water counts as `not water` if the QR `can't swim in solid water` is on

=== @ Deathrider 12/17/2021 14:06

I am also assuming there are hover items that allow walk on pits (if not engine)
Such as the OoT hover boots

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 14:07

hover boots activate if you walk over a pitfall

=== @ Deathrider 12/17/2021 14:07

Can you modify the hover duration?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 14:07

....as you always have been able to
hover boots aren't new

=== @ Deathrider 12/17/2021 14:07

Sweet
Good to know

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 14:08

Just gonna make a pin here with ideas:
-Ignore 'no enemy' flags
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 14:13

All of these should work
....let's hope nothing is terribly wrong, time to release the hounds on it and post a build once I build it clean.....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 16:00

#deleted-channel A100 includes these woohoo

=== @ P-Tux7 12/18/2021 08:04

whoa
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Just gonna make a pin here wi…"): please don't forget combo type
also what's enemy movement got so far? or is it empty

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/18/2021 08:06

empty

=== @ P-Tux7 12/18/2021 08:06

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) hey we can add that shark enemy someone proposed in the 2.50 enemy contest now (the one that only walks on water)
er well, *i* can, to cambria 2.55

=== @ P-Tux7 12/18/2021 08:09

something else i'd like to suggest is a combo type or flag for leever-walkable terrain
and an enemy move flag that makes it only able to spawn or walk on such a combo
i.e. leevers only able to move over "sand"
can't remember who proposed it but it made sense
...or perhaps just a "no leevers" flag? idk
