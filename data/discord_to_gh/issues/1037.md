In all Collision functions all hitboxes are extended 1 pixel rightwards and 1 pixel downwards. Here is the example from std_functions.zh.
```

// Returns true if there is a collision between Link's hitbox and the FFC's.
// This only checks hitboxes.
bool LinkCollision(ffc f) 
{
    int ax = Link->X + Link->HitXOffset;
    int ay = Link->Y + Link->HitYOffset;
    return RectCollision(f->X, f->Y, f->X+(f->TileWidth*16), f->Y+(f->TileHeight*16), ax, ay, ax+Link->HitWidth, ay+Link->HitHeight);
}```
Here Hero`s default hit box counts as 17 pixels long, not 16 and 9 pixels high, not 8. In case of 1x1 FFC, its hitbox treated by function as 17x17 pixels, not 16x16 as intended. And that imprecision is across all collision detection functions in std.zh

@ Alucard648 this good? Did I miss anything?
