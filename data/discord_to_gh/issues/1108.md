Allow the right facing slash use the fourth tile in the sprite while the flipped right facing slash flag is checked on.

the same goes for the four diagonal spin attacks using the four diagonal sprites of your current sword
i think the reason i cared is because lttp has the sword "trail" for each direction
also this should just be a QR
