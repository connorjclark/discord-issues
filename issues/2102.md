Dear devs,
I know it's possible to simply set the ripples to a level dependent CSet, but it'd be useful for me if I could set it to different CSets whenever I want for nice visual effects. Would it be possible?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/19/2022 22:55

this would require script access to decoration objects
which.... technically was planned, though is so absolutely low on our current priority list

=== @ vlamart 12/20/2022 00:12

Would this also involve un-hardcoding the last few hardcoded sprite IDs?

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/20/2022 14:51

Alright, it is no huge deal, just a nice to have

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2022 19:46

Can ripples be assigned per-combo? I think that + using 8-bit ripples would solve this problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2022 19:46

you only have so many misc sprite slots though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2022 19:48

(replying to @ Twilight Knight "Dear devs,
I know it's possib‚Ä¶"): oh, uh, actually though...
you can edit the misc sprite data via script
```cpp
spritedata sd = Game->LoadSpriteData(sprite_id);
sd->CSet = newcset;```

=== @ vlamart 12/20/2022 19:48

That's what I mean by "un-hardcode", make the combo use a sprite from the sprite list, and not the misc sprites

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 18:38

Oooh, I'll try that! Assuming I'd have to use SP_MISC_RIPPLE
thank you

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:46

Alright it does work with this:
`spritedata sd = Game->LoadSpriteData(SP_MISC_RIPPLE);
sd->CSet = 4;`
However, it also changes Hero's cset to 0 for some reason

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2022 20:46

???

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:46

Yea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2022 20:47

Uhh, what?
...are you using `Hero->ScriptCSet` anywhere?

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:48

I am, I'm still debugging. Now I've placed a return in another script it doesn't happen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2022 20:48

If you set `Hero->ScriptCSet = 0`.... that will change the hero to cset 0
you set it to `-1` to clear it

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:48

Oh I'm sorry
It was my code indeed, but...
`Hero->ScriptCSet = -1;`
I am using that
Let me check further

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2022 20:49

....fucking
ZORIAAAA
I SWEAR
TO FUCK
it's bugged
<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:50

It could be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2022 20:50

No, I mean I just fixed the bug because I found it
and it's blatantly obvious

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:50

And sorry for the initial confusion, I didn't remember working on that code last time
Haha do tell

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2022 20:50

when you set Hero->ScriptCSet to a value
....that value was bounded between `0 and 15`
not `-1 and 15`
so setting it to -1 sets it to 0

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:51

Ahh I see
Well then nice find

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2022 20:51

The thing is, that is literally the ONLY thing in the ENTIRE ENGINE that can change the player's cset

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:52

And I suppose the original request of mine is no longer necessary, setting the CSet of the actual sprite works fine and does not influence player CSET

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2022 20:52

so when you had issues with the player's cset, really easy to point at that lol
Nice
I will leave this thread though, because, the combos are still using a hardcoded ripple sprite (`SP_MISC_RIPPLE`)
and that should be configurable, really

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:53

Ah, as in configurable per combo?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2022 20:53

aye
need to add that to water/shallow water

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:53

That'd be reallyyyy nice üòÑ
Then you could re-use it for many other effects as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2022 20:53

(meta) thread name was changed: Configure ripple sprite per combo

=== @ Twilight Knight 12/21/2022 20:54

Anyway, thanks Emily üëç
