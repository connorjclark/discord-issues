So I noticed that because water combos and shallow water combos use the first attribyte slot, there's an issue where when walking over water combos, it will play the shallow water sound relative to the flipper level, since there are instances where water acts like shallow water. Earlier the water combo I had before required flipper level 2 and as a result, it was playing the second sfx instead of no sfx.
