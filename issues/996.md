Hey, I'd love to be able to change the system black & white colors, would be very nice for my quest with a limited color palette and I'm sure there'd be some other good applications for it as well.

I don't really see a good way to do this, system colors are meant to be constant in all quests
they are used for everything from walkflag cheats to showing flags in ZQ to lens marker etc

=== @ P-Tux7 09/07/2021 20:47

can't one just change the colour right before they save the quest and release it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2021 20:49

that's not the point whatsoever
requiring the user to be smart in order to not break things is not acceptable
needs to be dumb-proof

=== @ aslion 09/08/2021 00:41

Would it be possible to at least make the screen transitions not always use system black then?
Though that's a pretty different request than this lol

You mean dark rooms, and perhaps

(meta) thread name was changed: dark room color select

=== @ aslion 09/21/2021 01:57

oh that isn't what I meant
but might fulfill the same purpose idk

Would it possible to have something like this for the screen transition wipes too? ‚ù§Ô∏è

=== @ P-Tux7 09/21/2021 16:10

=== @ P-Tux7 09/21/2021 16:11

(no hurry because i'm using black and white so i don't need to change those)
