New bug I think; when closing out test mode, it says SAVING, and sometimes it doesn't close out. I have to use task manager.

@ Jared yeah, you did report it

=== @ Jared 05/05/2023 23:51

Ah okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/05/2023 23:52

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) any chance you might know about this? I'm betting it's *probably* one of your changes, since I haven't changed anything I would expect to affect this in the slightest in quite a while
@ Jared any clue what version this started in?

=== @ Jared 05/05/2023 23:53

I don't sadly. I know it's been a problem for awhile though

This is the version I'm using now, about to upgrade

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/05/2023 23:54

Immediate question, do you have the option set to record replays in test mode @ Jared ?
Because that's the only thing I can think of affecting test mode during closing

=== @ Jared 05/05/2023 23:55

this?

I don't use it though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/05/2023 23:55

No
That's for saves, that's the non-test-mode setting
The test one would either be in ZQ or ZCL somewhere, not ZC
ZCL I'm pretty sure has it

=== @ Jared 05/05/2023 23:57

I
I'm not seeing it in the launcher

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/05/2023 23:58

Let me get to my pc

=== @ Jared 05/05/2023 23:58

Okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/06/2023 00:01

(It's a ZQ config, because only ZQ reads it- it's part of ZQ's testing mode, and is read when you hit Test in the dialog popup)

=== @ Jared 05/06/2023 00:02

Ahhh okay
Sorry

=== @ Jared 05/06/2023 00:05

Yes, on this version i have that option

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/06/2023 00:05

Curious if it still occurs with that unchecked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/06/2023 00:07

(feels as though an issue in saving the recording would be most likely to cause this, so I would hope that toggling that off would fix it. That is *OFF* by default, for the record, so you would have had to enable that at some point for it to be on)

=== @ Jared 05/06/2023 00:07

Yeah, it was off for me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/06/2023 00:07

oh, it WAS off?
nevermind then
back to square 1
....which means I don't have a single idea how to reproduce the issue or begin debugging it
I've definitely been using test mode, and have not once had this occur, sooooo

=== @ Jared 05/06/2023 00:13

Weird....
I just upgraded, I wonder if it's been fixed. I'll keep trying

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/31/2023 00:00

@ Jared have you had this issue lately?

=== @ Jared 07/31/2023 00:01

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@ Jared have yo…"): Nope!
