Don't know if this would be simple or not, but this might need to be corrected/streamlined to Always/Once Per Level/One Time Only.  If an example needed @ Moosh and I can give one

I mean

there are checkboxes right there
`once per level` isn't a thing, and that would be harder to add

Hrmmmmmmmmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 20:46

`Only Held`, if not obvious, would only play it if you hold up the item
while `Always` determines if it is once-only or not

=== @ NightmareJames 09/08/2021 20:48

I'll review this and get back to you

=== @ NightmareJames 09/08/2021 20:51

I guess with keys and bombs I'd prefer you only get the message either first time or during the level, not after every time, you shut down the game, or run out of bombs

=== @ NightmareJames 09/08/2021 20:52

And bombs are tricky in classic quests because they disappear when you have zero and reappear when you collect another one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 20:55

well that still wouldn't make it repeat
once-per-level isn't a thing
but once-only would be once-only
literally once it plays the string, it marks it as `read`, and it won't play it again ever

=== @ NightmareJames 09/08/2021 21:00

Yes, some items repeat and you'd definitely want that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 21:00

it should either repeat every time or never
or only when held up
based on those flags
any other behavior is a bug to report

=== @ NightmareJames 09/08/2021 21:01

OK, I'll check my settings.  If Moosh and I see it again we will report it

=== @ NightmareJames 09/08/2021 21:12

Thank you
