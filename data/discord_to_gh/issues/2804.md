I don't know if this is even possible for a request, but I'm working on a "Fence" style AutoCombo.  It's just a happy little cloud consisting of a 3x3 cloud arrangement.  The middle combo is the inside and it doesn't need anything more.

But when I use the same combo (the one in the middle) it says that I can't reuse it because it has the same ID.  I don't really feel the need to make the same exact combo over and over again just to bypass this error.   ... I mean, I will if I have to, but why should we have to if this scenario exists.

Or is the solution just to use a Basic Relational setup?

Either way, maybe someone has an excuse for why they want to bypass it.  Perhaps a sanity check shouldn't be a restriction.  It should just be a warning that's displayed once and then lets them proceed?

Depends on the setup. If you bypass the blank combo requirement it'd probably not work unless you have the default case combo filled in. In the case of basic believe that'd be the bottom right 1x1

If you were to bypass the dupes requirement it'd fare way worse. It wouldn't be able to tell apart the duplicate combos and should treat them as as whatever the first instance of the combo was. Not really all that useful

What you can do if you want do do a partial setup is shift click auto generate. This will fill in all the unassigned combos automatically with whatever junk you wanna assign it to
I usually go top-left of the last combo page

Hm.  I appreciate the insights.  It looks like the solution really did end up to just make duplicate combos anyway.  The "random junk" would certainly show up while drawing.  How could it not.

For a 3x3 Relational, I ended up using the Basic Relational (top-most mode) anyway, and only had to make 7 new combos for it.  Not too bad.  Thanks anyway!

=== @ Moosh 10/31/2023 15:02

It would, but you'd put if over combos you're not using
So it shows a placeholder in those spots while you're drawing and when you're done there's no placeholders left
