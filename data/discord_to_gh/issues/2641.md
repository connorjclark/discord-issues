I deactivated the Gold Ring in Equipment Items my quest and it is still showing on "Show Unowned Items.  It should show the Red Ring equivalent as maximum.

...though frankly @ Moosh can probably fix this
it just isn't checking the flag in `int32_t current_item_id(int32_t itemtype, bool, bool, bool)` in `zquest.cpp`
