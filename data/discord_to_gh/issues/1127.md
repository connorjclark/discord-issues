The ZScript compiler crashes after two unsuccessful compiles in a given session. This triggers on the second failed compile of the session. When it crashes on the second fail varies. Sometimes it will report the error and then crash after you click the prompt while at other times it will crash before then.

Build: Latest nightly.
OS: Windows 10.

fucking REALLY
I thought I fixed ittttttttt

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 14:31

. . . I can't replicate it with the said conditions
This is in the `6:25 AM EST` nightly, yes?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 14:34

(`ZC->About` gives build time to the second, so is very specific)

=== @ Orithan 10/21/2021 14:43

Yes
This is with out the box ZC settings
The main exception being the include paths file being modified to suit the paths where my script files are stored.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 19:12

@ Orithan I cannot replicate the crash. Can you send a screenshot of `ZC -> About` in ZQ, and your `includepaths.txt` file?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 19:13

Also, what error is it throwing in the compile when it's crashing?

=== @ Orithan 10/21/2021 23:05

The error that is being thrown is through regular compile errors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 23:08

That is not the most recent nightly build @ Orithan

I'm pretty sure I downloaded the latest nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 23:15

well the `.exe` you are using there is not the latest nightly

This is the exe that's in the latest alpha

=== @ Orithan 10/22/2021 01:24

I literally downloaded the most recent package and this is the exe I have

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 01:25

Aye, that's 6 hours more recent a build than your previous screenshot
Is it still crashing in that build? Because I can't replicate it

=== @ Orithan 10/22/2021 01:30

I was replicating it last night but I can't seem to replicate it now
Even after repeating the steps used to cause that crash

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 01:30

(replying to @ Orithan "The error that is being throw…"): ^If you were replicating it in this build, that makes sense

Pretty sure you were using the top one there, and said crashes were fixed in the bottom one there

=== @ Orithan 10/22/2021 01:32

I have no idea how I downloaded that one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 01:33

<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400> you had a `12:57 AM` build time, so it happened.
anyway, given that the crashes were indeed fixed, I'll close this
(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒CRASH, MAJOR - ZScript compiler crashing after two unsuccessful compile attempts.
