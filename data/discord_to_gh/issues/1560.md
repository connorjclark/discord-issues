Have I never requested this one before? Currently Link's HP hitting 0 is guaranteed fatal, meaning there's no way to draw his health meter at 0 HP without rescripting it. Also I don't think immortal is listed in the docs? Weird.

Huh.  I remember Zoria implementing what may have been a single frame when the Hero health reached zero to run a script, but I guess that never happened?  I remember that I was the one that suggested it even for this reason, or to give the game a chance to bring him above 0 health somehow if it went below 1.
Even Alucard648's suggestion adjacent to this one ("Hero - Instant Kill") suggests that there is such a frame.

I thought that was weapons but it could just be a rule I'm unaware of
Seems like a rather messy way to fix things

I know NPCs Immortal exists, but it's not in the docs, because why would it be? 😄

=== @ Moosh 04/22/2022 14:04

Yeah I made sure to check first, both trying to compile and in the docs. As far as I know, Link doesn't have it

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "I know NPCs Immortal exists,…"): Oh?  What does it exist as?  Some checkbox somewhere?  A script line?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/22/2022 15:31

script

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "I know NPCs Immortal exists,…"): "Check ZScript_Additions.txt"
"This isn't in ZScript_Additions.txt"

lmfao
In fairness, this one slipped through the cracks

`Hero->Immortal`
```int Immortal;
 * If non-zero, the player will not die, even if their HP drops to 0.
 * This will prevent effects such as bottled fairies from being triggered.
 * If greater than 0, decrements by 1 each frame.
 * If it becomes 0 while the player has 0 hp, it will act as though their HP just dropped
 *     to 0 that frame, and normal effects such as fairies will trigger.```
`npc->Immortal`
```
bool Immortal;
 * If true, the enemy will not 'die' even if it has 0hp or is too far off-screen.
 * '->Remove()' will still delete the npc.```
