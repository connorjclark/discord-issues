Tried ripping tiles from PTUX in the tile editor and when I closed the tile page, all combos, palettes, and maps (up to the last one in the other quest file) were that of PTUX. Completely unusable.

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
skip_flags qst.cpp stuff....

=== @ Moosh 09/30/2023 02:44

So this is a known type of issue then? That's good. Got jumpscared by this in the middle of a map design session. Didn't lose much thankfully

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2023 02:45

so, what happens is, it has to load the quest file to grab from, right?
It needs to not overwrite the current quest file though
which is what skip_flags is for
which connor messed with at some point IIRC?
....because, like, skip_flags
is related to `keepdata`
which.... was entirely removed
so I no longer have any idea how this system works

=== @ Moosh 09/30/2023 02:46

gotcha

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/30/2023 02:47

Ah, that's of course not documented and a very unexpected use case
I'll think on it
But skip flags still works as before so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2023 02:57

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Ah, that's of course not docu‚Ä¶"): Is this not the SOLE purpose of keepdata?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/30/2023 02:57

I had interpreted it as a speed thing
But I suppose that was the real use

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2023 02:58

Aye, it was
Didn't realize you didn't realize that when you talked about this before

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/30/2023 02:58

Another example of mind reading developers intent across decades failing üò≠

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2023 02:58

Or I absolutely would have made sure you handled this lol
Because this issue has come up before
It's definitely janky crap lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/30/2023 02:59

Ripping tiles == from the Grab menu loading a qst file right? I did test that works..
But I didn't try saving after

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2023 02:59

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Ripping tiles == from the Gra‚Ä¶"): Well the report here is that it does not work and corrupted everything
Might depend on the version of the quest you grab from

=== @ Moosh 09/30/2023 16:50

It's specifically older quests doing it. I assume because they don't have section sizes written to the file? Seems rather unpleasant, and I'm not sure I even understand how this was working before

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/30/2023 17:24

Before it was reading all of it straight thru

Using section sizes to skip is what I added... but for older stuff  it can't do that simply. But there is a way with some work.

Push a fix for this, but should be tested a bit.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/03/2023 01:06

@ Moosh seem good now?

=== @ Moosh 10/03/2023 01:08

shoot, I was meaning to test this. lemme finish what I'm working on and then I'll check

=== @ Moosh 10/03/2023 03:23

Oh right, I thought I already posted here,  but guess it slipped my mind. I tested it and it worked fine. üëç

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 22:06

Cool, closing then! Added a note to maybe add a test for this...

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2023 07:33

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) shoot! Turns out I didn't do a thorough enough check because it's still clearing out the string table.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/14/2023 07:34

Which qst?

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2023 07:34

Same one. PTUX

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/14/2023 07:34

Ah gotcha. Will check tmrw

=== @ Moosh 10/14/2023 07:35

Thanks

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/15/2023 00:20

Pushed fix to main.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/22/2023 05:22

Also made a test for this.
