This is luckily just a visual glitch in the combo pane. If you use the CSet change thingy on a combo like in my video this happens.
I don't think this is a feature widely used nowadays with 8-bit. I use it here simply to mark what part is unwalkable in an empty tile

ok yeah that just is reproducable in that quest file what the fuck

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/16/2023 16:40

Maybe because a certain quest rule? I dunno
It's not a major issue, doesn't bother me too much
(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "3)  Drag and drop the file in‚Ä¶"): thank you, I already figured it out though hence the checkmark : -)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 04/16/2023 16:42

(replying to @ Twilight Knight "thank you, I already figured‚Ä¶"): üëç
I didn't know what the check-mark meant.

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/16/2023 16:42

Hehe, I understand it is vague üòÇ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 22:00

WOW
So
It was only transparent tiles
fully transparent tiles
it was not clearing a temp bitmap, and with fully transparent tiles, it early-returned without drawing anything- even though it should have drawn color 0 in this case.
Since it wasn't clearing this bitmap, it was getting random memory- thus the random tiles being drawn.

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 12:39

Thank you for fixing, but now it is not working for transparent tiles at all. As in it doesn't change the colour in the combo pane.

Just a minor issue, but I personally always found this a useful feature precisely for transparent unwalkable tiles.

Tested on latest nightly on mac
