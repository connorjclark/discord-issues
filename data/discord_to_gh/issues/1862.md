How I imagine this working is, you select a block of tiles, and press "M" to combo them like normal. If you go to place it over an existing block of combos, you should have an option to right click, and paste the tiles over the combos replacing the combo's graphics, but keeping combo properties like solidity, type, inherent flags, etc. Basically, you are mass pasting new tiles for multiple combos at once but keeping the properties of the combo the same.
If something like this already exists, my b, I didn't see anything in the hot keys thread, or anywhere else.

I could make a very short video of what I mean, if needed as well, since this might not make the most sense. it took me a few tries to type it and get it to  this point lol

I understand what you mean, but I highly doubt that would be at all easy to manage

=== @ Anthus 09/15/2022 04:15

It would ideally just replace only the tiles of the combos and not need to interact with any other properties of the combos
but I can imagine it being hard. still assigning combos is slowwwwww

Like, the GUI work to allow it is the problem
tile editor and combo editor are *NOT GUIS* in the traditional sense
so they are neither the fancy "new gui system", or even the plain "old gui system"
they are a clusterfuck of code that draws a bunch of hardcoded draws to the screen
so anything at all involving the tile or combo editor is absolute hell, by default.

Ah that's fair tbh

another way this might work is being able to copy-paste combo properties, so that after anthus makes a new block of (None) combos, he can paste down the old combo block's properties onto the new (None) combos. then he can delete the old combos and move the new ones to the old ones' position
that might already be a thing...?

Would this be a fair compromise?

The ZQuest user would instead just delete the big block of combos, except for a single combo, which is in the appropriate Cset and already near the tiles they want, and repopulate that geographic block of combos with that one combo.

That way it's that much faster to reassign the graphics with the same properties.

I do understand that making combos out of tiles can occasionally be tedious or lengthy, and I do like quality of life convenience things that speed it up.

My biggest issue with stuff like that has indeed always been having to speed down from tile page 0 to tile page 9 or 143 without needing to push "p" to select the tile, and then hit KP+ a few times to get the right Cset.

I'd be so interested in some button somewhere in many of the interfaces, like the main ZQuest screen and the Secret Tiles pages, which lets you set a default starting position and Cset.

- The upper right of the ZQuest main screen above the combo pages.
- The main Secret Tiles interface.
- The "Define a Combo Alias" page.
- The Door Editor.
- The Misc Graphics area.  (Like where you select the map.)
- The Dmap "Map" screen.  (I think that might've already been done by Zoria though, more or less.)

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "another way this might work i…"): This is called advanced paste, and already exists.
Decent enough a workaround....

If the options discussed here are not sufficient for you @ DeletedUser, feel free to make a new request in #deleted-channel- though like I said before it would be extremely difficult to manage, so would likely not be added for quite a while if at all.
