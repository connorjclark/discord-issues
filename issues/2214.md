latest nightly etc, entering the combo works fine.

cave (walk down) works as intended.

pffft, this was what was supposed to FIX the other thing
or part of it at least
bleh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:37

wait, or no?
That's a `Walk Up` combo, not a `Walk Down`?
@ DeletedUser
(I didn't change Walk Up combos at all....)

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:45

yeah, that's a walk up
walk down is fine lmfao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:48

....oh
for fucks
nevermind, I did change walk up combos
because fucking
walk up combos
when you do the walk UP animation, exiting
....use the function `walkdown2()`
Great naming, old devs

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:49

i did notice a slight rework of the walk down combo too but figured that was intentional haha
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....use the function `walkdow…"): wtf
youve heard of `walkdown` now get ready for `walkdown 2: walking up`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:49

anyway, you want to know the fun thing?

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:49

yeah go on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:49

Link's position there is completely correct!

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:49

lolwhat

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:49

....I just offset the "cover" by 16 pixels
so it wasn't covering over him
at least, I think so
I need to see it in an old build, but it looks sane, and it looks like it should be what was being done before
...except it shouldn't scroll you up at the top of the screen

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:54

this is in the feb 15 nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:55

aye, if you compare link's position in the two gifs you posted here
they are the same
but in the first, the 16x16 square "covering" him is 16 pixels too low

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:55

yeah right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 02:55

easy fix
I just changed the order of 2 lines of code in a bad way without realizing

=== @ tacochopper 03/04/2023 02:56

lol nice, it's always the little things haha
