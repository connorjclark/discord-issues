Am I insane? Yes.

The following enemy classes do not render as translucent even if the flag "Is Translucent" is checked

-Aquamentus
-Digdoggers (both Adult and Kids)
-Ganon
-Gleeok (all parts, including fiery heads)
-Gohma
-Lanmola
-Manhandla
-Moldorm
-Patras (somewhat)

Furthermore, Patras are weird in that the middle enemy/core renders as translucent, but their kids do not.

The quest attached contains all those enemies (and a few others) set to render as translucent and already placed down.
