It would be helpful in further testing and organising assets if demo/test quests used during development for new features were released either with the Nightly, or packaged separately

Packaged separately would be better IMO. Zoria used to package his demos with releases and it just contributed to the thing being unwieldy to download

That's smart, maybe in their own thread for those who'd even want them

it also didn't help that he packaged scripted quests which a lot of users didn't care about or at least couldn't tell how it was any "better" than 2.50

Just a simple one or two screen demo of how a new combo/enemy/item is put together during development. But I can see the bloat many of these could cause
