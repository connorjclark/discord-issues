also impacts in ZC. nothing spawns.
other moblins work

are you using just Moblin or Moblin (L1)
the former is the "guy/npc" kind like IT'S A SECRET TO EVERYBODY
I thought they had renamed them to have "Guy"? We gotta fix that for the new tileset, huh

Yeah Emily explained it to me
Regardless there is a UI issue here
Maybe just rename those dudes to Guy in classic quest

It is handled in the default quest\
should probably handle it for old quests on questload with a version check
