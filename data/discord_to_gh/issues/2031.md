Anything bigger than 2x2 has issues

I think I made it where you want to have them *not* get cut off
but unsure

If you trace current tile or whatever, it don't make no sense as it would with a normal 1x1 enemy

Bumping this one because it's still an issue ever since I reported it a few months back (It was then directed to this thread). BS Patras in particular are completely unusable because of this.

this should already be resolved assuming it was just the bs patra, but I might look into making it so the fix applies for newer tilesets being ported forward

OK - I'll remove "High Priorty" for this then, and let you decide when to close it.
