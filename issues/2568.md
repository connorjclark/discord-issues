when the HP per heart is edited from 16 in init data, the hearts on the file select get misaligned from normal when there's more than 8.
*16 hearts for the example, even though 15 are visible :p*
never noticed this until trying out the new package feature since i only used test mode
(happens with the regular zc player, not just the packaged quest application)

What version

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/03/2023 17:13

gonna guess this would be any version for months

=== @ Attempt 08/03/2023 21:32

this is 116
but yeah potentially this could've been an issue since HP per Heart was added

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/30/2023 06:41

related problem. I did file->new and set init data hearts to 16. layout looks wrong to me

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "related problem. I did file->…"): looks correct to me
settings are "left-to-right, bottom-to-top, rows-first, snaking"
so it would start bottom left, follow the bottom row left-to-right, then go up to the second row, and go right-to-left
note that `Alt Passive` has this set up differently

aha

`>>4`? That's `/16`... should be `/hp_per_heart`!

looks fixed
