@ Moosh made a script a while back how to implement starting weapons in test mode, but I'd like to take this a step further.  I'd like to have profiles that you can store certain weapons and armor sets so when you test a level or cave you have the equipment you would have going into a certain dungeon.

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 03:02

So basically the ability to export and import the complete set of Init Data from a file?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 03:02

(replying to @ NightmareJames "@ Moosh made a‚Ä¶"): This sounds like a wonderful *SCRIPT*.

=== @ NightmareJames 04/14/2023 03:04

(replying to @ Moosh "So basically the ability to e‚Ä¶"): In a way, so you can have multiple init data's for different situations

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 03:06

That sounds handy, but also a disproportionate amount of work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 03:06

yeah, thus why I said this would make a wonderful SCRIPT, and then marked it closed/denied.

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 03:06

Really it'd be nice if I could update my script to allow for multiple item sets...but that pretty much requires the user know a bit of ZScript. Which is apparently a tall ask or something

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 03:08

Any time I've written a "simple" script that can be modified by the user, it's been met with basically zero takers for some reason üòõ

=== @ NightmareJames 04/14/2023 03:10

I could work it, but could everybody else?

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 03:11

Honestly? Yes. It's a matter of effort vs. need

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 03:16

All that being said, I do have an idea cooking for how I could make basically this feature as a script
And now that the idea's cooking I think I'm gonna drop everything and make it

=== @ P-Tux7 04/14/2023 03:23

you know, i'm thinking of something
the "profiles" would be their own custom itemclass
and giving yourself one of those items via cheats would give you all the items
it'd basically be a different script for each item in the class but i think that's very workable
(...do items acquired via cheats run pickup scripts or not)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 03:41

(no but you could use a passive script)
(realistically you could also make some sort of fancy menu, have it so like, pressing TAB pops up a selector to let you select a set?)
(scripts can do a lot of fancy shit)

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 03:45

Hey guess what I'm working on now üòÑ
Figure it'll be a generic script that runs frozen, has about 10 or so slots, reads/writes to files, shows a preview of what items each slot has

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:01

oooooh, yeeeeah!
Frozen generic scripts getting some use

=== @ NightmareJames 04/14/2023 04:03

Thank you @ Moosh , pick it up when you're done

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:03

This type of stuff is exactly what scripts are for, and this is just gonna be awesome

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 04:03

I've actually gotten a lot of use out of frozen generics. They're one of my favorites

=== @ NightmareJames 04/14/2023 04:03

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "This type of stuff is exactly‚Ä¶"): I hate taking a half hour every time I try to set up a Sidestory test, lol

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 04:04

Killer for making any kind of UI that's not bound to a susbcreen button

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 04:04

Generics were entirely my design, every single bit. So proud of them, and so glad they've been useful!

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 04:04

they've kinda completely replaced global scripts in my eye
Like back when passive item scripts were added we were saying "oh yeah, globals are so dead now" but they kinda weren't. But yeah, this is it. I have very little reason to submit global scripts to the database anymore

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 06:54

@ DeletedUser How's this look for slot selection?

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 06:57

took a while debugging because of a very silly bug. But it appears to be working just fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 07:15

(replying to @ Moosh "@ DeletedUser How's t‚Ä¶"): Can see code? üëÄ

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 07:16

Yes, but I've gotta rework some stuff first
Thinking the prompt at the top isn't visible enough so I'm changing it to a Save/Load/Erase field with the selected one in blue

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 07:30

okay there we go
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Can see code? üëÄ"):

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 07:36

*beautiful*!

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 07:37

already seeing some things I can change. Like I could be loading the file in the TestPlayInitData's constructor and then store the file path on the class rather than passing it into every function

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 07:37

ooh, yeah

=== @ NightmareJames 04/14/2023 08:12

I'll give it a looksie later on in quest dev time, but looks good so far!  B+ to A-:range (could use some small improvements)

=== @ Moosh 04/14/2023 08:18

caught one last little bug at the last second before submitting. That gap in the items list at the start of the second row? That was me expecting 15 items per row on the X axis but 16 on the Y ü§¶
