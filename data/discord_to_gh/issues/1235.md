Add a 'Last entry screen/dmap', for returning to when drowning/pitfalling. This means entering the screen over water or a pit no longer causes a softlock as it will bring you to the last point you entered safely on.
Needs compat QR for old behavior

also should have QR for `Entry points update on safe ground`, making it so any time you are at z=0 on land it writes to the entry points, so it puts you just outside of water/pits

entering the screen iirc has a frame where you can walk back to the other screen before your should i be drowning is checked, though this is much more obvious and professional

Is it physically possible to create a combo type that sets a safe return point for the screen they're on now if they walk over it?  Or to have it even set it for that particular Dmap in case there are multiple unsafe screens that would send the player back to that one safe screen a few screens away?

Currently, for the same screen only, via script
But #1235  I literally just outlined an expansion for this

ooh

Also
`Hero->`
```cpp
int RespawnX;
 * The X-coordinate at which the player will respawn upon drowning or such.

int RespawnY;
 * The Y-coordinate at which the player will respawn upon drowning or such.

int RespawnDMap;
 * The DMap at which the player will respawn upon drowning or such.

int RespawnScreen;
 * The screen at which the player will respawn upon drowning or such.```
read/write
though, it will be overwritten the moment you stand on safe ground
(safe ground is: `action == none || action == walking`, `z == 0 && !hovering`, `!check_pits()`)
(so, standing or walking, on the ground, not hovering, and not able to fall in a pit. This includes the 'pull' into the pit as part of the range.)

O_O

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 17:39

If you wanted to say, write to those and then also write `Action = LA_DROWNING`, it would take effect for that drown

=== @ P-Tux7 12/08/2021 17:41

can this rule apply for drowning too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 17:42

it does
I just used pits for the test because with hover boots + pits it had the infinite falling thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 18:31

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒Cross-screen last return point
