As they are right now they’re super confusing and hard to use years after even 2.5 came out. Any chance we could get an upgrade?

Do you have any specific suggestions?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2024 08:36

you don't need to use a ton of separate objects now, so it is a lot easier than it used to be

=== @ Jared 02/07/2024 08:37

Hmmm.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2024 08:37

certainly open to suggestions

=== @ Jared 02/07/2024 08:37

Well, it would certainly be helpful if I knew the newer way of how to do it. Is it featured in the 2.55 or 3.0 1st question quest file?
I’m still going by the 2.5 ways

`1st.qst` is a 2.50.2 quest
and will not be updated at any point
`File->New` has the whole new setup by default

Ah okay that’s what I meant lol
I’ll check it out 🙂 thank you
I’ll let you know if there are any suggestions ☺️ thanks guys

2.50 had a very undocumented tile editor feature that converted a set of arbitrary tiles into a dungeon carving setup. I could see it maybe being helpful that makes a tool which automatically converts a single tile into a gauge piece setup. Unsure how necessary this would be. But I picture it could have two modes for radial slices and meters. Meter just chops it up into slices horizontally or vertically given a direction. Radial slice would do it like a pie chart similar to how heart displays in Zelda do
Aside from that I can't imagine how much easier making meter pieces can be
