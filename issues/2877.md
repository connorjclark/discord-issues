Basically a more customisable Heart/Magic ring that can work with any arbitrary counter in the game. Bonus points if it can reduce it as well as increase it.

the problem is you could only have one of them
you can't give the player multiple for multiple counters
because only the highest level of each passive itemclass works

=== @ Mani Kanina 11/27/2023 05:52

hmm, that is a concern
I guess it would have to be added generic item functionality if so, which I suppose is more work.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the problem is you could only…"): Would separating them by level and allowing keeping lower level items not fix that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2023 21:41

(replying to @ Phosphor "Would separating them by leve…"): No, the highest level passive is still the only one that runs

What about option for items to continue run if multiple of the same class exist in hero`s inventory? Off by default.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/30/2023 15:59

So, this would require completely rewriting how all items work entirely

=== @ Alucard648 11/30/2023 17:22

How long it would take? I think, as long, as guys.cpp.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/30/2023 17:22

To do without breaking all existing quests? Painfully long
again, *rewriting how items work entirely*
the entire item system is not designed for this
the entire premise of ownership of items is based on itemclasses and owning one of each
with button items using item overrides being the only way the system doesn't hard require that

=== @ Alucard648 11/30/2023 17:42

As for backwards compatibility, we could have two different item handling systems, as it was done with subscreens, old/new enemy tiles back in 2.50 and similar stuff.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/30/2023 17:44

I mean

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/30/2023 17:45

"rewrite the entire item system from scratch so we can regen any counter" is like... a very over the top request for what it gives
especially given how simple a script it is
and like, it's not like this is rewriting one thing
every itemclass is its' own thing
so it's like rewriting several dozen entire hardcoded janky fuckery bullshit systems of some of the worst code in the engine

=== @ Alucard648 11/30/2023 17:58

Aww. Good luck further in developing.
