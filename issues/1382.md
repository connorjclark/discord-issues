Rather than try to explain this, let me just show it with screenshots

Just pressing the button to tab through the different ways of displaying the number causes its value to change

we all float down here

hmm
that's quite odd
all of the values are correct
except for the final one which is obviously wrong
so it's converting back from LH to D that has a problem?

Pffft
the `zc_xtoi64` function, made to handle 64-bit hex numbers, had a couple extra parentheses, which made it read hex digits wrong. Fun.
(It uses 64-bit so it can tell if it's overflowed, and bound it back down)
It thought the `D` meant `9` instead of `14`

should be fixed
