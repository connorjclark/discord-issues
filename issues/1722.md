In the newest nightly, trying to open the F6 menu sometimes closes ZC. It is inconsistent. There is no "ZC has stopped responding" popup or anything. It just closes.
As F6ing is what people to do in unstable builds to save often to avoid crashes, this one feels pretty high priority

Also pretty impossible to pin down. Rainbow death crash is dead. Long live rainbow death crash

=== @ Moosh 07/09/2022 18:24

Had Ether F6 like 20 times in a row and no crash. But we've seen it happen twice on her stream now. She opens the F6 menu, hits Yes, ZC immediately closes with no error message
May be tied to play time or some other thing?

Three times now!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 01:04

was it 32bit or 64bit @ Russ

=== @ Ether 07/10/2022 01:04

64.

If you upgrade to latest nightly, when it crashes next I'll get a crash report. That's gonna be the best way to get this fixed.
Since I haven't been able to reproduce myself.

=== @ Ether 07/12/2022 14:06

Understood. If I only move individual files from the update over, is there anything I should be careful not to miss? I notice that only the new one has crashpad_handler.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/12/2022 17:44

crashlad handler is the new thing. All dlls should be copied too. I think that's pretty much it

=== @ Ether 07/12/2022 17:51

Got it. I probably won't play again until tomorrow, we'll see what happens then.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/12/2022 17:52

yeah, `.exe` and `.dll` are things that constantly update each build
plus whatever new file was added

=== @ Ether 07/12/2022 17:52

The glitch seems...relatively rare. I abused F6 a ton, probably even more because of the glitch, and across the last two days it triggered three more times, for six times in total.

=== @ Ether 07/12/2022 17:54

I'm on a postgame dungeon of the quest I was streaming, so there's not a whole lot left, but I can try to figure out some excuse to keep going if it doesn't turn up again.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/04/2022 03:08

I feel like we've fixed 2 or 3 places in the GUI code that was causing random crashes, so let's call this fixed. Assuming @ Ether you haven't seen it lately?

=== @ Ether 09/04/2022 03:10

I haven't, but I also haven't been playing much since I finished the Stellar Seas run, so grain of salt!
