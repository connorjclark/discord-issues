I just crashed ZC really badly. I don't know much about how I did it except that it was by unpausing somehow. After that it just played a continuous single midi note, locked up to the point of being unable to re-pause, and was eating about 95% of my memory in Task Manager until I managed to close it, which took about 30 seconds of attempts.

I'm using nightly-2023-11-04-2. I don't know much else and don't have a replay, sorry.

Pure server points out that leaving the program running while putting my computer in sleep mode probably didn't help.

I reproduced by pausing, advancing my system clock a couple months, and unpausing.
Gets stuck in throttleFPS. `update_throttle_counter` is never called, though it should be every 1/60th second so stuck at `while(!throttle_counter.load(std::memory_order_relaxed));`.

I suspect allegro 5's `timer_thread_proc`. it does not handle clock shifts correctly

> I confirmed this on Mac. I got user reports for this issue on Windows when their computer came back from hibernation and they attempted to resume the app.
This isn't quite correct. I'd actually managed to play quite a bit of the game, including a whole lot of overworld and a dungeon, before it struck.

It still happens to be an accurate bug report to allegro. I excluded some context they wouldn't care about. For example, I think that may have been "delayed" for you because of specifics of how our fps throttling work, which only relies on a load-bearing timer to have been called _sometimes_, like when your computer has rendered a frame faster than 16.6ms

That's fair, just felt like I should clarify.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/17/2023 20:44

i'm in the allegro discord and they see this is totally broken, hopefully related to what you found! seems like a good bet

=== @ Ether 11/17/2023 20:44

Exciting!

weird finding a ... kinda basic .... bug in 20 year old framework

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/17/2023 20:46

factorio was built on this! (at some point)

=== @ Ether 11/17/2023 20:46

Yeeeeeeeeeeeeah...

This is 100% fixed for mac

for linux/windows, it is 99% fixed. there will be a big pop of midi instruments when the clock changes due to suspended/clock shift. don't currently have expertise to fix windows clock in allegro, but hopefully someone from allegro can.

Nice!
