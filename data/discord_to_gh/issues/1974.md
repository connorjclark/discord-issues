Is it possible to get a built in editor for the life meter, instead of doing each piece by piece? I feel like it'd be nice to have two rows of ten (like newer Zeldas) without the hassle of doing so many pieces and figuring out if they're right.

Subscreen code is junk.

Fuck no the engine subscreen code is not being touchecd
just no
@ Jared if you want it to be any saner.... use a scripted subscreen.
the engine subscreen is BAD
everything about it is BAD
it's code is BAD
and it won't ever be receiving ANY upgrades
because NO
