If this is at all difficult to implement, please disregard.

I'm just reminded of how Photoshop has keyboard shortcuts and how the major artists who use it eventually master the program by mastering the keyboard shortcuts.  I know that there's a tangible different in speed of drawing by having to constantly go back and forth between the buttons and the tile pane.

Some of thsoe do already have shortcuts, but a shortcut for all would be nice
I like the idea of just numbering them, considering how few there are

I'm assuming that I don't know what the shortcuts for those buttons are, or what I should push.  I just keyboardmased, and all I really got out of it was "I" and "A" that select every pixel, and the Cset switching ones.
And R, H, and V of course.
Which _are_ the keys that select those 7 buttons at the moment, from the ones that currently exist?

`Alt` is the grabber tool
`Ctrl` is the floodfill tool
(those are the same as the grabber/floodfill when placing combos on the screen)
and `Alt+Ctrl` is the replacecolor tool

Hmm.  That might work.  Thanks!

Reviving this, could we just get the number shortcuts for the different tools? Since there are already hotkey shortcuts by holding alt/etc but that doesn't cover the select pixels/select color tool (former way more useful to me than the latter admittedly, but might as well add everything in for consistency) being able to just press a number and reselect the currently active tool and have it stay active would be nice. Especially if you have a currently active tool that isn't the default pen one.
