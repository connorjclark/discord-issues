For animated decorations so they don`t sync up.

Well, the same combo ID will always be synced
no matter what
Separate combos on the screen.... don't actually animate
how combos work is
each COMBO ID in the WHOLE QUEST animates
multiple combos of the same ID makes no difference, they reference the same timer and frame info as each other

I think it should be to animate at random frames within a specified number of frames.  Have it a checkbox option in the combo editor.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/16/2022 17:01

care to actually elaborate on that?

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 18:56

I'm assuming like a "Randomize Start Frame" flag (not start tile) and/or being able to specifically set which frame the animation starts on (again, not starting tile). I'm guessing the general idea is to make different variations of a 4 frame animation, without having to setup every variation in the tile page. I had a similar request with using negative numbers in the A.frames as to move backwards in the tile page (like for opening and closing door animations)

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 18:58

A.Delay like in items would be neat for combos too

Personally, to emulate this randomized behavior, I just relegate my animation data to combo cycling pairs of identical animation sets. 

I.e. if you have a torch with four frames of animation, I'd copy each of those four tiles next to itself to go from 1234 to 11223344, and make the "1" tiles animate for two frames then cycle into the "2" combo, which is two frames, etc. 

 So I'd have four combos
instead of just one combo, and I can put down any of the four combos I want, wherever I want.
And they'd all animate separately but similarly.

^
Do you even need the duplicate tiles?
Does a 1-frame animation not work?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 05/16/2022 20:56

I can try that real quick, probably.

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 21:05

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Does a 1-frame animation not‚Ä¶"): For combo cycling, yes, or at least should. The default tileset uses 1 frame animation for cycling a "weapon cooldown (block all)" in the crystal switches

(replying to @ vlamart "For combo cycling, yes, or at‚Ä¶"): Ah, good job past me!

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 05/16/2022 21:10

Yep, one-combo animation including a "Next" combo transition doesn't crash the quest or not animate.  Good good.  üëç

=== @ vlamart 05/16/2022 21:28

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Personally, to emulate this r‚Ä¶"): I like this now that there is 1 frame animation, dope!!

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 05/16/2022 21:29

The thanks will go to Emily, yes.  GG, past Emily.  <a:thumbsup:819342605665566822>
