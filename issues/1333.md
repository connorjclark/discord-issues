I feel somewhat silly digging up this discussion again, but I'm still seeing issues that are still breaking quests. When Zoria changed the Slash->Next behavior, it introduced a second bug where slash combo behavior is taking priority over secret triggers. So if I put a sword trigger on a bush combo, it will switch to its slashed combo instead of the one for the secret and will not trigger the secret until you slash it again. This is not the same thing as `Old Slash Combo Secret Flag Behavior`, so please don't dismiss it as such. There's something funky going on here still.

Here's an example quest with two bushes, one using the sword and the other also able to be triggered by the wand. The sword bush works correctly with `Old Slash Combo Secret Flag Behavior` checked but has the double slash issue with it off. Interestingly with the compat flag it appears to use properties of both triggers as it plays the secret sound and uses the secret combo but also produces bush leaves as if it were slashed. Ideal.
On the wand screen, the wand trigger always takes priority over the slash trigger, regardless of if the compat rule is checked or not. That one just works
Interestingly the wand trigger also creates bush leaves but only if the magic weapon was created on top of it.

small update also adding a hammer trigger and a strike trigger for reference

The hammer trigger has the secret take priority when struck. The strike trigger has the bush take priority when hit with the sword

Another inconsistency with trigger priority that I'm not sure if can be addressed: A magic wand shot hitting a Block All or Block Magic combo with a magic trigger on it will trigger secrets when hit from the west or north end, but eat the weapon when hit from the south or east. WEW

This above interaction may or may not be involved in an emulation setting. I got softlocked in Zelda's Butt due to the above issue and reported it to Zoria multiple times. I have no clue if he ever addressed it, betting no

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2022 20:37

I'll look into it
Sorry for the delay

=== @ Moosh 01/18/2022 00:47

Thanks Deedee.

=== @ Moosh 01/18/2022 00:49

Also since P-Tux pointed out it existed, I checked the quest report and it does seem to report flag 79 as a "bugged" flag placement, so I guess Zoria intended it to work this way. Though it does also report 76 and that one still works the old way

bump

Nuking the emulation rule entirely
@ Moosh if I post a build, can you test to see if there's any issues?

=== @ Moosh 02/03/2022 03:18

2.55?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 03:18

2.53

=== @ Moosh 02/03/2022 03:18

Gotcha. Will give a look

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 03:20

alright, lemme post one

@ Moosh pinging just in case

=== @ Moosh 02/03/2022 03:24

Seems to be working

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 03:24

woo!
Can you check the emulation rule menu as well?
I removed the emulation rule from that menu
I *think* I removed it correctly, but the old GUI system is <:WhenEvanPostsSomething:695894891389255711>

Seems to be gone

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 03:26

woo!
and checking those last two don't have any offsets?
They check the correct one?

=== @ Moosh 02/03/2022 03:27

The flag 16-31 behavior is how it used to as well, but I assume this is intended

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 03:27

yeah

=== @ Moosh 02/03/2022 03:27

How would I test those last two?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 03:27

Just check them and make sure the little checkmark is on the thing you just checked

=== @ Moosh 02/03/2022 03:28

Oh yeah, it is

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 03:28

nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/03/2022 03:28

‚ù§Ô∏è

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 03:28

2.55 is going to be more complicated
Cause I need to actually fix the behavior instead of removing it entirely

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 04:21

@ Moosh check #deleted-channel
This has been fixed in 2.55 as well now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 04:27

Still need to change the logic for auto-enabling the QR, cause with it being removed entirely in 2.53 it should probably not enable the rule in newer 2.53 quests
