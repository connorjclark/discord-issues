A combo type whose selected "triggers" instead block/kill said LWeapons. Highly recommended to work on layers so we can make it invisible and put it on top of other combo types/in aliases. This would also allow it to be used in conjunction with the combo on the layer below it, to have that combo be triggerable by some things, then have this combo above it blocking others. And once that combo is triggered, secrets can be used to make the blocker combo disappear. A possible neat thing would be to make Self-Triggering combos also trigger the Barrier combo above them, making it go to the Next combo without needing Screen Secrets.

Games like LTTP have certain weapons (boomerang, arrows, magic) killed by ordinary solid walls, and I think with the use of aliases this would be the most elegant way to let the user customize with what weapons that sort of thing happens, and determine what combos count as "solid" enough to block weapons as well. (For example, bushes, small rocks, and signs didn't)

=== @ P-Tux7 06/04/2022 05:22

(I mean, we COULD add a Blocks tab to each individual combo, but y'know, yuck.)

I.... could swear you already made a thread for this
but I can't find it

=== @ P-Tux7 06/04/2022 18:23

Okay so, after finding out the LWeapons tab needs 3 ints, I wonder if maybe a Blocks tab COULD be done...?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2022 18:54

No
... Could be, yes, but blehg
Block combo type as requested is far cleaner

You can now make `Min level` for triggers instead act as `Max level` (changes the text when you toggle the checkbox)
the new combo type blocks weapons that match the triggers
So, a `Max Level 2` block with arrows checked will stop silver arrows but not gold arrows
Also, this combo type has an Attribyte `Block SFX`, which allows setting a sound to play when a weapon is blocked.
If `Triggers Secrets`, `->Next`, or `->Prev` are checked, they should trigger when a weapon is blocked, as per normal triggerflag rules that work on all combotypes.

I'm adding a QR that is blatantly missing
`"Custom Combos Work On All Layers"`, as a better version of `"Custom Combos Work On Layers 1 And 2"`

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) should see this thread

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/09/2022 23:40

ooooh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/09/2022 23:41

and just tested
with new qr on
block combos do indeed work on layer 6
(the new custom ones, specifically, nothing done for the old ones)
The thing is, trigger flags work for every combo type
The `automatic trigger` and `button trigger` both run through one function, while the `weapon triggers` run through another
because the weapon ones need the `weapon *w`
so, this just adds in the weapon trigger function, and if it triggers, it kills the weapon, playing the sfx from attribyte 0, and continues through any other trigger effects set for the combo.
If you trigger one of these via a buttonpush or autotrigger, it will *not* play the blocking sfx, as it didn't block a weapon specifically

This part is just not happening though
A weapon hits every combo it touches, regardless of if any of them kill it, in a frame
and to make it not do that would require much reworking

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ P-Tux7
> This…"): What part do you mean? That paragraph had two things in it:

1. Layering a Block Weapon combo over a triggerable combo to create the appearance of a single tile that blocks magic but is triggered by arrows. Seems perfectly possible with this new QR, great job

2. Having the self-triggered combo on Layer 0 "tell" combos above it to self-trigger as well. Is this not possible to write?

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 01:29

Either way, thanks a ton for this. Not only does it add versimilitude by making combos feel more solid, but it also adds puzzle opportunities by making specific projectiles blocked and having to get rid of the blocking combo or push the block out of the way.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 08:21

OK, not sure I entirely understood everything you're asking
`1.` should be good, yeah
Keep in mind that if the triggerable combo is set to be triggered by magic, and the block also blocks magic, that the magic will then be blocked AND trigger the combo below; the block does not prevent the trigger
`2.` is a nope (not because it's "impossible", but because there's no clean / "non-jank" way to set that up)

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 19:13

So the only way to change the Block Weapon combo after you trigger the combo below it is screen secrets?
I wonder how you're supposed to do things like bush combos that can also block other weapons.
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Keep in mind that if the trig…"): I don't plan to do anything like this because it wouldn't make sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:21

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "So the only way to change the…"): or if the combo below it is a crystal switch, using the switch blocks ability to modify other layers

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 20:27

i think that isn't really efficient for single instances like bushes is it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:28

no
hmm
the thing is, it isn't like bushes `trigger` in the same sense as triggerflags, so hooking into that is a pain

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 20:33

ohh sorry
err wait i meant generic combos that act like bushes, y'know? (goes to next combo after triggering, doesn't trigger screen stuff)
or is that what you meant

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:34

bleh, I hate generic combos
they are a mess
even so, the question is how to tell it what to do
because, if you just want to say `triggering this combo also triggers the combo on layer x`
that won't work the way you expect
because then you're using the `->Next` flag on the barrier combo
and doing that means it will go to the next thing when it is triggered... including by a weapon it blocks

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 20:36

oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:36

so you'd instead need some arbitrary way to have triggering a combo edit another layer

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/10/2022 20:36

Generic Combos need an overhaul tbh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:36

and that sounds way to complicated to be at all intuitive to use

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 20:36

wait how would it trigger if the barrier combo blocks it, and the combo on the layer below isn't triggered by it?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/10/2022 20:36

But I don't know what that overhaul would look like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:37

In this situation, that wouldn't remove the combo below, but it WOULD remove the barrier
which would then not work as expected
so regardless, it isn't easy to do
HOWEVER
```cpp
combodata script alterLayer
{
    void run(int layer, int offset)
    {
        mapdata md = Game->LoadTempScreen(layer);
        md->ComboD[this->Pos] += offset;
    }
}```
2 line script solves your problem
put that on the "stump" combo that appears after the bush is cut
with the layer the barrier is on as the `layer` parameter
and, an offset of `1` to make the barrier go to `next`
or, instead
```cpp
combodata script setLayer
{
    void run(int layer, int comboid)
    {
        mapdata md = Game->LoadTempScreen(layer);
        md->ComboD[this->Pos] = comboid;
    }
}```
just replace it with a specific combo, like say, combo 0
combo scripts are really useful for this stuff

=== @ P-Tux7 06/10/2022 20:55

thank you so much!
