A combo type that takes the parameter of how long the player has been standing on it and, if the rate is exceeded, it changes to the next platform. Obviously, it would change how it works in sideview.

Attributes
-Crumble Time (in frames)
-Crumble Type: Reset, Cumulative, or Once
--Reset makes the combo's crumble timer reset once you step off of it.
--Cumulative makes the combo's crumble timer keep its value once you step off of it, and it continues depleting once you stand on it again.
--Once makes the combo's crumble timer count down once you step onto the combo, and it keeps counting down whether or not you step off of it. The crumbling is inevitable.

"Nice to haves"/future improvements
-Trigger Groups integration so that if one combo in the group crumbles, all of them do
-Layer 1/2 and FFC integration so that they can be overlaid upon backgrounds, especially in sideview.
-Some way to animate the combo when it's stood upon, like how the donut lifts in Mario shudder, at least if it's an FFC?
-Make the combo able to change CSet while stood upon as a non-FFC way of indicating weight?
-A future combo editor flag that makes pushblocks of weight X crumble the platform automatically?

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "A combo type that takes the p…"): For your "Nice to haves":
- Trigger groups have nothing to do with this, that's not what they do at all
- would work on all layers like most trigger stuff
- ...sounds... interesting?...
- ...interesting...

also btw I did not think of different types like you suggested (but LOVE the idea, should be simple enough to implement too)

I really like the push block idea

Do enemies also trigger this? If not, could there be a flag to?

(replying to @ vlamart "Do enemies also trigger this?…"): no, and no
(...multiplying these checks by number of enemies on-screen feels like a LOT of processing to eat up, plus, would it be all-or-nothing? or you you want to set WHICH enemies can break them? because then that's a whole enemy editor thing...)
