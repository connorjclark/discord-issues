This seems like #913 and #978

=== @ P-Tux7 09/04/2021 02:54

does this quest have any scripts?

=== @ DergerSwerson 09/04/2021 02:56

whatever is going on, the fact that its occuring across multiple quests elevates the need to get it looked at

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 02:57

aye

=== @ Saffith 09/04/2021 04:14

I think I see the problem. link.cpp, line 23975:
int shop_pstr = ( tmpscr[tmp].room == rSHOP && QMisc.shop[tmpscr[tmp].catchall].str[PriceIndex] > 0 ) ? QMisc.shop[tmpscr[tmp].catchall].str[PriceIndex] : 0;
PriceIndex is -1.

=== @ Saffith 09/04/2021 04:16

And str[-1] is 10, the string it's showing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 04:16

but the room isn't a shop
so that should short-circuit with a false boolean condition
...oh
........oh
......................oh
but
it needs
oh fuck
I would have taken so long to find that
needs to check `&& PriceIndex > -1`, I suppose

(you fixing and PR'ing, or shall I fix?)
@ Saffith

=== @ Saffith 09/04/2021 04:24

Sure, I'll take it.

=== @ Saffith 09/04/2021 04:37

Oh, uh... I accidentally merged it with another pull request? Sorry, haven't actually done this part much.
That one was pretty small, though. Not a problem, hopefully.
