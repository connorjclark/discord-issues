A bug that seems to have popped up in newer alphas
Basically

Say we have a situation like this. There's a cliff corner piece at the edge of a screen
In 2.53 and in older alphas of 2.55, if you walked off the screen and landed on this cliff tile, you could turn back to the  right and scroll back to the previous screen
As of alpha 105, you no longer can, creating soft locks in a crapton of older quests

This test was saved in 2.53. You can play it in 2.53 and in 2.55 alpha 105 to see for yourself

damnit, I thought I fixed that 😩

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/10/2022 14:23

either it got reintroduced or I'm a moron who didn't push; probably the latter

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/10/2022 23:49

I probably pushed the fix to the enemy editor branch cause I'm stupid
either way, fixed
