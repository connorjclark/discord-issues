What should we add to https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/zquestclassic.com/blob/main/content/docs/2.55/index.md
Is this page missing anything?

A mention of the enhanced music improvements seems worthwhile, as I've seen a couple people surprised to learn this was a thing. Though when I try to write a blurb about it it either sounds too small for its own section or overly desperate to fill up space.

Another of mine I might want included is the settings for invincibility flicker timing and colors in init data. I'm not sure if I'm nominating it because it's worth mention or because I really hate how the default values (flickering every other frame) used in every quest so far look

Actually realizing there's a section for init data vars already and the screenshots appear to be out of date. Whoops

(replying to @ Moosh "Actually realizing there's a…"): I deleted the image, wasn't very informative to have.

This looks good

(replying to @ Moosh "Actually realizing there's a…"): > * Invicibility flicker animation timing and colors are configurable (see `Init Data > Vars > Misc 2`)
that good?
