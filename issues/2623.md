So, I had this thought after playing some games, that it could be fun to have idle animations in ZC.

I don't think I need to explain that much about it, but I could see some funny stuff being done with idle animations, such as Link breaking in an Oracle style Goron Dance if the player has left the game sitting for however long.

Don't know if it would be difficult or not, just though it would be fun.

This feels like it’d be better accomplished with scripts than an engine feature, given the degree or customization it would need and the relatively niche application
