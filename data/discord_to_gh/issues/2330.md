The clicking is shifted in the tile editor.

This is the issue I've been having as well with the minimap

=== @ Jared 04/19/2023 21:15

Confirming that right click works fine

Test in current nightly (about to come out in ~30 mins) please
For the record, I have NO mouse issues, so, if you still do in this nightly, I need full details.

=== @ Jared 04/19/2023 22:13

Okay, just tested again
It works when ZQ is smaller
But when it's big/full screen it has issues.
Similar to that minimap issue

=== @ Jared 04/19/2023 23:24

It's weird, even in the new alpha the clicking is shifted. Sometimes it works though??

=== @ DergerSwerson 04/20/2023 03:19

mouse issue is still present in latest alpha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 12:02

then I need information
because I cannot reproduce the issue, so I have no idea where to look
Hell, you say `Tile Editor`. Do you mean the tile pages, or the pixel editor?
I don't even know which you mean

=== @ DergerSwerson 04/20/2023 23:08

Sorry for not being too specific. Its shifted in "Full Mode" or when the screen is maximized, not actual full screen. Examples of where it would be shifted would be The Tile Editor, the Pixel Editor, and Room Data for guys, and when you try to edit combos.(Solidity)

=== @ DergerSwerson 04/20/2023 23:14

I have to do some verification. hang on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 23:16

ahk, then this is a duplicate report of #2329
which I suspected
closing as duplicate, you can add any information to that thread
