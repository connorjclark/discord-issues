Here is one example:

They just don't seem to match up. Trying to get them to is super frustrating. Sometimes you're one off from thee left or right.

...is it just not respecting negative x offsets?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 07:24

hmm, the y also seems to be off by 1 on the indent marks
no it's accounting for the x offsets it looks like
might just be the y thing?
oh wait no it is off on the x in here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 07:27

yeah, because, `<< -1` doesnt work there lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 07:32

or wait no
on my actual pc now
hmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 07:34

but yeah no there's no `<< -1` effect here
why is it off here then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 07:35

...well, hmm
it doesn't actually process the xoffset itself at all?
it's just reading the dmap's `grid` object... does that not account for negative xoff in the same way as positive?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 07:42

ok, yeah, so I need to specifically handle the negative case, that's fixed
...oh, and the y isn't offset
that's a quest error

the minimap marked spots are off by 1 vertically, so that's all the quest.

the negative xoff had this one further left before, which was wrong. So, fixed.

@ Jared your initial post here claimed "sometimes you're one off from the left or right"... but that should not have been possible from this bug, it would always have been the same direction, and only when warping to negative-offset dmaps... if you have any further issues, you will need to elaborate further, as I can't see anything else wrong.
notably, nothing is wrong in this image based on your quest setup- there wasn't even a bug here

(there WAS a bug on the warp that was placed ON that screen going into the caves, which is what I fixed)

Weird…

=== @ Jared 01/07/2024 22:25

So there was a bug. Okay
