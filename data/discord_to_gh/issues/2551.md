So, I've started doing some proper cleanup of zdefs. So far I've moved a number of constants to a new file, moved the `dmap` and `Hotkey` related stuff to their own files, and made a todo list. (qrs were already done, as well)
Here's the todo of things that need to be split off / moved:
- zquestheader
- comboclass
- zasm\_meta / ffscript / script\_data / script\_command / script\_variable / refInfo / ScriptType enum
- guydata
- MoveFlags to sprite? rename from 'FLAG\_' to 'MVFLAG\_'?
- HIT\_BY\_ to sprite?
- wpndata / misc sprite related
- size\_and\_pos / related
- 'direction' stuff
- item pickup flags to items?
- V\_ / CV\_ / ID\_ versioning stuff?
