Right now alternate sword tap sounds are solely active on Bomb secret flagged combos. Would be nice to be able to set these arbitrarily

probably the best way to do it is a QR for how it works now
and just add a "tap sound" to the sfx in the General tab?

That's pretty much exactly how I envisioned it
