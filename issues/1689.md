Currently the only available Game Over/F6 screen uses some mildly esoteric terminology to anybody who isn't accustomed to Zelda 1. There's an alt Save screen accessible to ZScript with `ShowSaveScreen()` that has more descriptive labels and a warning prompt when quitting out. I figure it'd be nice for new users (and hopefully easy) to have a quest rule that swaps out the standard F6 menu for one of these.

My vote is for allowing the strings to be replaced (not actual strings just words) in Game Data or whatever because that would also help with translating quests

`ShowSaveScreen()` is from save point combos

and is completely different code to the normal save menu
and all of this stuff
is super janky
and frankly, F6 scripts exist for fully-customizable scripted F6 menus

The thought was for the (alarmingly high) number of people who can't manage even just compiling database scripts

But if it wasn't as smartly coded as it should be, that's fine. I assumed if the menu could be called up via a single function in ZScript it must be just as simple internally. Evidently not
