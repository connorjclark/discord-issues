Gonna use this thread as a central location to keep track of the stuff I want to do, in roughly this order:

- Replay/record testing framework
- z3 scrolling
- Merge emscripten branch
- clang-tidy modernizer checks
- Modernize CMakeLists (ex: don't use include_directories)
- Document how to build on Windows and Mac
- Restore old graphics plugins for Windows only, to fix importing
- Remove `ZC_WANT_DETAILED_MALLOC_LOGGING`
- https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use
- Linux build
- Missing strings bug https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/980981288834048020
- Add all cfg options to ZLauncher https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/981810426482413568
