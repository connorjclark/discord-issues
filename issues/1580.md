I would like to request a roomtype that basically a more modifiable version of the "Leave Money or Life" roomtype (infact it might need to be split into two roomtypes for a variant that only cost money) that allows for the shop type item list to be used to determine what Link will have to give up to unblock the way forward.

you....could do this with lockblocks
place 3 (or however many) lockblocks
that eat a specific item to open
or eat an amount of a counter to open
resprite them as the item you want them to look like

That is kinda jank when I fully want the npc, string and all

eh, fair
(you have no idea how hard new roomtypes and shit are, they are JANK as FUCK)
(anything that has to do with screen 80 or roomdata is just, like, AWFUL and SUPER JANK)

Nothing that worth doing is ever easy. That's something I've learnt over the years I've been alive.

if @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) feels like adding new roomtypes, she can feel free
