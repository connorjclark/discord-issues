A flag for the switch hook that makes it only use its cost if the swap is successful. This means the cost is not subtracted if the hook hits something non-hookable or something that IS hookable, but doesn't have an actual swap happen (such as a wait pushblock while an enemy is on-screen).
Oh, that reminds me...
