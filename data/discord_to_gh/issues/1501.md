nobody ever uses the number keys to switch palettes (what it currently does) as its pretty useless for most tilesets. i think itd be awesome to have a much quicker way of changing what layer you're working on in ZQ instead by making numbers 0-6 change you to the appropriate layer

This is true.  The only time I ever use the number keys to change palettes (Which doesn't even affect what they look like in-game, because that's handled in the Dmap Editor!) is when I want to make a visual map of the screens I have that are used as layers, and the screens that are existing in-game.  

Otherwise there's not much of a point to these number keys.  They're a relic of the olden days.  Freeing them up for other things would be interesting.

So being able to switch the working layer with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 would be really handy.

Which would also beg the question what 7 through 9 would do.
... as well as holding shift and pressing a number.  THAT could probably change the palette at that point.

Shift+number -> change palette, Shift+* -> Next palette, Shift+/ -> Previous palette.
