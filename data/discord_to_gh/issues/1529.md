When you delete a screen in ZQuest, currently it also clears its layer data. When using autolayer, this can prove a minor inconvenience as we need to either reassign the autolayer or manually reassign layers for the deleted screens

Hmm
Similar idea to deedee's suggestion in #1516
Which was a version of paste all that copies not the layer reference, but instead copies the layer data to the layer already set on the dest screen
So like, we have special pasting options

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:17

Interesting. That'd be welcome as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 11:17

Adding similar for clearing data shouldn't be that bad?
`Clear All`, `Clear All but Layer Data`
And anything else that would seem useful

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:19

I figured it could be a ZQuest wide setting. Because users are typically either using autolayer and want to preserve layer data when deleting, or aren't and would likely prefer the old way

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:20

But I wouldn't be opposed if it were a dropdown with an easy enough shortcut, like palette pasting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 11:24

Favorite commands are always nice
and, what I could do
is make it so that it's all in a new gui?
You could like, check which things you want deleted?
probably as an *in addition* to a menu with all the individual options
so you won't need to uncheck everything to check one thing, and then re-check the rest

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:25

Like a popup? Seems like it might add more hassle than it solves

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 11:25

(though I'd have a Un/Check All buttons)
I would think that would be useful because it could get a keybind
like, Shift+Del or something
and that's the easiest way to delete everything EXCEPT one thing
instead of needing to add that option for like, each possible thing

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:27

Yeah that makes sense

=== @ Moosh 04/11/2022 11:29

So like Shift+Del opens a special delete window, you select your options, enter confirms, and it remembers your settings from the last time the window was opened?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 11:39

yeah, that's the idea
not sure when I'll get around to this, gotta have the energy for gui work and shit
but, definitely a good idea on the table

I think shortcut and QOL options should also be in the launcher like the number pad shortcut option. So users can have their preferences before even opening the editor
