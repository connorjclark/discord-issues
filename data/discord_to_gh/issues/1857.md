Completely arbitrary and i don't expect many people using this QR.
but for people like me that wanna make a "modern zelda accurate" quest when it comes to button arrangement with scripts for example; *a for action, b for sword, x and y for items, etc*

...you can always set b button items? why do you need this?
if you were to not be able to set b button items
then the b button would do nothing
unless scripted to do something

=== @ Attempt 09/13/2022 05:28

i mean that's kind of the point.
having the option to have which item buttons are assignable and which aren't.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/13/2022 05:28

the better way to do anything with this is to use a scripted subscreen
no, like
disabling that QR for that
....I'm pretty sure if you disable the X button QR you can't use items on X
for example
so it isn't just the ability to assign them, it's the button working at all
at least, I think; might be misremembering, it's been a while since I looked at this
Regardless, a scripted subscreen would solve this easily
because then you have complete control over what's being equipped

=== @ Attempt 09/13/2022 05:32

idk how to script subscreens.
and the button does work if you script like `ItemA ItemB ItemX ItemY` stuff for example, or assign the buttons to some other function

=== @ Attempt 09/13/2022 05:34

i know this is only a me thing that sounds totally pointless. but for me it skips a step of needing to go through leaps and bounds figuring out how a scripted subscreen works

=== @ Attempt 09/13/2022 05:35

it's just weird to have A X and Y button qrs for assignable button items but not B

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the better way to do anything…"): we REALLY need your subscreen creator, or at least a subscreen header

=== @ Attempt 09/13/2022 06:22

idk. it sounded like a good idea to me. saves me the scripting trouble along with giving more freedom and options to the userbase as a whole, being able to choose which item buttons are assignable or not.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/13/2022 06:28

my point being, I don't think that's even how the existing X/Y button rules work
unless someone would like to test for me and prove me wrong

=== @ Attempt 09/13/2022 06:46

oh. the x and y buttons don't work like that
okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/13/2022 06:46

Aye, the rule just allows the buttons to work at all

=== @ Attempt 09/13/2022 06:48

i see. makes sense. the a button works only because when you turn the qr off it just defaults to selecting the sword instead turning off the button entirely

=== @ vlamart 09/14/2022 15:55

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "we REALLY need your subscreen…"): It would be nice to have a subscreen header with an demo script that's a 1:1 of the default subscreen, but all scripted
