This is in currently nightly from 15-06-2023, but also as far back as 2.53 and likely earlier.

Setting the room data value works fine for chests and other features, but when you enter the item cellar it's ignored. My guess is because the room is reloaded upon entering the item cellar.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or actually just a "feature" of item cellars, but deedee asked me to post it here.
