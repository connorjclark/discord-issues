An option for Wallmasters to just do damage (and maybe knockback?) like a regular enemy, while still having the cool wallmaster movement.

Bonus points if the wallmasters can shoot weapons.

I would also add WallMaster(warp) that upon grabbing Link will warp him via side warp, like into pit with insta-death spikes.

(replying to @ Mitsukara "An option for Wallmasters to…"): seconded it
though idc about weapons

Wallmaster warp should be a 2-bit flag for
0: Z1 behaviour
1: Tile Warp
2: Side Warp
3: ??? (Reserved? maybe a setting of 3 makes it not grab the player at all?)
And a 2-bit flag for which of the tile/side warp to use
0: A
1: B
2: C
3: D
possibly make this as a dropdown instead of entering a number manually
