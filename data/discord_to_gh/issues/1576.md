Multiple portals (in array/vector), stored to save file
zscript read datatype for them

combotype that creates a portal when 'triggered'

portal id (`(map<<16) | (scr<<8) | (combopos/layer/ffc identifier))`
When combotype creates portal, give it this ID
If there is already a portal with its' ID alive, do not create another portal
The combopos/layer/ffc identifier would be:
`0-175` (for combo position) `+` `176*layer`
or `(176*7) + 1 + ffcid`
combo would have attributes specifying the source/dest screens/dmaps, graphics, position, etc of the portal to create.

All portals would be stored to the save file, all will work as mirror-created portals do currently
needs to be a vector of PORTAL data, and a sprite_list of ACTIVE PORTAL SPRITES.
