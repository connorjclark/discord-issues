Right in the title. Would help people understand it more!

I think the old default tileset used to have a subscreen with a Z3 magic meter, but not anymore

Huh. I wonder why

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "I think the old default tiles‚Ä¶"): there wasn't any different setup
if the old tileset had a meter that looked different... it was just a different tile, which would still be in the tile pages now, as I didn't remove anything.

It‚Äôs not in the tile pages. I looked

(replying to @ Jared "It‚Äôs not in the tile pages. I‚Ä¶"): ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è then it probably didn't exist in the first place, or was removed long ago (before 2.50.2 or smth)
not sure what's so hard to understand about it though

=== @ Jared 02/23/2024 01:52

Probably. Either way I figured it out lol
You were right, it was easier than I thought

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2024 01:52

cuz yeah it should literally just be this box

=== @ Jared 02/23/2024 01:52

Yeah I did that already
Lol
It works good

plus the graphic being drawn to match, if you're using an actual bar graphic instead of separate container graphics
