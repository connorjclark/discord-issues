Bottom of downloads page:

```
ZQuest Classic is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.
No plans exist to ever bring the program to mobile devices.
Linux, Mac, and Windows 64-bit may not be available for all versions of the program. We are attempting to restore support in newer versions.
```

Also, at some point the site mentioned the browser version, but no longer does.

The browser version works on mobile devices.

err, so what is being asked

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/23/2023 16:32

Remove second sentence and last sentence.

Link to the browser version. Mention that the browser version can be installed as a PWA and runs on mobile devices.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Remove second sentence and la…"): if you just want to type it up as a new paragraph I can copy+paste in

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 

```
ZQuest Classic is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.
A web version is available at https://hoten.cc/zc/play/
The web version should work on mobile devices, and on Android you can even install the webapp to your homescreen.
```
would be good to add the link to the web version asap for the newbies that may come from vinesauce

Make it a link?
Or just give me access...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/15/2023 05:04

that is clickable link
links are green in the site font
which, is oh-so-readable....
(I don't think I have access to change theme data and the like)
