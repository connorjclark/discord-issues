Did you change any rules or say yes to the apply bugfixes popup when opening the quest in ZQ?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/27/2022 05:42

I did not open the quest in ZQ.
Fresh download.

Just putting this here to show does not look like that in game as it does the editor. For reference

(did not open in zquest)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 21:02

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "See image
."): confirmed this regressed in `15736d Fix 'Old String Margins' compat rule`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 21:05

yeah, figured
that fixed other issues though

wild guess from reading the code for a couple minutes
it formatted the old man's text as expected

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 21:10

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> it looks like it formats correctly in ZQ if I apply bugfix QRs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 21:11

b/c this code expected `right` to be 0 for old versions i guess?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 21:11

that change there looks maybe right
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "b/c this code expected `right‚Ä¶"): the problem is that old code there was a garbled buggy mess
but yeah, looks like that could be the problem

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 21:12

what's odd is that the zq preview "olds" is also 8,0,8,8 and IIRC it looks right there?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 21:12

though I thought I literally just fixed a problem that was reported

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 21:12

should I change there too?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 21:12

where I needed to literally do the opposite
#1879
make sure that doesn't get broken too

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 21:15

applied the same change in ZQ and it looks better there now too. ‚úÖ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 21:16

good

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 21:20

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Probably related.

https://ww‚Ä¶"): Didn't help with this though. I'll do another bisect.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 21:26

bisected to the same commit
this one seems a bit harder üëÄ

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2022 22:58

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) any suggestion on this one? I think we should resolve this before next alpha so people aren't relying on whatever is wrong here for quest development.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2022 23:39

I don't know and don't have the energy to dig through strings a 5th time right now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/10/2022 15:46

Seconding that this should be fixed before next alpha
I have energy but I can barely remember how strings work so it might take me a minute
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Didn't help with this though.‚Ä¶"): Out of curiosity, you just mean going back through each build manually until you find where it started?
or is there like a fancy thing we aren't using

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 19:19

git bisect
It is a very important skill to learn

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:38

also forgot to mention here, but
fixed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/11/2022 12:44

yup, looking good now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/11/2022 19:11

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "It is a very important skill‚Ä¶"): Huh. That's sorta what I do, but it's useful that there's something to do it automatically for you
