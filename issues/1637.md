I have no idea how processor-intensive this will be, so definitely feel free to disregard if it's outlandish or difficult!

Currently, in the tile editor, we can click and drag the sword cursor to place/edit individual pixels as we move the mouse over them.  

Imagine if we could do the same with the fill bucket tool.  We could bulk erase so many things at once.  But this would probably be very cpu-intensive or something.

Would it be possible to just cut the amount of frames it "checks" for that tool in half to save resources or something?

I just figure this ability would make it so much faster to modify tiles or erase large portions of a tile without needing to switch tools to the Hookshot to select a rectangle, then switch to the red wand tool.

....attempting this would probably instantly make you hit one frame per hour or something stupid
unless you were to cut frames for checking, yeah
but that's also not really an easy thing to do
and have it like
still work the way you'd want

As expected.  And there's no way to make it perform one action per 5 frames or something instead of checking every proverbial frame, right?   Still, I appreciate the feedback.

Why would this hurt performance to any significant degree?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 05/23/2022 18:15

Not that I'd know or anything, but common sense dictates that with every click, it's checking for every pixel-block next to the current clicked one, and every one next to that, and next to that, and that, and that, and so on.  A flood operation must be quite a significant one.  Now imagine holding in the button, doing that operation every proverbial frame.

256 checks a second for a program that runs capped at 60 fps
in a program made in C++(?)
not to mention the fact that the fill tool already works as-is, it would just have to not stop filling once you touched a new color

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 05/23/2022 18:26

if efficiency was such a big concern it could keep a cache of the previous color the mouse was over and only do the fill operation if the color the mouse is currently over is different to that as well as the currently selected mouse color

... That makes too much sense to think of!
