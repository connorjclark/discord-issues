The cheat modifier keys do not function properly. They did not seem to work and, after trying to play around with their bindings, I found a way to hang ZC

Alpha 103 Nightly February 18th 2022

=== @ Orithan 02/24/2022 23:52

I cannot unset the secondary cheat modifier keys

=== @ Orithan 02/24/2022 23:54

So it appears you have to hit all Cheat Modifier keys for it to work instead of needing to hit just one side of them like I was able to do before

Screenshot the config?
I know it was bugged before and we fixed something (though that was a while back)
But I also know it's a confusing mess

Should be either control + either shift
`Ctrl+Shift+key`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:31

if that works, that's the correct behavior
(replying to @ Orithan "I cannot unset the secondary‚Ä¶"): this I'll look into
(replying to @ Orithan "The cheat modifier keys do no‚Ä¶"): how did you hang ZC?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:33

(replying to @ Orithan "I cannot unset the secondary‚Ä¶"): I have no issue unsetting them

=== @ Orithan 02/25/2022 03:33

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "how did you hang ZC?"): By changing them repeatedly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:34

....how would that hang?

=== @ Orithan 02/25/2022 03:34

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I have no issue unsetting them"): Can you also unset the primary modifier keys

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:34

aye
you just click clear
and then press anything but esc

=== @ Orithan 02/25/2022 03:36

I did that a few times

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:38

(replying to @ Orithan "Alpha 103 Nightly February 18‚Ä¶"): ...18th?
screenshot the about for me
latest in #deleted-channel is 17th

Used my time for the date of the alpha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:39

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:41

Is it just a visual issue, perhaps?
If you try to clear it, then hit OK and re-open the dialog, is it cleared?
or, even maybe just change tabs back and forth?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:43

If not, you can manually clear them in zc.cfg (while zc isn't running)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2022 03:44

I downloaded that nightly again through discord
and, have no issues whatsoever
so shouldn't even be a build error thing
Maybe reboot your pc?
(or reboot zc if you didn't already try that, though, that seems a bit obvious)

=== @ Orithan 02/25/2022 03:54

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "If you try to clear it, then‚Ä¶"): Once, after assigning buttons
Idk the exact proceedure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 01:27

No issues replicable. Closing unless further info can be provided.
