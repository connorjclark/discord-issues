It complains about trying to reference a nonexistent file, then jumps to the start of the current script.

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 03:00

WriteInts() appears to have the same issue
here's an example quest

....huh
I'm looking at the ZASM
and at one spot
it's pushing 5 params
....and then popping *4*
and, it offsetting the stack like that means it `return`s to the *wrong location in the script*, which is why it jumps to the start

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:18

` PUSHV 2`
exists
where it just
shouldn't

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 03:19

wonder how that happened

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:19

Very good question

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 03:21

Also like...from what I recall these functions were first introduced because Deedee wanted to write ogg files in ZScript but it could only output text at the time. Did she not end up using them after?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:24

I added these and used and tested them thoroughly
something new broke them
From the looks of it, probably some function call optimization
which probably means quite a few other things are broken by the same break
but who knows how specific it might be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:26

....or, wait, I'm SLIGHTLY stupid
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "` PUSHV 2`"): this isn't the opcode that's wrong

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:27

....ah
the `PUSHV -1` is what's wrong
....BAH
It's because I added optional parameters to the function that it broke, not the optimizations
I tested internal optional params.....
......on GLOBAL POINTERS
Not INSTANCE POINTERS like `file->`
....and missed an off-by-one error that is caused by the extra parameter

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 03:28

waitwaitwait

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:28

(pretty sure that's it at least)

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 03:29

...if I stuck a `, 0` on the end there it'd have worked fine wouldn't it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:29

no

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 03:29

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:29

the problem is it's counting the number of params you passed (which means ONLY THE ONES IN THE PARENS)
and comparing that against the internal count
(which includes the ones in parens, PLUS THE FILE POINTER ITSELF)
and is expecting those to match up

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 03:30

ahh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:30

but they don't

(I had removed the Trace(0) and Trace(1) to simplify)
fixed
just added
```cpp
if(host.left->isTypeArrow())
    --num_actual_params; //Don't count the arrow param!
```

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 03:32

splendid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:32

would've broken on global pointers too, actually
but not global FUNCTIONS
as those have no arrow

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 03:32

Can I have a build just cuz the thing I've been working on won't actually work without these functions?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:32

and those.... are.... all I tested?
Give it half an hour, gonna post a nightly
we fixed like a bunch today

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 03:33

aiight

All of this today

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 03:38

also for the record @ Moosh
you're using `2` to tell it to write 2 bytes
....pretty sure you can just not pass anything there and it'll be fine
as the default value is `-1`
which writes `the size of the passed array bytes`
here being a literal 2
(assuming you don't have a situation where you want to write less than the full size of the array, of course)
https://www.zeldaclassic.com/zscript-docs/?jump=file%3A%3Awritebytes
> If 'count' is negative, writes from 'arr' until it reaches the end of 'arr'.
`int count = -1`

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 05:21

I think I was thinking of saving a step in getting the size of the array, in this case I know it'll be 2. Which I dunno if is actually an optimization or not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2023 05:28

not really

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 23:12

Okay I think there's still something funky going on. Here I'm tracing the values of the arrays I'm writing to the file...

Here's the file in HxD

=== @ Moosh 01/04/2023 23:59

OH MY FUCKING GODGFGHHHHH
the array indices
they're long
there's no / 10000
despite them being
FUCKING BYTES
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh

=== @ Moosh 01/05/2023 00:03

Not sure exactly why this resulted in the result being multiplied *16 but that sure is what was doing it
And I'm assuming this is also a bug. Because nowhere in the documentation is it indicated and it makes no damn sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 01:05

so wait, what's happening?
I'm staring at a wall of traces and going `huh`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 01:08

oh
....
yeah, figured it would be my stupid.

broken as of the new year

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 01:17

....should be fixed.

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 10:39

I've got some fucking bizarre behavior going on here now. Like really oddly specific bug that I narrowed down from my complicated header to a minimal example and it's just...strange

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 10:40

```        file f;
        f->OpenMode("stuff.file", "w");
        f->WriteBytes({0, 1, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0});
        f->Close();```
So this is all I'm doing in my test quest right? Just writing this array of bytes, which is what the header was writing ultimately. Cool.
Am I losing it or is that not quite what I told it to write? There's this 0D popping up out of nowhere

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) do you have any damn clue why  this might be happening?

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 10:43

...it's just the number 10!
but why
_why_ would 10 be doing this
OH MY FUCKING GOD
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS
was thinking to myself "hmm...I wonder what's so special about the numbers 10 and 13..."

It's seeing a line feed and inserting a carriage return before it. Because windows. Because this whole system was originally for printing text
ughhhhhhhhhhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 10:48

oh for FUCKS
that's fun

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1060029626065371137/1062322161685123122/image.png?ex=65e6f89c&is=65d4839c&hm=7e619d8896d9a4cd8e57479b09cd7e4d24eb72319442a714de15e68619b919ef&)
Nothing in the ZC source is treating these as characters/strings
so, uh, is it something in your program or?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 10:50

....though I realize that `uint8_t` does just mean `unsigned char` in the end
......if it's `fwrite` though that would baffle me

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 10:51

So from what I understand, file operations don't write to the file, they write to a temp buffer that's then written to the file when it's closed
Could it be this second write is what's doing the formatting?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 10:51

It certainly shouldn't
If anything to do with `fwrite` is doing this, that would like, seriously fuck up and break many things.... that really should not be possible

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 10:52

Yeahhh...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 10:52

though wait
what open command did you use for the file
`Create`, `Open`, or `OpenMode`?

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 10:53

Uhhh...OpenMode w. Am I a dummy?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 10:53

Yes.
`w` is `write`
...but you need `wb` for `write, binary`

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 10:54

Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 10:54

not having the `b` defaults to `text`

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 10:54

okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 10:54

`Open`/`Create` use `rb+`/`wb+`
`rb+` = read, binary, readwrite
`wb+` = write, binary, readwrite
(the difference being `wb+` will create if it does not exist, `rb+` will error if does not exist)

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 10:55

Somehow completely overlooked this
Is there any reason to even use OpenMode then?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 10:55

If you WANTED to write text
and have it handle the platform-specific line endings for you like that
then yes
....in C++ there aren't like 3 functions for this, you just always supply a mode
I just made `Open()` and `Create()` to handle the 2 most common use cases to make it simpler for users
but I left `OpenMode` in case you needed anything else for any reason
most of the `file->` stuff is *direct c++ access*
(replying to @ Moosh "Is there any reason to even u…"): oh, also, append modes
https://www.zeldaclassic.com/zscript-docs/?jump=file%3A%3Aopenmode
> Text files are files containing sequences of lines of text. Depending on the environment where the application runs, some special character conversion may occur in input/output operations in text mode to adapt them to a system-specific text file format. Although on some environments no conversions occur and both text files and binary files are treated the same way, using the appropriate mode improves portability.

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 11:00

Yeah I just got tripped up by the fine print. And the fact that it lets me write bytes and integers...to an ascii file

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 11:00

....literally ripped from the c++ docs
(replying to @ Moosh "Yeah I just got tripped up by…"): you can write anything to any file
c++ doesn't stop you
and.... most of the file stuff is just direct c++ access.
so yeah, it do be like that

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 11:01

c++ is a cursed creature sometimes. Not entirely sure how to feel 😛

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 11:01

thus my suggestion of python for your server thing

=== @ Moosh 01/10/2023 11:02

I cannot let go my C conventions

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2023 11:03

but python GOOD
