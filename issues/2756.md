A general flag for FFCs meant for moving overhead and side view platforms. In overhead, if the player is standing on top of the FFC, they inherit the instantaneous x and y velocity of the FFC that frame, which would pull the player along with the platform realistically. Sideview would work the same in principle, just if the player is on the tile immediately above the FFC.

I feel like this sort of system would only work with the newer player movement system, but correct me if I am mistaken.
As far as I know, a script is needed for this sort of behavior at the moment.

Issue: when the player is on multiple sticky FFCs

=== @ Phosphor 10/17/2023 00:13

I'd imagine it would just add the two velocities together. If FFC 1's velocity is {-5,2} pixels/second and FFC 2's is {3,-7} pixels/second, the components are just added together and applied to the player.

=== @ Phosphor 10/17/2023 00:14

End result would be that the FFC with the velocity vectors more similar to the player's resultant velocity vector would win out of they were perfectly centered between the two and eventually pull the player off the other FFC.

=== @ Phosphor 10/17/2023 00:15

If the player isn't centered, it's really a matter which FFC happens to not move out of the player's hitbox first.
No idea how it would interact with solidity though since I don't know how the engine handles collision detection

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Issue: when the player is on…"): it would just move the player when the ffc moves, so would be handled in ffc order

=== @ P-Tux7 10/17/2023 22:41

wait... that's a thought
an ffc that can move the player *without having to touch them*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2023 22:42

this is getting into script-ish territory
just a platform makes enough sense
but beyond that, scripts exist for a reason

=== @ P-Tux7 10/17/2023 23:45

oh derp i thought it was a combo type for a second not a flag

(meta) thread name was changed: FFC "Platform" Flag

(BTW, this doesn't just move for engine ffc movement- scripts moving ffcs can pull the player as well!)

=== @ Phosphor 10/28/2023 19:55

Nice! I'm curious how closely this matches to my idea of how it would handle player movement, like if it just adds the FFC's velocity vector to the player's every frame or something

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 20:23

(replying to @ Phosphor "Nice! I'm curious how closely…"): it drags the player when it moves
which is similar, but not exactly the same
notably, movement by means other than the ffc moving in engine (such as a script moving the ffc) will ALSO drag the player.

Will it affect dropped bombs by chance?

Only player
