This is a minor suggestion, have the option to show mouse cursor over combo alias mode.  Helps to draw aliases in straight lines without having to keep undoing if you go off the line.

Out of curiosity, what happens if you hit the " ` " key in ZQuest?  It might bring up a grid to help show you where the borders between the combos are.   Unless I'm thinking of some other hotkey.
That's the apostrophe/tilde key, to the left of the "1" key on the number row, in case it's not visible.
