So, uhh, we need to get set up to be able to modify ZCL.....
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassicLauncher
master branch appears to *not* be most recent, `2.8.0` is more recent
readme is
```
ZLaunch (or ZCLaunch, ZCL) is an open source launcher programme designed to run the Zelda Classic
suite of programmes: Zelda Classic, ZQuest (quest editor), and ROMView (graphics extractor for
NES/FC and SNES/SFC games).

It is designed to set the various configuration properties of each programme, that are normally
set in the 'ag.cfg' (Allegro 4 config) file, using a graphical user interface for Windows and Linux
systems. No MacOS X version of ZCL has been released to date. 

The utility itself is coded in FreePascal, and was designed in the Lazarus IDE.

Binaries for release are compressed with UPX.

Please also see the Zelda Classic open source project at:
http://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic
...for more information on Zelda Classic, ZQuest, and ROMView.

ZCL was originally programmed by Deviance on AGN, and has been released under the GPL v3 license.```
importantly, `The utility itself is coded in FreePascal, and was designed in the Lazarus IDE.`

...Why don't we just make our own Launcher?
Surely we could do it better

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 10:33

. . . I mean . . .
we certainly could do that
we have a nice clean new gui system
adding a new exe to the compile chain isn't that difficult, we have the external parser exe on there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 10:36

fuck deedee why do you put ideas in my head

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 10:36

Because I am a creature of hatred and unfun
Kill joy I do

God dammit deedee
I've already spend over an hour on this
I want to murder CMAKe
and whoever interconnected this many fucking files in this stupid of a way
I'm down to 13 unresolved externals and working it down
when that hits 0 hopefully I have the setup done and just need to actually, like, create a dialog

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 12:10

im the worst

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 12:16

I HAVE COMPILE
It'll run a beautiful ```cpp
int32_t main(int32_t argc, char* argv[])
{
    return 0;
}```
but it fucking compiles
and it has all the gui shit linked
so it should be able to call a dialog and the like
....except that, you know, need to copy all the `main()` code required to initialize allegro
and fuck that right now
I'll get to that *later*
blehg
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) why do you do this to me

Note the mooshmood colors; a showcase that themes are working
also, I abstracted the theme code into `zdefs.cpp`, so a single block runs shared by all the .exes, instead of each having their own fucking copy of it....

Also @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) I've added a set of functions `zc_get_config` and `zc_set_config`
the `zc_set_config` just calls `set_config_int`,`_float`, or `_string` based on the type of the params
the `zc_get_config` does much the same
except, you know how `get_config_*` functions take a 'default value'?
Well, if it returns the 'default value', it calls the `set_config_*` function as well, to make sure that default is actually listed in the config file now, so the user can edit it.
This means if you load a config file that is missing some things, they will automatically be added (provided that they use the new functions; I have *not* switched everything over to using them yet, mostly just using them for the launcher work now)
