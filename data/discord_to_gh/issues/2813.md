I don't know if this has been reported, but as the title states, When I click cancel on the doors dialog, it puts four walls on the screen and you can't undo it.

ok
this door shit is confusing af

...bleh. Best way to handle this is looking like rewriting a whole chunk of this code

...ok
this should be a lot better now
I not only fixed this bug
but several long-standing issues with this dialog

also, I added a `(None)` door type
which will not place any combos or overwrite anything
...and, while I was at it, a side of a room with a `(None)` door type won't do the auto-walk-into-the-room thing even in dungeon rooms.
