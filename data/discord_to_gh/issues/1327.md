Because the way ZC determines rotation axis for scripted draws is non-understandable bonkers. People had to resort to use bitmaps to do this.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 11:00

. . . ?
you provide a center point `cx, cy` to be the center of most draws
I wouldn't THINK it would be that hard to use.... but then again I pretty much never use rotation, so
gonna need to know what it is you want changed here though; which needs to include how it works now vs what is specifically wrong with that

```ffc script RotTest2{
    void run(){
        int origdata = this->Data;
        this->Data = 1;
        int cmb = ComboAt(this->X+8, this->Y+8);
        int w = this->TileWidth;
        int h = this->TileHeight;
        int cx = ComboX(cmb)+8;
        int cy = ComboY(cmb)+8;
        int counter = 0;
        while(true){
            counter++;
            Screen->DrawCombo(2, this->X, this->Y, origdata, w, h, this->CSet, -1, -1, cx, cy, counter, 0, 0, true, OP_OPAQUE);
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 11:24

Err, I think you want `this->X+8` not `ComboX(cmb)+8`
Because `this->X` is the draw x
Not `ComboX(cmb)`

=== @ Alucard648 01/06/2022 11:31

This script should cause left FFC to rotate  around solid combo in this test quest. The right FFC is desired result, achieved using bitmaps.

=== @ Alucard648 01/06/2022 11:32

Tried ComboX(cmb) and ComboY(cmb). Results in misplaced FFC, rotating at center point of scripted drawing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 11:36

script file?

=== @ Alucard648 01/06/2022 11:36

```ffc script RotTest2{
    void run(){
        int origdata = this->Data;
        this->Data = 1;
        int cmb = ComboAt(this->X+8, this->Y+8);
        int w = this->TileWidth;
        int h = this->TileHeight;
        int cx = ComboX(cmb)+8;
        int cy = ComboY(cmb)+8;
        int counter = 0;
        while(true){
            counter++;
            Screen->DrawCombo(2, ComboX(cmb)+8, ComboY(cmb)+8, origdata, w, h, this->CSet, -1, -1, cx, cy, counter, 0, 0, true, OP_OPAQUE);
            Waitframe();
        }
    }

. . . I really have never touched rotation enough to notice how fucking dogshit this is
my god
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) adding to thread

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 11:54

Even trying to steal ideas from the `MooshDrawTile` function, I can't quite seem to get it working right for this at all.... so this needs new logic, on a QR.... fun times.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 11:58

The rotation point should be the actual draw location
Which, appears to be right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 11:59

the script looks like it should be right
yet the draws do not be right
because DrawCombo rotation sucks ass

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 11:59

Oh
ohhhh
I see the problem loading the quest
What the actual fuck.
Honestly, this needs new logic yeah
this has always been awful and confusing to work with

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 12:01

UHHHH

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 12:02

We also need a way to have it default to centering on the tile's center if given certain arguments

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 12:02

Letting it run for long enough, THIS happened
which uh
guessing it had fun with a really large (or overflowed to negative?) value of `counter`....

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 12:04

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Honestly, should we have a new version of DrawCombo that does rotation better?
Cause I imagine having more arguments would be grand
For stuff like different rotation styles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 12:04

up to you

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 12:04

up to you, you mean ;P

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 12:04

nooo, I mean up to you
have fun

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 12:05

Fuck

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 12:06

@ Alucard648 more of a script error, but you should %= 360 for the counter
cause once it goes negative it freezes

=== @ Alucard648 01/06/2022 12:21

Update tests. Fixed counter overflow.

The same issue applies to DrawTile, Rectangle and Circle.
