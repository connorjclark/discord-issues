Additions to the spritedata class to allow for more advanced usage, such as by scripts, and for the simpler uses of bigger thrown object, spawn/death, and weapon/sparkle animations.

-Tiles X
-Tiles Y
-Offset X
-Offset Y

All imported older quests/empty data in New quests will have values of (1, 1, 0, 0) for this data. All four attributes should ideally be readable and writable as well.

Maybe we should add HitXOffset, HitYOffset, HitWidth and HitHeight plus the ability to edit this data in Sprite Editor for easier calibration.
