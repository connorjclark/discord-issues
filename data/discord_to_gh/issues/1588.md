ZC is crashing again when I go to start my quest after finishing opening screen wipe.

@ cbailey78 it most certainly does not do this to me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 18:53

including in a freshly-extracted separate folder of the build zip
so, it must be something you have done, or specific to your computer
or something is corrupt with some file
the only thing I can suggest is to redownload the build

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2022 20:24

Happening to me too

Happened after I added some of my tried and true scripts and updated the version of my quest

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2022 20:31

It happened both in regular and test mode as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 20:39

Happens in that quest for me, yep

wtf

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/02/2022 20:45

uhh
wait did I fuck something up there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 20:46

it's clearly calling that on enemies before they have spawned
and getting null enemy pointers
with no sanity check

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2022 20:46

Is that my script, or is that the engine?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 20:46

I don't know what you did here or what this is part of @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) so this is yours to fix
that's engine
I don't know how that looks at all like zscript
especially with the MSVC live debugger throwing an exception

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 20:48

I have absolutely no clue what's up with this code
there's a verison of the function that is NEVER CALLED? @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/02/2022 20:49

wait, no, I didn't touch this function; what
I made a new version called GuyHitFrom and used that, but I didn't touch the original GuyHit IIRC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 20:51

err
this function was last modified by me 2 years ago
when I retabbed it
so the function itself hasn't changed, what calls it must have

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 20:53

this is the only recent change, and it's by you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 20:54

....dammit deedee
there is a very important difference between `do {} while()` and `while ()`
```cpp
int32_t hit2 = -1;
do
{
    hit2 = diagonalMovement?GuyHitFrom(hit2+1,x+4,y+4,z,8,8,hzsz):GuyHit(hit2+1,x+7,y+7,z,2,2,hzsz);
    
    if(hit2!=-1)
    {
        if (hithero(hit2) == 0) return;
    }
} while (hit2 != -1);
```
So, what does this code do?
It sets `hit2` to `-1`
then it calls `GuyHit(0)`
err, hmm, well no, this needs to be a do-while.....
but
I see
you changed it from `GuyHit` with 6 params
which loops through every enemy and then does stuff with one when it finds it
to `GuyHit` with 7 params
which ASSUMES that the indexed enemy exists
and if no enemy exists, it... grabs the null pointer from `guys.spr(0)`
and derefs null
your `GuyHitFrom` also has this issue
both functions need to have a null check added
err, wait, no
your GuyHitFrom's for loop uses `guys.Count()`
so it should be fine
but
```cpp
int32_t GuyHit(int32_t index,int32_t tx,int32_t ty,int32_t tz,int32_t txsz,int32_t tysz,int32_t tzsz)
{
    enemy *e = (enemy*)guys.spr(index);
    
    if(e->hp > 0)
        return -1;
        
    bool d = e->dying;
    int32_t hc = e->hclk;
    e->dying = false;
    e->hclk = 0;
    bool hit = e->hit(tx,ty,tz,txsz,tysz,tzsz);
    e->dying = d;
    e->hclk = hc;
    
    return hit ? index : -1;
}```
that has no sanity check
it assumes the enemy must exist for the function to be being called
and you called it in an instance where that is unknown
(shall I fix it, or you got it?)
though err
this function doesn't seem AT ALL similar to `GuyHitFrom`
and it's called in 4-way movement
(which, yep, that's the thing; only 4-way movement quests will crash)
Did you test this at all to make sure the stomp boots actually work right in 4-way? @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
because you're calling an entirely separate function for 4-way

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 21:03

I can fix the crash, but I have no clue if the stomp boots will work at all with that fix
so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 21:04

or, wait
is the second function call just meant to be GuyHitFrom?
is that just the issue?
that's probably just the issue
should have it fixed
gotta love 4-letter typos

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/02/2022 21:17

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "to `GuyHit` with 7 params"): OH FUCK, that second GuyHit needs to be a GuyHitFrom

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 21:18

Yeeep
That's what I did

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/02/2022 21:19

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Did you test this at all to m…"): uh, no I did not, because I am a moron (actually I didn't realize that was a diagonal movement only block <:facepalm:790712840683520050> )

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2022 21:20

It uses diagonalMovement in the same line you call the functions lol

=== @ cbailey78 05/02/2022 21:25

ZC works now! Thank you very much!

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒ZC crashes after starting your quest

Looks fixed
