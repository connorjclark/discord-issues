A QR that prevents appearing/disappearing and phasing Wizzrobes from flickering during those animations. This allows for more complex animation possibilities and a flickering effect can still be achieved even with the rule on by alternating filled and blank tiles. This is meant to be used with New Enemy Tiles because of the unique frames used by Wizzrobe animations with that rule on. I don't really care about this borking Old Enemy Tiles Wizzrobes.
