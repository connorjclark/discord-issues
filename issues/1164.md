Ok so the red/fiery Gleeok heads block all projectiles on the NES, similar to a Darknut's front. This includes
-Sword Beams
-Boomerangs
-Arrows (makes tink sprite too)
-Wand magic (produces fire too, if Book is had)
Not sure if this would be a bug report or feature request, considering that it involves adding a new Gleeok attribute and QR, but it's technically a bug compared to NES Zelda.
Not to mention that the... possible usage of Gleeok heads to spawn Book fire is fascinating
I can provide video proof if needed. Have a savestate

I would suggest making this an enemy rule.  This would break compatibility in certain quests
But interesting note

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 19:59

yeah the way (most?) enemy qrs work is that they turn on enemy rules
like dodongo cset 8->cset dodongo/digdogger fix is just telling the zc player to make dodongos cset dodongo/digdogger instead of 8
or rope 2s don't flash tells the zc player to turn flashing off for rope 2s and set the cset to 8 (9 in older versions, which is a compatibility issue)
(replying to @ NightmareJames "I would suggest making this a…"): and all pre-existing quests would have it off anyways, though we'd need to update the nth quests

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 20:02

bugfixes generally don't mess with extant quests; even in 2.50.2, which had a lot of bugfixes that messed with extant quests, it still kept 1.84/1.90 quest dodongos as cset 8 instead of cset dodongo/digdogger
so that they'd look like what they did to the questmaker and in the 1.84/1.90 zc players
and for instance if side tektites can be bugfixed it'll probably be a rule as well, and extant quests will still have boomeranging tektites

i wonder... could fiery gleeok heads be set to be shielded, while the green gleeok heads aren't?
that would block sword beams and keep all their current immunities
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
i'm unsure if fiery gleeok heads are their own spawned enemies, a la how moldorms and lanmolas each spawn 5 enemies
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i wonder... could fiery gleeo…"): so if they are, refer to this

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 20:09

wait yeah... patras DO have code to shield/block all themselves state-dependently, so refer to that
~~getting awful, awful ideas for moldorms and lanmolas whose only unshielded pieces are the currently-first or last ones~~

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 11:23

@ P-Tux7 Do they make the *chink* sound when they hit? if so, is it just projectiles, or does the sword and etc also make the sound?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 13:43

(meta) thread name was changed: 💊🔓NES Fiery Gleeok Heads block all blockable projectiles
added an enemy flag

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 13:51

just projectiles iirc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 13:52

okay, good

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 13:53

oh i should mention that the boomerang comes back, sorry
as though it had hit a darknut or pols voice

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 13:55

yeah, I figured
question though: if the boomerang comes back *through* a gleeok head, does it still make the chink sound?
Or only if it hits it on the initial trip out?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 13:56

i'll check but presumably the constant string of blocked sounds a la the aforementioned enemies

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 14:07

okay, so I shouldn't have to change anything hopefully

Ok so this works perfectly except for not making a sound when blocking bombs!
Thanks a ton!

=== @ P-Tux7 02/14/2022 21:28

Ok, so I PERSONALLY don't care about this, but it turns out that in NES Z1 the sounds made are
1. Every frame while the weapon is colliding with the head
2. Use the "enemy death" sound instead of the "tink" sound

I guess this is because of that behaviour where, similar to Dungeon Man/Goriya, Manhandla cores and Patra cores when invincible, the Fiery Gleeok Head is not actually invincible. It is just resurrected every frame if it "shouldn't" be dead.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/14/2022 21:30

Except for the bomb thing I'd call this one dead and done. Patras in ZC actually don't have that sound quirk either IIRC, and I've never found that odd

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:03

They should make a sound when blocking bombs
I also did a thing with manhandla cores with a compat qr where hitting the center body doesn't make the hit sound
