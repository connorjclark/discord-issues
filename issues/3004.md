Problem: combos are missing frames of animation. Build 30 of 3.0


idk what step of the chain is causing it, might be an off-by-one error again ( vaguely remember a separate animation issue happening before). 

Dmap 1, Screen 0x12 (18) 

Just walk over to the campfire on the right and press A. I slowed the animation of the smoke ring expanding on purpose.

I have empty combos that Copycat trigger -16 into the smoke animation which then cycles into blank combos.

=== @ Majora 01/22/2024 17:14

the animation is supposed to be 10 frames (9 of them visible, only the final frame completely blank) but only 4 appear

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 18:09

@ Moosh did you mention copycat was broken?

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 18:10

I don't think so? This isn't ringing a bell

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 18:11

Oh you said copycset, whatever that is

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 18:11

oh yeah, that's a ZScript function. Still gotta  get on that one

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 22:36

@ Majora what in the combo editor for the campfire combo spawns the smoke?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 22:38

I see, it's the top half, was looking at bottom.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 22:40

The animation in the preview is wrong in the same way.

yup

Is this checked?

also, can you screenshot the tile layout for me?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 22:43

it was not. I checked it, and they both look the same in the editor.
it starts on the cursor...

er, didnt show
first column, second row is the starting Tile
so the "invalid"/blank one is the animation start

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 22:47

. . . the fuck, that's set up correctly...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 22:55

Isn't A.Frames too high?
I traced it, and it wraps under to the next row (the underside of the smoke cloud)
since it was defined to have 10 frames
so I think it's actually rendering as it should, just not in the combo selector pane?
oooh skipy should make it go to that second bit of clouds
in combo editor preview, it ends up here instead

(bottom right)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 22:58

....that seems like the preview isn't respecting `A.Skip Y` at all

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 22:59

It's the same for the engine no matter the value of that QR you mentioned.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 23:01

...what about `New Combo Animation`?
....which, yeah, that.... oof
thats probably it
(that should need to be checked)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 23:02

i see it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 23:02

(....and REALLY should've been a compat rule for `Old Combo Animation` in hindsight....)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 23:02

> tileToDraw += rowdiff*(data[TileFrame::tfr_skipy]);

should be * TILES_PER_ROW

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 23:03

ah, yeah, true, the combo anim rule wouldn't affect the preview, so its 2 separate issues here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 23:04

gotta add these qrs in the preview frame too
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "(....and REALLY should've bee…"): can we do that now?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 23:05

Keep in mind zscript can technically access these, so inverting it is... bleh
(yes, might break that if people used it via zscript, though, I see no damn reason for someone to toggle that rule via zscript, so realistically its probably fine)
...can you confirm that that is the fix though? on second look I'm not so sure
because actually, broken askip y rule looks like it has no effect unless that's *off*? which seems... odd

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 23:09

New Combo Animations is already on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 23:23

ok what the fuck then

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 23:24

lol didnt realize combos cycle even if not on screen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 23:31

so in the preview tile widget, the skipy is not added to the tile variable, it is only added to a temporary
in the engine animate function, it is added to the cdata.tile
```cpp
if(int32_t rowoffset = TILEROW(cdata.tile)-TILEROW(cdata.o_tile))
{
    cdata.tile += cdata.skipanimy * rowoffset * TILES_PER_ROW;
}
```

is fired every frame after it starts
until it resets
so it just keeps applying the skipanimy more than once

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 23:32

....ohhhh fuck
I know I tested this thoroughly originally.... I wonder what change happened that broke it?
or was I just that stupid and no one reported this until now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 23:32

This probably means all large animations with New Combo Animations never worked, so don't think this needs a new QR.
Or just any animation that happened to wrap around a tile page row.
we should also try to share the same animation code between engine, and all places in the editor (preview widget, the combo selector, whatever elsE)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 23:34

...nope, I'm apparently just that stupid

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 23:34

so we don't have three places for bugs to appear

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 23:34

The problem is that the tile animation frame
isn't just for combos\
so it has code shared with combo animation, and code shared with item animation, as both of those use it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 23:36

(it has skipx/skipy from combos, delay from items... and it apparently doesn't have item flash CSet, which, is an oversight in the item editor preview, and should be added)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 23:37

but can they all use a common function, like `advance_animation(int& tile, int& frame, int o_tile, int num_frames, int skipx, int skipy)`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 23:38

something like that
I'm not sure how to fix the engine animation so I'll just push the fix to the preview widget.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 01:42

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "```cpp

....it assigns `cdata.tile` right before that
so it wouldn't be applied more than once, would it?

ugh then no idea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 01:57

just made my own test in whatever build I had built (2.55, maybe a week or two old) and it appeared to work fine...
(in zc, the preview in the combo editor was still fucked)
building main now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 02:22

so @ Majora's animation in engine disappears on tile 27856 (the 5th frame). it cuts off early. It otherwise plays all the right frames.
> I have empty combos that Copycat trigger -16 into the smoke animation which then cycles into blank combos.

not sure how this plays into things

=== @ Majora 01/31/2024 02:24

Just threw it in for completeness sake

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 02:24

I traced the animate fn and this combo still cycles into the right tiles!
it just is not being rendered...

=== @ Majora 01/31/2024 02:26

This is why nerds scripting all the shit is bad. Cuz then morons like me have to deal with basic engine things being broken. <:screamingcat:1134153144192991365>

....because combo cycling uses YET ANOTHER COPY OF THE SAME FUCKING CODE
at least the checking stuff
that... doesn't look like it accounts for *either* skip?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 02:35

can use combocheck instead?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 02:36

combocheck might need something for new combo animation for that to work? unsure. (combocheck is currently specifically called when new animation is off)
...hmm, I mean
I guess all it would need is to ignore the `broken askip y` rule if the new animation rule is ALSO on?
because the check after that does look correct
This also, uh, almost certainly needs a compat rule, because I'm guessing this would have been broken for a while
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "just made my own test in what…"): ^ This would make more sense then too
because I didn't test with cycling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 02:39

...also like
this same check
occurs 5 separate fucking times
in the same function

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 02:40

this fixed it
👍

good to know
that's fucking neat
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "This also, uh, almost certain…"): ^
My expectation given where this code is is that this was probably broken for literally ever

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 02:44

...yep, just confirmed the bug is present in 2.50.2

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 02:46

Wouldn't the only behavior if we didn't add a compat to keep this bug, be that combo animations continue to get cut short (if they use the skipping mechanism)?
Previously the quest author likely just saw it look OK in the editor, like Majora did, and didnt' catch it live.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 02:47

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Wouldn't the only behavior if…"): it isn't just animations
it's also the combo's physical properties like solidity, damage, etc

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 02:48

in any case, it would look one way in the editor ---
i don't see a quest author relying on how it looked in engine instead

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 02:48

point being it could break old quests

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 02:48

I''m running replays to learn more.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 02:48

like, it could theoretically make something inaccessible that was fine before
because of a timing difference
or could make a 2.10 style bossfight be a different difficulty (easier? harder? not sure) (not actually one MADE in 2.10, since askip wasn't a thing yet afaik, but if someone made that STYLE of fight in a later version)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 02:49

I'm just weary of adding in a compat QR without more data - which bakes in a bug for all quests today, when possibly we could be fixing the bug instead.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 02:49

I suppose that's fair

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 02:49

not to mention added complexity forever
tho minor in this case.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 02:50

Either way the number of quests that are likely to experience this is probably extremely low

You OK with deferring on a QR until someone lets us know it broke a quest?
pending assessing these replays
maybe that will tell us right away

if it passes replays, sure

but will need to separate gfx differences from "yeah, this was a key timing mechanic of some crazy boss fight"

TODO:

- make editor preview widget respect the skipy QR, and new combo animation too (rather, it being off)
and new combo animation too (rather, it being off)

does making qr_NEW_COMBO_ANIMATION a compat qr just mean it will get enabled when people say "Yes" to the bug prompt dialog on loading in new version?
I see it is already on by default in new quest.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "does making qr_NEW_COMBO_ANIM…"): it means it will be *disabled*, which is why the behavior would need to be inverted
it's right for the default quest, though that's specific to `default.qst` (unlike the compat rules which are fixed by `File->New` regardless), and won't help when people use old tilesets
being a compat rule helps old tilesets due to saying "yes" to the bug prompt dialog

only one replay failed, and it seems an improvement? https://tmp-zc-cycle-change.surge.sh/
