Both the screen going dark and playing the whistle cause the screen wavy to freak out for the duration of the screen freeze. Has been a thing for a while with dark stuff, but just noticed the whistle part of it recently. It's in the september 20th nightly, wouldn't be surprised if it's in the latest too.
