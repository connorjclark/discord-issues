Apologies if this has already been requested, but I was wanting to request enemy knockback as a feature.

The idea is that take a darknut for instance. Darknuts probably wouldn't realistically get knocked back by sword as like a keese.

Furthermore, with enemies drowning in water being a thing, enemy knockback could be used to make that harder.

Bonus points if you could alter the knockback the enemy experiences based on weapons.

Scripts can access scripted knockback via new npc-> commands

the darknut thing isn't even scripted
you'd just set whatever npc flag determines knockback to 0 via npc script
as usual removing is easier than adding
