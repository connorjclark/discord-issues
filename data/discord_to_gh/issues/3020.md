For some reason, random screens crash when going onto. When you load from ZQ onto the screen, it immediately closes ZQ. If you start from another and go onto it, it crashes too. It seems to only be a few select screens. I've tried to remove certain things from them, but no avail.

Okay, I seem to have found a way around it/found the bug? I changed the region from 1 to 2. Wtf
