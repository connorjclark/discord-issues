In Large Mode, the scroll wheel scrolls one combo at a time. Pain. It should be configurable, or at least bumped up!

Imagine working with 5k combos. Very painful, even with bookmarks.

(to be fair, pgup/pgdn skips a lot)

I usually use mouse scroll and some combination of SHIFT and ALT and/or CTRL (only 2 of these scroll extra fast, holding 2 at once scrolls to the top or bottom of the whole combo list <:kekw:820115662089355296> )
