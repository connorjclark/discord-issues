(This is what I recently tried to fix that needed to be reverted @connorjclark (discord: connorclark))

A lens with the 6th flag (`Triggers Lens Trigflag`) checked makes enemies invisible. This is because some old code (which was NOT reflected in the item editor with any named flag to indicate this behavior). Any code referencing the `ITEM_FLAG6` or `ITEM_FLAG7` of a lens type item (present in several places in guys.cpp at minimum) is *wrong* and needs to be removed- excluding the couple of places that specifically check `ITEM_FLAG6` with relation to combo triggers, which match the item editor name of the flag.

Apparently me trying to fix this broke like hell and I was unable to debug it due to technical issues, so, uh, someone else should probably handle this.

....turns out it wasn't this change that had issues, it was the FFC changer thing
and just applying this change appears to be passing replays
