okay so amend that to csets 0-13 since zoria said he enabled using them for combos in the newest alphas
one or both of them get overwritten by the boss palette for enemies that use an extra sprite palette, but that shouldn't be a problem if one just never uses that option

This'll be a tremendous amount of work
So, I'll get around to attempting it when I have the requisite energy

Dimi's done great work so far. Is she up to it?
Emily — 08/08/2021
Maybe, but IDK how much experience with palette stuff she has
Meanwhile the literal second thing I did in ZC was tint

@Timelord i should mention we also could use this for outlands module, the NES equivalent of csets 7 and 8 are different in dungeons on the NES version

Okay so as for the Z3 tileset, let's compare how the palette changes outside Link's house and inside his house in the original game
Outside

Inside

That appears to be six tile CSets that change per-area, and about one CSet's worth of sprite CSets that change (though given that they seem to be for "things that look like tiles that are actually sprites", such as lifted pots, rocks, and bushes, they might be able to be conflated into 6 per-level CSets. Still, at least 6 per area)
P-Marx7 — 08/15/2021
@Timelord you want a z3 tileset here's something for you to do
the secrets->nextcombo flag that emily added without your permission and the triggers secrets combo trigger attribute dimi added without your permission is also doing wonders for that tileset too by the way
now i can just make a 2x2 rock alias, set it to be bomb-triggerable, and have the ->next combos be the staircase, so the zquest user can place all that in one click without needing to place flags or set the screen's secret combos
that's why i made #lttp-rips and have been updating it the past few days
even set up a goriya enemy's big enemy tiles and screenshotted the correct enemy size parameters if you want a preview of what the tileset will be like once the more csets thing is sorted out```

Yeah this is out of date since apparently it's just back to csets 0-11 now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/27/2021 21:51

aye, that was an error on zoria's part
csets above 11 are used for hardcoded shit
and should never be available for combos

i should also mention that don't feel compelled to do this any time soon
given that once i get over covid my attention will be drawn to a custom tileset which doesn't need this

=== @ P-Tux7 10/04/2021 16:14

i should mention that due to this taking up 12 csets in each DPal
this will necessarily disable manual dark rooms, interpolated fading only
