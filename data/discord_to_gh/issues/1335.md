In 5th quest, the traps use the "blank" tile, and also using the name JEAN apparently wants to load the 4th.qst

also same for that quest incidentally
with the traps

=== @ tim 01/09/2022 03:40

trap tile errors also confirmed in other quests

=== @ P-Tux7 01/09/2022 03:40

i thought i had just messed something up with combining all these builds

(replying to @ DergerSwerson "In 5th quest, the traps use t‚Ä¶"): `JEAN` should load `classic_5th.qst`, which is the fourth quest in the module (as 3rd was removed)

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 06:28

a theory to check tomorrow - traps that don't use New Enemy Tiles not reading the correct tile...?
or perhaps a flaw with the Animation Style they get set to and are using as their "Old Anim. Style" by default in the enemy editor

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 06:29

though if non-animated Guys still display properly and don't use tile 0, that may not be it, because IIRC them and Traps use the same Old Style animation

I think this might actually be fixed, but I need to check

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 15:54

The traps issue is fixed, and Jean is *trying* to load the correct quest.
Now to get the stench of 5th quest off of me.
(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîì5th Quest - Traps are bugged out(and wrong quest loaded)

Looks fine if I set a Corner Trap room in 1st and test it. However, I don't know if this accounts for old quests with traps because I'm not even sure where the closest location in Z1 that HAS traps is to test the original old quests
At the very least this confirms that importing and re-saving old quests does not have any issue with trap graphics.

=== @ tim 02/15/2022 05:50

bow room in level 1

=== @ P-Tux7 02/15/2022 22:00

Ok they work perfectly in un-resaved 1st quest too

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:00

confirmed fixed?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/16/2022 04:01

i'll try 5th tomorrow but most likely
if anyone can point me to where a level with traps is in that quest i'd be grateful

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:03

They're in level 1
but uh, my condolences if you play it, I don't think the quest is very good.
