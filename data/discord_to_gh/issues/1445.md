In the Triggers tab of the Combo editor, a "Trigger->Next" flag (at the bottom with the other two trigger flags)

Also maybe a Trigger->Previous flag too (that greys out ->Next so you can't choose both)

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒Trigger-Next flag
#deleted-channel (has ->Next and ->Prev)
(if both are checked, it just does `->Next`, ignoring `->Prev`)
