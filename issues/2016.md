I have no fucking clue what's wrong here but after pulling I can't build at all

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 17:41

Can you try clearing everything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 17:41

as in, redo the entire thing from scratch?
that was a clean build

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 17:42

Which target fails
Try building png or zlib
Debug or release

that's a full `Rebuild Solution` output
seems to be mostly this?

that whole error like, at least a dozen times

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 17:46

That error sounds like you don't have write permission hmmm
Try making those directories manually
It should be under _deps folder

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 17:49

see those -src suffix folder up top?
Make one for zlib
It where git is trying to clone to
Idk why it doesn't work anymore for you, it did in the past for the other external projects fetched by git

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 17:50

so `zlib-src` in `_deps`?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 17:50

Yeah
https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/22628
Same error here

creating that didn't help

...oh
because

it `rm -rf`'s that directory
before it clones
so
creating it does nothing as the script just deletes it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:00

Anything good in the cmake error log or output log?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 18:01

not that I can see

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:01

Try commenting out the zlib fetch in the cmake and just build png (I wanna see if png has same error)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 18:02

what cmake version

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:04

3.24 is needed for `FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS` in that `FetchContent_Declare` command but 1) you dont have these libs on windows system so that shouldnt matter 2) i'd expect cmake to just ignore args it didnt know about
but...
maybe 2) is wrong
comment out those two lines real quick and see what happens
`FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS NAMES ZLIB` etc.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:06

The most confusing part here is why the heck does github's windows machines work fine
The above is a fresh build?
I have no idea what a mid-updgraded cmake cache folder would do
(rm CMakeFiles and CMakeCache.txt is enough for clean build I believe. _deps to be safe)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:35

https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/49da6ec95d04967d949ea125bfc8fac74e652b5d#diff-1e7de1ae2d059d21e1dd75d5812d5a34b0222cef273b7c3a2af62eb747f9d20aL215-L216

Try restoring these two lines. I found I needed them gone for the build to work on github...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 18:40

seems to have changed nothing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:45

my last resort is gonna be making the png/zlib support optional for a local build 😢

another option is to install these libraries onto your windows system, so our cmake build just skips the download and uses prebuild binaries. Here's a page for libpng. I have no idea how involved this would be. https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libpng.htm "Binaries" link has png libs, and "Deps" link has zlib lib, and assumedly the "Installation instructions" are how you install these things in a way Cmake will find them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 18:46

err wait
I just did another full clean build and it did something different
wtf

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:47

Yea those are the exact errors github had before I removed those 2 extra lines I told you to add back.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 18:47

...ahk.
fun

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:47

mismatch in binaries being build for static/shared
b/c `add_compile_options` / non-target-specific cmake stuff is way too brittle

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 18:49

but like, this builds on github just fine??
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) can you pull master and build and see if it functions?
if it builds right for Deedee I have an idea

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:50

wild idea, try doing the build from the command line in an admin-priv console

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 18:51

.....I understand some of those words

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:51

`cmake . && cmake --build . --config Release`
right click windows cmd / whatever and choose open as admin
This just calls msvc but
the idea is to give yourself permissions (since the issue seemed related to "I can't make a folder")

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 18:52

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "if it builds right for Deedee…"): Should be able to given I just merged from it yesterday

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:53

er, no
shit, gimme a sec

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 18:58

Yeah it compiles fine for me
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) skill issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 18:59

no, what I'm guessing
is msvc2019 issue
bleh

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 18:59

oh, you're still using that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 19:00

yeah I never took the time to do the whole upgrading msvc thing
why would I

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 19:00

that's like using 2008 <:Ohoho:859125136672948237>

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 19:00

....how so
what benefit does the newer one have

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 19:00

lol
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "wild idea, try doing the buil…"): ...so fun thing
I decided to try in a non-admin cmd first
......and that compiled successfully.
<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> time to update msvc I suppose

fuck

said it worked

it's still broke for me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:02

????

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:02

I get a giant list of 17 not compiled

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:02

how the fuck

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:02

So that change was just inlining a variable. It no way fixed anything.

I think it was some mix of upgrading and clearing the right folders

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:02

is that possible
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "So that change was just inlin…"): you changed it to build statically

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:02

Deedee delete your cache

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:02

it was previously generating `.dll` instead of `.lib`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:02

It was static before tho, see the variable it replaced

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:02

...huh
clearly something is wrong with that variable then

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:03

How do I delete the cache?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:03

`CMakeCache.txt`, `CMakeFiles` (folder)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:03

depends on how you configure your build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:03

delete

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:03

Easy way is delete the build folder.
Hard way is go find all the build shit added to the root folder

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:03

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Easy way is delete the build…"): ?
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "`CMakeCache.txt`, `CMakeFiles…"): ^ would it not just be this?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:04

When you configure a cmake build you select a build folder. As I can tell, you have been configuring it to be the root folder. This is called an in-source build.

The more modern approach is to set it to a folder named "build" which is where everything build generated will live
yeah but like _deps is a thing
And maybe other stuff
Release/
Debug/

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:06

`Rebuild Solution`
clears all that for you

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:06

So question; what's the easiest way to delete my entire folder and re-get all the files back?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:06

git clean -fxd
Then run cmake gui

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:08

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "clears all that for you"): This clears build artifacts (the end result) but probably not cmake configuration stuff (any caches, could be more than cmakecach.txt depending on the cmake file)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:08

fuck I need to figure out how to use non-smartgit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:08

just start deleting anything with cmake in it that isn't source.controlled lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:08

just
open the git bash
and type `git clean -fdx`
literally 1 command
(you really should learn non-smartgit)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:09

yeah but git bash isn't open on the right project

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:09

(it's far better than that crap you use)
?
what do you mean?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:09

I search up git bash and open it
then what?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:09

no no no
you right click
git bash here
in the repo folder

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:10

you gotta learn to live in the terminal
It makes life easier long term

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:10

if you don't have that then you installed it wrong
...which, given that that is a *default* setting, would be impressive

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:10

that still left a bunch of files after doing that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:11

what did it leave?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:11

the icons
some deps

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:11

those are part of the repo
so yes
it would

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:11

ohh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:11

that deletes things that are NOT part of the repo
so, the msvc and cmake shit
it's as though you just pulled the repo into that folder
anything that would not be pulled as part of the repo is cleared

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:12

forgot the cmake stuff; is it x64 I want to configure with or 32?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:12

x64
...I mean, you can do 32, but

cmake errors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:13

it's just a question of which one of those you're working on locally
...what errors?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:13

same error I was getting in VS

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:14

what is your cmake version
should show in the title bar of the cmake gui

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:14

3.22.0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:15

update cmake
you missed that part of the discussion earlier
3.24 is required at minimum
3.24.3 is latest release

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:15

emily did you get 3.24 or a 3.25 pre-release?
I'll bump minimum to 3.24 in the CMakeList.txt after deedee updates

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:16

https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.24.3/cmake-3.24.3-windows-x86_64.msi
that
3.24.3
is what I got

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 20:18

is there a problem getting 3.25?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:19

got a time machine?
not out yet 🙂
just beta version so
I'd avoid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:20

yeah, that'd be the only problem, it isn't a full release yet

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:38

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) confirm if/when you get this working, you can just mark the report closed+fixed

getting this error
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:45

Try building png target, tell me what the output.
That error is very strange.
but suggests you can't build `png`.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 23:47

building png says it's already built
``1>------ Build started: Project: allegro_image, Configuration: Debug x64 ------
1>png.c`` the thing that failed was allegro_image

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:52

in the cmake gui...try setting `WANT_IMAGE_PNG` to off
We don't need a5's png support
we bring our own
no idea why they can't find the libpng headers but w.e.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:54

oh i know why
try...
this...
`set(PNG_INCLUDE_DIR "${png_SOURCE_DIR}" "${png_BINARY_DIR}")`
put that right after `PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS` declaration in CMakeList.txt
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "oh i know why"): Don't know why it wasn't missing _for me_ when building allegro_image, but a5 uses this other cmake var to set png headers...
some older projects weren't consistent on naming conventions. this is one of those "old" variables. see https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPNG.html#obsolete-variables ...
and I failed to set it when building libpng from source.
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "put that right after `PNG_INC…"): Tell me if this works, then I'll do some other stuff and push the fix.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 00:25

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "in the cmake gui...try settin…"): this worked, trying the cmake fix now
sorry, been distracted and tired past few hours

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 00:28

Okay, that fixed it
should I push the cmakelists change @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 00:30

You did my edit suggestion _with_ WANT_IMAGE_PNG still on?
No, I'll push some changes real soon + some more, just a minute.
I'm gonna force that option to OFF (b/c we don't need a5 png handling) and also fix the png include dir variable too, just because.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 00:34

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "You did my edit suggestion _w…"): No, I turned it off
I can imagine a timeline where I would have left it on though
I can merge my scaling changes in now, though I can't compile to test if the merge works
otherwise, ping me when you're done so I can merge it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 00:38

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "No, I turned it off"): Well the cmake suggestion was to make the a5 image addon build, but if the option is off it doesn't affect anything

It's on by default no idea why it never fails for me or emily :/

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 00:38

er
I tried it with it off
sorry, mixing up words
I turned it off, it fixed it, I turned it back on and did your suggestion, that too fixed it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 00:39

Oh yay
Ya we got mixed up there lol
Thanks for checking
