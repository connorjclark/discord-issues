Adding extra formatting options for zscript to read values as binary
Basically, adding
```0b```
to go with the hexadecimal formatting of
```0x```
Similar for Octs could also be good?
so
```0b100```
would compile as binary 4, or whatnot.

interestingly, `0b` is what C++ uses
not sure why ZC didn't follow that
should be doable, but, probably gonna wait until I'm done with all the current string editor shite

that's fine
it's not exactly a priority
but it did trip me up

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíbinary formatting alternative

and `0o` prefix for octal as well
