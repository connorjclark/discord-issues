On Mac, when I press command to use the A item and press any direction key at the same time, Link will continuously walk in that direction until I press option and the direction he's walking in.

Happens as old at A108 (didn't check earlier.

doesn't need any key bound to CMD, happens regardless.

I shared this in allegro discord

> This may be an allegro issue or an OSX issue... but I don't get keyup events for any keys at all if CMD is held down. I added logging to _al_osx_keyboard_handler keybd.m and confirmed that there just isn't any event send if CMD is down. This is directly from keyDown:(NSEvent*) so it seems like an OSX issue, but maybe there's a way to opt into better key events?
