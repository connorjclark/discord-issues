For easier drawing lines  and rectangles as sown in screenshot.

So this idea...I like in theory. There is a serious case of control bloat going on in the main editor GUI to the point where I don't think we have many good button combinations to spare. Would probbaly require some pretty major editor reworks that I am sure not volunteering for right now. But this and floating selections are definitely on my radar

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 10:20

^ I would use an rclick menu of some sort to change brush types
rather than a hotkey, due to control bloat
(....and you can always add a hotkey with default `Unbound`, so users can customize if they like)

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:21

That could work, though I find the right click menu already to be kinda bloated itself

...`Brush Settings` is a thing
...mm, though that already has a bunch....

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:22

My thought, and you may not be happy to hear this, is that with editor UI space once again being a limit, we may once again want to return to the 1.90-2.10 days when this whole lower section was an alternating panel of features

Just with features that are better grouped than before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 10:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): You could probably move `Set Fill Type` inside `Brush Settings`- who uses that anyway?
and then just replace it with `Brush Type >` `Normal, Line, Rect,`
(replying to @ Moosh "My thought, and you may not b…"): ...this uh, already exists in compact mode as an option
required to make font sizes larger for accessibility, requested specifically

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:24

Does it? huh
shows how often I use compact mode 😛

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:25

Anyways, my thought would be that one of those panels would be various combo tools. Ctrl+ click could be accessed with a paint bucket tool, right click to swap fill types. Alt could be an eyedropper tool. And then new tools as well like line and rectangle
Hotkeys would still work same as always

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 10:26

Keep in mind that in compact mode, you have about this much area to work with in the panel:

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:26

But it'd reduce the overall amount of memorization required and provide a visual alternative while also allowing for additional tools

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 10:27

...and it would like, require using the panel
which is a pain
that people might not like
so, panel needs to stay optional, obviously

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:28

Panel would save clicks in the long run though

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:29

If tools that you need for screen design were grouped together and more niche tools (warps, items) were grouped together, you could do things in passes. It'd be the same number of clicks as the right click menu at the worst, significantly fewer at the best

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 10:29

aye, of course, which gives good reason for users to want to use the panels
gotta leave the non-panel option though for people who'll be picky and complain
(though could probably swap it so panel mode is the default)

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:31

I guess the tools could also be buried in the right click menu. It would be nice to have hotkeys too but we simply don't have enough comfortable buttons. Ctrl, alt, and shift are all taken and can be used in combination with each other
well I don't think alt can, but the other two combine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 10:31

(replying to @ Moosh "I guess the tools could also…"): again, bindable hotkeys can be defaulted to unbound
that doesn't work for like ctrl/shift/alt modifiers on clicking
but you could allow people to bind a button to `Switch to line tool`
or a button to `Cycle tool`

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:32

I don't think combo brush hotkeys are bindable currently, are they? Becuase they're hold inputs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 10:32

the ctrl/alt/shift are hold inputs on click, so not hotkeys
and you would want to keep that behavior, same way I have it in the tile editor

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:33

Oh I see what you mean

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 10:33

(ctrl/alt work in the tile editor for floodfill/dropper tools, exactly as we're talking about)

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 10:33

Little awkward, but it works I suppose

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 10:33

(and are held hotkeys)
(meanwhile 1-9 in the tile editor)
(are 'swap to that number tool' hotkeys, IIRC)
the held ones are good for shorcuts, because like
if you swap to a dropper tool.... how often are you not going to IMMEDIATELY swap to something else?
so alt as a hold for that is perfect, because it auto-swaps-back on release
(which, the idea here then being, ctrl or alt would still do floodfill/dropper, *regardless of what tool you have equipped*)
(or, well, exceptions can be made if needed, ex. selection tools in tile editor don't allow ctrl/alt I beieve)
(OH, and in the tile editor, `Ctrl+Alt` is `Replace All`, the wand tool)
(you could probably add that to combos as a new held combination as well?)

=== @ Alucard648 09/20/2023 07:59

What about new drawing mode that uses normal combo palette, but allows drawing lines/rectangles? As for "too many drawing modes": right click on drawing mode cycler button opens menu with all available drawing modes.
