An imitation of the Z1 Passageway (fade to black and back out) wipe added to the Warps menu. This is inspired by the WarpEx function discussion, so it would be easier to add a wipe so that any warp can imitate Z1 passageways than to fix that bug.
(meta) thread name was changed: Warp Wipe Type - Quick Fade

. . . what?
How does... a fade out.... fix screen 80 not working?

=== @ P-Tux7 06/15/2023 22:30

It doesn't, but it means that you can simulate Screen 80s/81s on normal screens
Or if you just want to make more than one type of passageway and cellar per map

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 22:40

....is fade through black not already an option??

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 22:42

and... I mean.... "To fix the issue of Screen 80/81 not working with WarpEx, make it so people can just not use those" is a completely back-asswards way to solve a problem

=== @ P-Tux7 06/15/2023 23:17

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....is fade through black not…"): Nope!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 23:18

...I'm pretty sure it's an opening wipe type
...and actually
I'm pretty sure the fade on passageway warps is just the fade that happens when you warp to a dmap with a different palette
because, the screen 80 screens use hardcoded palettes

=== @ P-Tux7 06/15/2023 23:22

oh, that makes sense
but it'd still be nice to have a fade to black option

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 23:23

new warp shit is painful to add
so, not really a priority

=== @ P-Tux7 06/15/2023 23:23

wait
what about fading to black for warping pitfalls
like lttp?

=== @ P-Tux7 06/15/2023 23:25

i'm just saying it has precedent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 23:25

yeah it's just painful

=== @ P-Tux7 06/15/2023 23:26

understandable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 23:26

and, like, there's more painful stuff on the todo list
....but the result of that pain will be far more than "hey warps fade to black now"
because to handle this
I need to edit the warp type dropdown listers to include new warp type options
I need to edit the warping code both in `dowarp()` in `hero.cpp` (used for normal warps) and `warp_player()` in `ffscript.cpp` (used for WarpEx, Magic Mirrors, SCC warps)

=== @ P-Tux7 06/16/2023 01:43

oh goddamn, ouch

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/16/2023 01:44

yeah, "add new warp thing" is just super not worthwhile
and it's not like I can be all like "time to rewrite this system!"
because it's not only so jank, but so entrenched in compat bullshit
