very much something corrupted
Just pushed a branch
(going to merge once it passes checks, regardless of this fullscreen issue)
but if you could take a look at this at some point @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

...present before my branch, just tested

there's still corruption here even after my a5 stuff was reverted, for the record

still a problem?

something must have fixed it at some point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/27/2023 02:23

always fun when that plan works out
