I'm not entirely sure the cause of this issue, nor how to properly replicate it fully.
Storing an object to the pointer causes this error:

(once)
moving the declaration point of the array causes a change in the pointer number it tries to pass (the number that the error code prints)

moving the declaration point up causes the different error code. 

This should likely not matter

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/19/2023 19:47

I feel like that this *shouldn't* happen just from moving the variable. And when testing with new classes I could not replicate this behaviour of being unable to write to an array of objects.

something super specific is probably going wrong here
will probably require a lot of debugging... <:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/19/2023 20:06

hmmm

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/19/2023 21:00

idle thought: I don't know why it would do so on this case. But the error might suggest that it's trying to change the array index, rather than using the index?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2023 21:11

(bump)
so this is still happening in latest @ Lunaria ?

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/10/2023 21:11

it was for moosh
er, sort of

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2023 21:12

if you can recreate a simple testcase that would be greatly helpful

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/10/2023 21:12

actually, this might have been that other problem I was having too compounding it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2023 21:12

that's what I thought, which is why it's good to re-test

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/10/2023 21:12

but moosh ran into the initial array problem.
@ Moosh do you remember the specifics?

iirc the issue was that accessing
objectA->ObjectB->Array[x]
caused issues.
I'll retry later when I've got the time, but since moosh tested it too they might have clarity

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2023 21:18

with an integer array inside 2 nested objects, I get no issue, at least
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1142543630897266819/1150540711431778325/image.png?ex=65e4e909&is=65d27409&hm=960faa7caa1e528e92efe61cccc90ff4e885afec330e7e0f61624da4edf01e8b&)
so it isn't something inherently wrong with `object->object->arr[index];` syntax

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2023 21:24

...I made it more complicated with a nested class and uhhh

...that definitely appears to be working absolutely fine and correctly

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2023 23:17

```Is it by chance in an array? Seems foo->bar->var works, but foo->bar[0]->var does not. I don't understand how Emily's class stuff works so no clue why or how hard it would be to fix. Though if you store it to a new pointer you can then use that just fine
bar b = foo->bar[0];
b->test = 7;```
this was the bug Mani and I observed

ahk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2023 00:35

fixed
missed a particular edge case related to the datatype class / datatype array stuff
needed to add an overload of a function for DataTypeArray to return the result of that same function on the element type
so that it can fetch the associated class object of the contained type's class

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/11/2023 04:52

okay, so this is solved then now, nice.
