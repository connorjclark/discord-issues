I scripted this kind of Lens behavior, for a current test quest, but I think it would be a nice engine addition, to allow to decide if constant Button Input is required to use the lens or if you want to simply activate/deactivate it by pressing the Button once.

I am also supporting this feature request. Jumping from one invisible platform to another, enemy fight in secret passages etc...

=== @ Bagu 12/13/2021 00:21

Exactly!

=== @ Bagu 12/13/2021 00:32

...esspecially when jumping on moving, invisible platforms

yeah, this should be in if for no other reason than OOT did it this way
which is the justification for why hits under the effect of nayru's love still confer knockback, for instance, even though i'm not too much of a fan of that i have to respect it

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "yeah, this should be in if fo‚Ä¶"): ....It was a toggle in OOT??

=== @ Bagu 12/16/2021 11:11

In OoT it did was handled by single pressing, yes
...not by constant input

=== @ Bagu 12/16/2021 11:15

I scripted this with a trick
...I used an identifier "lens_on" it initiates a constant input if it's = 1 (by pressing the button once), while pressing the button again sets it back to "0" (and stop constant input)

Also if Start is pressed, or the equiped item is not the lens, or link is falling, or MP is < 1 (etc) ... it's instantly set to "0"
But that's definitly not the best way to do it üôÇ üôÇ üôÇ
(it's just a "for the moment" solution, to me)
