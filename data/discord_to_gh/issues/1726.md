On the latest build of ZC for Mac (7/9/22), if I start ZQuest Launcher and change the resolution from the default 640x480 to 1600x1200 and then immediately exit, when I go back in to ZQuest Launcher the resolution will still show 1600x1200. However, if I change the resolution and actually launch ZC Player the next time I start ZQuest Launcher the resolution will have defaulted back to 640x480
