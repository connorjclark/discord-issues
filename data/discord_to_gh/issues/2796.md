This shows up when profiling classic_1st.zplay running uncapped FPS. Seems like a lot. Can we cache any part of this work?

I uhh, have no clue how best to go about caching anything here
scripts could move any subscreen element
scripts can change tiles which can change visuals of any element
scripts can change items, and the player can gain/lose items, which can change visuals
counters going up/down
the cursor moving every time it moves on the active
...but it's absolutely the passive being an issue here
Might be able to cache something for the passive more easily than the active?
not sure though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 02:51

this is ~8% now (I think the only reduction came from making dummy items not call ffscript dealloc in destructor)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 02:52

lol, nice

unpack_tile shows up a bit here, but also a lot elsewhere, so worth looking at that more. most time is spent unpacking 4bit tiles. it's really slow. should consider a LRU cache or something here (or do the math for how much space it'd be to just keep everything in memory indefinetly, once loaded keep it around)
that's 5% of the CPU time unpacking 4bit tiles
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1167919957783363604/1169832209549635694/image.png?ex=65ea7e25&is=65d80925&hm=34a3336e59fa21cbbbbcd6b02514b83a2fbed605ec6249db6de1083b652df6db&)
that's a very hot loop

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 02:56

wowee
I mean, what really is the size difference between 4b and 8b tiles?
it's just 2x right?
so...
that seems fairly small

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 02:57

solve for x üòõ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 02:57

especially given that blank tiles don't take up space
probably worth it to just store everything in the format 8bit uses then

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 02:58

oh, this function also handles rotations

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 02:58

...oh, fun

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 02:58

so that's a few more multipliers
so I'm thinking a cache is the way to go instead of preprocessing from 4bit -> 8bit format an init
then we can cache all the other formats and their transformations
just keeping like .... a couple 1000 most recently used... idk
need to figure out what numbers we are dealing with first

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 02:59

eh, I feel like changing the format is better, esp in the long run
because newly saved quests wouldn't need to do anything on init, they would just save that way

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 03:00

this function still needs to do work for 8 bit
for rotations
and even for no transformation, it still copies data and read all over memory

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 03:00

hmm, fair

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 03:02

though I mean
for no transformation could read directly from the tilebuf for 8bit, couldn't it?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 03:03

i believe so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 03:03

then instead of using the global `unpackbuf`, could have `unpack_tile` return a `const*`- which could either be to `unpackbuf` in the case of transformation, or a cache thing, or directly from the tilebuf for a non-transform 8bit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 03:03

currently it copies
yup, this interface turning into a const* is what I had in mind too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 03:04

and then if we stored the 4bit tiles in the 8bit format (which is honestly not that big a filesize/memory increase I would estimate)
then any tile with no transformation could be done directly, without any cache needed
...and, I find that tiles with transformations are far less common than tiles with.
(People often do the transformation as a separate tile in the editor, instead of using the actual rotate/flip feature)
it would mostly be the case for certain enemy animation styles
which, a cache could then help with those

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 03:05

ok, so let's convert 4b -> 8b, return a const pointer when no transformation needed, and see in profiler if cache is needed for the rest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 03:06

üëç

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 03:32

ummm don't I need a cset to go from 4b to 8b
looking at `convert_tile`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 03:35

err, you actually do for an individual draw
otherwise the 4bit tile would always draw in cs0
...but that should be something that can be added when using whatever pointer is returned by unpack_tile
or w/e

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 03:36

the drawing fns like overtile16 add the cset after unpacking

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 03:36

we wouldn't want that for the new storage method

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 03:36

but I'm getting effy colors so idk what is wrong

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 03:36

...oh, they already do

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 03:37

```c++
int j = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < NEWMAXTILES; i++)
{
    if (blank_tile_table[i])
        continue;

    tiledata& tile = newtilebuf[i];
    if (tile.format != tf4Bit || !tile.data)
        continue;

    // unpackbuf now has the tile.
    unpack_tile(newtilebuf, i, 0, true);
    // for (int32_t i = 0; i < 256; i++)
    // {
    //     unpackbuf[i] &= 15;
    // }
    tile.format = tf8Bit;
    free(tile.data);
    tile.data = (byte*)malloc(tilesize(tf8Bit));
    memcpy(tile.data, unpackbuf, tilesize(tf8Bit));
    j += 1;
}
```
i figured this would work (it doesnt)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 03:37

`convert_tile` is used for when the user, in ZQ, changes a tile from 4bit to 8bit or vice-versa
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "```c++
int j = 0;
for (int i‚Ä¶"): err, if `tile.format` is `tf8bit` then it won't work
`tile.format` still needs to be `tf4bit`
but `tilesize()` needs to return the same for 4bit/8bit
(if `tile.format == tf8bit`, it won't add a color- which is correct for actual 8bit tiles)

this being the issue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 03:43

yup, i see it now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 04:15

think i got it
for hero of dreams it was ~30k tiles to convert, so roughly an extra 3MB of memory and ~10ms processing time
good trade

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 04:27

unpack_tile went from ~9.3% to 7.5%, and I've only done the first part. will handle avoiding the needless copy in the common case next

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 05:50

and now with the don't-copy part: 0.4%
ü§Ø

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2023 05:52

woweeee

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 06:04

subscreen drawing is roughly ~5.5% CPU now.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/03/2023 06:05

a lot of it is string related

I'm gonna leave perf stuff alone for now.
