Zscript Additions.txt includes a variable `Animation` that is a member of sprite objects, including itemsprite. but i get an error for `Animation` not existing under pointer when i use `this->Animation` in a itemsprite script.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Lincolnpepper this w…"): it compiles, but it doesn't seem to work. 
```
itemsprite script Test
{
    void run()
    {
        this->Animation = false;
    }
}
```
i put this itemsprite script on a rupee and it didn't stop the rupee's animation
