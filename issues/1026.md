the quests that were using the sounds default of the previous default module have been changed with the sounds of the new module

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 12:38

Don't know if this is a bug,but deserves a mention.  Second

???????

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 19:09

Since the new module changes the default sound effects, quests that used the previous default sound effects are now using the new ones.

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 19:11

So in laments terms
Zelda 1 sounds got turned into Koten sounds

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 19:12

sfx should be stored in the quest file
this points to a serious underlying problem

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 20:15

Good thing we reported it then

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 20:15

indeed
people can sorta fix it by going back to the previous module but it's still pretty weird that the sfx aren't tied to the quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:22

The problem I see here is this may not be fully fixable, depending on the exact nature of the problem
because to fix it may *require* a quest be re-saved
unless it stores the appropriate sfx, and is just *ignoring* them for the module, which is possible; I haven't looked into it yet

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 20:24

Hey @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) , can we get together in the server's voice chat for a minute?  General1?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:25

give me a few, just got done with a super difficult run of a game that I've been doing for *hours*

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 20:25

OK

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:43

. . .
so no one is gonna like this
but it's literally not fixable
the SFX for the ones from sfx.dat are literally not being saved in the qst file
so old quests literally don't have anything in them in those slots
meaning either we need to include the copyrighted sfx in the default package *forever*
or break sfx in old quests
both of which are "unacceptable" outcomes
catch-22 situation, nothing we can do
....I can fix this for quests that are *re-saved in a new build*
but can't do anything more

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 20:46

mmm
that is pretty problematic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 20:47

gonna have to discuss with devs on course of action here
because either we break old quests
or we postpone being copyright-free until the rewrite

=== @ Guinevere 09/17/2021 20:53

i mean
i know my two-sense isn't the strongest in terms of development discussions like this
but i think it would be much less of a headache if you postpone until the rewrite, since one of the main focuses of 2.55 is backwards compatibility with all the quests that were made in the previous versions
it keeps priorities of what you want to do with both 2.55 and the rewrite intact

=== @ NightmareJames 09/17/2021 21:13

https://youtu.be/WGWweXnW__w This is the bug in action (including a custom SFX in action)

=== @ vlamart 09/17/2021 22:27

If I work on a sfx library, should I follow the "tracklisting" in the constants doc?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:28

what listing?
The `SFX_` constants?

=== @ vlamart 09/17/2021 22:29

Yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:29

probably
scripts may potentially expect them to be as-is
and most questmakers keep their sfx in the same order as default for ease of use
