Ether was playing Darkness Within and the sideview section during the first boss is broken. From what it looked like it seemed like moving left and right didn't work when jumping; maybe the code for if you're grid aligned overrode whatever code let you not be grid aligned before?

Does this need to be bisected to find the commit or do you already know the issue?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/21/2024 23:51

I do not; haven't looked at any potentialcauses yet
but yeah needs to be bisected
hopefully it was introduced after replays were a thing
and not before
well, actually I guess it doesn't matter; it's not a minor quirk but a whole thing failing, hopefully don't need a replay to test that

dmap 8 scr 36

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/22/2024 07:35

Alpha 108 broken. Can't test further than that on my mac tonight.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) I found first bad commit: https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/637081e64604489b9561ffab0798e96539f61c71

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2024 03:59

sighhh
thank you for finding this
of course it'd be fakez that breaks it...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 05:31

sure thing
good luck

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 06:52

what is fakez anyway

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2024 06:58

you know how vires "jump" into the air but you can still hit them and it's really just moving their Y axis?
fakez and fakejump is meant to replicate that for scripts
so you can have Link "jump" into the air through the Y axis without affecting his actual Y position
as opposed to "real" Z which affects collision

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 07:01

Does anything in engine set fakez directly (different from z)?
or strictly just scripts

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2024 07:08

fakefall sets fakez
and fakefall is used if the movement flag "don't use fake z" is unchecked, and the screen is overhead instead of sideview, and only if fakez is not 0

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2024 07:11

and I think there's a moveflag for using fakez instead of realz?
but the latter is only for enemies

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2024 07:13

I touched a lot of stuff related to whether link is on the ground or in the air though when adding fakez because it's like... two separate z values
and it needs to check for both of them
so it's possible I screwed something up

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 21:18

If you face up, the jump works.

If you face left or right, player does not move up. Just rolls in place.

So I set a breakpoint on Hero.y changing, faced right, and jumped. The ydiff is being set correctly (starting to move player up), but then the value changes in the same frame from this code:

https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/b9ebc75d9f656757589db00ddbfda49ae0b9cf80/src/zc/hero.cpp#L8912

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 21:21

(z and fakez are zero)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 21:22

ah, but fakefall is 0 and fall is non zero

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 21:25

the logic should be this instead `(fall == 0 || z > 0) && (fakefall == 0 || fakez > 0)`
that seems to fix.
unrelated to this i think: the hit box on these flames with the player seems kinda random

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 21:28

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "the logic should be this inst…"): @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) does this make sense to you?

Trying in CI now.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 21:31

Could you scan the above commit that introduce fakez for similar logic errors?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/24/2024 21:38

ohhh

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/24/2024 21:54

I'm not seeing any in hero
I'm surprised I missed the one I did

Minor issue, just needing a replay check. old broken code had player transition screens at this frame i believe

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 22:45

It's just one replay, and it can be nice to not bump the replay version, so I'll do this:

```cpp
bool is_broken_behavior = replay_is_active() && replay_get_meta_str("sav") == "link_to_the_zelda_2_of_3.sav";
bool fall_check = (fall == 0 || z > 0) && (fakefall == 0 || fakez > 0);
if (is_broken_behavior)
   fall_check = (fall == 0 || z > 0) || (fakefall == 0 || fakez > 0);
```
