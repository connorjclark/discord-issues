This is an idea for ways to show formerly sound-only gameplay-affecting qualities for deaf people or people who are playing without sound.

-Bombable Wall and Combo Tapping - Add a spark like in oracles when the combo being tapped is bombable? I don't have any particular desire on how the sprite is determined. It could either be per-sword, a hardcoded sprite after the sword beam explosions, a global sprite for all swords, or even just recycling the boomerang/arrow poof effect or the sword beam's explosion effect.

-Sword and Hammer Charging - This presents a few issues, because there needs to be a distinguishing between Spin Attack/Hurricane Spin and Quake Hammer/Super Quake so that the player knows whether they are at a level 1 or 2 charge. Flashing swords/hammers might be hard to define in ZQuest unless the CSets are hardcoded or we do the costly idea of adding two definable flash CSets to the swords and hammers or scrolls... and what if the user wants the 4-CSet auto-flash?

We could also use two levels of rumbling effects on Link or the sword/hammer while it's charged, similar to the Stone of Agony/Farore's Wind.

#928 would handle charging (should add the same to hammer, didn't think about that)
as for the tapping, I could add a tapping sprite to misc sprites, letting the questmaker set a sprite for it
will want to update qst.dat with a sprite filled for that, and the sword sparkle options enabled and set up, so that `File->New` has that done already
(meta) thread name was changed: 🔓Deafness Improvements
good suggestions, something to move up the list

ok so i think there should be a "normal" poke spark sprite for each sword and then a "special" poke spark sprite for when it pokes something bombable
