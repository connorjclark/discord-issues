Writing to these doesn't seem to do anything, even though Trace() confirms they are being written

This has a simple screen script that should be changing layer 1's screen every two seconds. Trace statements look correct, but the layer never updates

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2024 19:18

well, I presume the answer here is
the layer number updates
but the layer number is only used on screen load or something?

=== @ mitchfork 01/24/2024 19:27

probably
didn't test if it works with mapdata

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2024 19:27

I would expect editing it on mapdata to work
when you re-enter the screen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 20:11

These change the tmpscr's `layerscreen` and `layermap` properties, but they do not reload into the actual layer tmpscr2 temporary screens

(just rephrasing what emily said)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 20:13

so this makes ->LayerScreen[]/LayerMap[] pretty much useless
so useless perhaps we can change it without introducing a compat QR?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2024 20:15

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "so this makes ->LayerScreen[]…"): mostly useful as a read not a write

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 20:15

yeah i just meant the write

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2024 20:16

the problem is, do you want to have it reload the screen on change? as then it'd often reload twice, once when you change map then again for screen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 20:20

good point, we could introduce a new SetScreenLayer(lyr, map, screen)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 20:21

It would need to also apply whatever secrets/states have been applied to that individual mapscr (unless we just recall loadscr...)
@ mitchfork how are you planning on using this? To change just a single layer, or like everything? Do you expect the player/enemies/everything else to remain on the screen?

=== @ mitchfork 01/24/2024 20:34

Just to change the layer
Enemies, player, FFCs unaffected
I would say just visual but would want solidity and combos to update on layers 1/2 of course
If it forces the screen to be reloaded that's basically useless imo
(and already probably possible by setting this through mapdata and pitwarping to the same screen)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 20:37

(replying to @ mitchfork "If it forces the screen to be…"): agreed
We just need to be sure to apply things like perm secrets when reloading a specific layer.
which is usually only done in loadscr.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2024 20:38

yeah, this'd need a version of loadscr that does just one layer

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 20:38

I nearly have just that in z3 branch...sigh

=== @ mitchfork 01/24/2024 20:39

I think this should be noted as read-only for Screen also

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 20:41

do we just call hidden_entrance?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2024 20:42

. . . would need to only apply to the layer being loaded

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 20:43

but wouldnt loadscr have already handled those, so it's fine to check everything again? only if `if(game->maps[(currmap*MAPSCRSNORMAL)+scr]&mSECRET)` ofc

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2024 20:44

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "but wouldnt loadscr have alre…"): its possible for secrets to trigger *multiple times* causing multiple different effects
so, if you run it again on the already-run layers, it could have a wrong effect

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 20:44

got it
looking closer at hidden_entrance its nbd to just copy some of that code for this new command
