A multiplier of the player's base walk speed. Should probably be stored as a numerator/denominator

Might be neat as well to add an itemclass that allows you to change the speed multiplier while it's equipped. That would go well with the planned "active" passive items a la rings.

per-shield done

so um does it only apply while you have the shield up
