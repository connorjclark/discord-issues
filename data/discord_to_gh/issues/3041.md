guessing `decorations` isn't cleared on screen transition?
not sure if it's safe to just clear that or not, compat-wise

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 02:55

when was "general tab sprites" added?
(is that what you'd call it?)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2024 02:56

uhh, within the last couple months?
IIRC?
nevermind
time flies doesn't it
7 months

Honestly if this is the first time we've heard about it, it seems to me that no one has used it until now.
So I vote no compat.
I can see some possible use for a sprite not despawning, but it wouldn't be common.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 03:01

so since it seems really unexpected for it to remain, I'd think if anyone was using it they would have reported it by now. so no compat rule should not break anyone

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2024 03:04

yeah, sounds sane
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "not sure if it's safe to just‚Ä¶"): but that's not what I meant by this
unsure if that would affect anything *unrelated* that uses the same `sprite_list`, like water ripples/grass tufts

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 03:05

ah, I see

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 03:06

just push the obvious fix to a branch and lets see if replays fail?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 03:08

when does screen scroll even clear these sprite lists?
I see walkup,down,other places doing it
but not how scrolling screens would

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2024 03:14

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "when does screen scroll even‚Ä¶"): ALLOFF

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 03:14

ah that lovely function

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2024 03:19

`void ALLOFF(bool messagesToo = true, bool decorationsToo = true, bool force = false);`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2024 03:22

start of scrollscr does `ALLOFF(false, false);`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2024 04:01

i marked the decorations of the old screen and delete them on the first frame after a screen scroll.

lots of gfx changes since then the clk resets for the decoration that replaces them, where before it would animate smoothly across screens

I see `comboSprite::animate(int32_t)` is like all the others in that it dies after some time... why do we want to delete them manually?

because they no longer line up with the combo they were supposed to sit on, after a scroll

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2024 07:29

is it just that these combo animations may be much longer than these short existing decoration sprites, so its more noticeable when they stick around till they finish?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2024 07:38

jenny - could you describe your encounter with this bug? does the animation _never_ go away (that's not something I've been able to reproduce), or does it stick around longer than you thought it should but eventually goes away?
