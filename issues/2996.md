Changers should be excluded from trigger groups... and in trying to apply that fix, you may recall severe breakage of main a bit ago. I am fucking baffled as to what's wrong here.
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) likely gonna need some help from you on this one as I have no idea why it's breaking
ASAN gives:

. . . .which is *completely unrelated to the stuff I changed*?
. . . oh. Oh, I see what caused that though, that's a separate issue.
I had 0 save files, but used the `Replay` menu to play back a replay- on trying to exit the replay, there *are no saves to read from*, as saves were empty...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 18:12

aha
when launching a replay it selects save 0
even if save 0 does not exist

...gonna just convert this report to being for this
(meta) thread name was changed: Replay memory issues
not sure how best to fix it
This seems to work

but unsure if that's proper, or if it should be avoiding the `saves_select(0)` in the first place, or what

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/19/2024 18:36

Doesn't replaying set save 0 to a fake save?
Maybe that's just test mode

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 18:37

doesn't appear to
test mode I would assume does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 18:44

gonna make another thread for the actual issue that lead me to find this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/19/2024 18:49

oh,I tried loading a playground test file once and it crashed around here once it ended
unsure if I can reproduce

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 18:52

ASAN reproduced it every time
at least
and that fix did fix it
just not sure if there's a *more right* way to fix it
(i.e. I added a sanity check, rather than fixing the source of the problem)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/19/2024 19:55

the saves are cleared here when loading a replay https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/c81d068a69b93be8aca671071f8629530afb3e56/src/zc/zelda.cpp#L4948-L4950

then the block starting at L4968 makes the first save slot

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/19/2024 19:57

Can you give a stack trace? How to repro? Is this a specific branch (or one of the commits I reverted, which one)? Don't know where to start.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 20:09

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Can you give a stack trace? H…"): Repro:
- `main`, ASAN (not my fork, actual main, unrelated to my other issues)
- run zplayer, `Replay->Load Replay (assert)`, `playground_lifting.zplay`
- errors on end of replay

thank ya
here's the fix

at the end of the game loop, there's a bit of code that runs to clean up after a replay
