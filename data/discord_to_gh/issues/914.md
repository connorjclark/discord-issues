This GUI edit will allow Decimal/Hex/Binary entry, as well as `long` versions of each of these for 32-bit spaces.

32-bit spaces still WIP, unsigned 8-bit and signed 16-bit are done

neat
that's convenient for using attributes for flagging

Woo!
Big Success!
(After the `.` is always base-10, because, 10000 isn't a power of 16)
(and, uh, just general... bleh reasons)
(but, hex for the integer portion works!)
(....now just to add long variants that don't have a decimal portion, which IN THEORY should be far easier.)

aye, was far easier

....binary would require making the textfields larger more than likely, which I really don't want to do now
so I'll relegate adding a binary option for a future build; gonna call this good for this alpha.
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) just waiting on your sideview swimming for the alpha, then

err, well, I need to add this to InitD in a bunch of places, I guess
but the procs are done which is the hard part by far
