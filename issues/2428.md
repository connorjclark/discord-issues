zelda.cpp line 5362; built from latest commits (so not in the latest nightly). This section attempts to fake a blank save for test mode to work, but it's not actually clearing it. This results in the quest file being unable to be opened in test mode due to the title header not being blank; changing it from saves[0].Clear() to saves[0] = new gamedata; allows me to open the quest, but all my counters are maxed and draining and scripts are broken. This issue appears to be test-mode specific, as the quest loads fine when loading from a new save.

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) I'm assuming this is related to your change to make gamedata use default constructors given the commit history

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 17:13

Ok I'll look

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 17:18

If you want to do a nightly right now, feel free to revert that commit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 17:19

Can you tell what in the old Clear method wasn't actually being cleared to the defaults?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/08/2023 17:30

It's hard to tell cause so many things were breaking, but ```std::fill(_maxcounter, _maxcounter+32, 0);
    std::fill(_counter, _counter+32, 0);
    std::fill(_dcounter, _dcounter+32, 0);
    std::fill(version, version+17, 0);
    std::fill(title, title+65, 0);``` These for sure were broken

https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/1fb9b4f31d7a6365eb9e82274bd7cb2fdbd2f40b#diff-d4358d2c742279f53808c987c8ed587c48ca84d780edaf468e9c97315cfa981aR38 This line should be setting everything to defaults.
Was the Clear function here doing something that isn't "set back to defaults"?
Or does that line have no effect for you? in a debugger, is gamedata_default all defaults (it should be) ?
By defaults, I refer to what the values are as defined in the header. Either 0 implicitly or what it is defined to be (like  `forced_awpn = -1`  and friends)

I can't find any issue when doing test mode on my mac, I'll try on windows in a bit. For now I'll revert this and push a nightly!

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) was  the problem with any quest or just a specifc one?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 18:55

TIL these are not the same

ooof

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 18:57

You were in release mode yea?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/08/2023 18:57

debug mode

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 18:57

ah, maybe it just worked in release mode by chance...
since the tests passed and all
weird
(in debug mode, uninitalized memory is given known nonzero values to catch bugs like this. In release mode it is often just zero by chance)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/08/2023 18:59

that would explain it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 19:07

Can you try out the latest commit I just pushed? Should be all good now.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/08/2023 19:07

will try

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/08/2023 19:20

Seems to be fixed?
