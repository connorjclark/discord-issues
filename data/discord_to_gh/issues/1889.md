Old Report: #1881 
Apparently in adding combo pool shit I fucked up favorite combos quite badly.... will need to check the exact old code from BEFORE the FIRST combo pool commit, and restore whatever parts of it are broken.

@ Tabletpillow @ SkyLizardGirl should be fixed for next build

Oh ok ty.*

I tested the latest nightly today and it seems like the favorite combos page still isn't fixed.

look at the date on the latest nightly
and the date that I said `fixed for next build`
and note that the nightly is older than that fix
