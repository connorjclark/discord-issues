This is the whole window. The bottom and right sides are getting cut off
I launched ZC via the test menu; this is with a newly compiledZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2022 12:03

....bug confirmed on my end, WHAT THE FUCK
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) any idea what the hell happened here?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/05/2022 15:17

Nope. Try a bisect?

=== @ NightmareJames 10/06/2022 01:27

Confirmed

I bisected this to fb95ba0
`Add 'Insert SCC' dialog`

can you explain the changes made to widget.cpp here? https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/fb95ba0a2c3be0e7604aa010d7cf1e944d64725f#diff-2217bc688ba2ad509c0a22491e39e92f9a39b20182bc0f5a37131caf3025c9c6R182

aw fuck
that WAS fixing a bug
I can't recall offhand what it was though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 09:54

...oh no I do recall
bleh I see
I *half* fixed the bug
and caused this shit
Those changes need to apply to everything that is *NOT* a Top-Level Widget
which should fix this?
It applying to the top-level widget of `Window` is causing this bug
but, it NOT applying to normal things was causing some things to be entirely off-centered in cases where they tried to be larger than their `maxwidth`/`maxheight` but were constrained
the insert SCC dialog showcased this error, as actually the first place in any dialog that had this issue, thus why that's when it got fixed
just woke up, gonna heat up some leftover pizza, and then I'll fix this up quick. Shouldn't be THAT bad.
