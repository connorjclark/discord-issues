Reported by Haylee elsewhere. Here it is breaking in the Classic set

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
also wait
the colour is off too

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 17:58

I don't think?
BS patra has always been blue in Classic
unless you mean the palette overall in which case I think Emily might've tweaked some colors?
nope, those aren't using the darker shades. IDK what it is

=== @ vlamart 06/05/2023 18:00

I know exactly what this is I think because I had similar issues with all big enemies when I was working with cambria

=== @ P-Tux7 06/05/2023 18:00

nah it uses the dodongo cset, at least by default in 1.92/2.10
hmm wait it might be a quest rule

=== @ P-Tux7 06/05/2023 18:01

try checking this and see if it works

=== @ vlamart 06/05/2023 18:02

Most bosses have wonky/wrong math when trying to jump Y tiles

=== @ P-Tux7 06/05/2023 18:02

yeah it seems as though this fix for normal 2x2 enemies broke the bosses

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 18:03

that'd be @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @ P-Tux7 06/05/2023 18:03

the bosses probably read as 1x1 and the math tries to account for 1x1 instead of 2x2 or whatever
already pinged her lol

=== @ vlamart 06/05/2023 18:03

I had to use a script to correct a 2x3 Aquamentus

=== @ P-Tux7 06/05/2023 18:03

oh those
i think the only enemies to really have size change support are walking/flying and a few others
wizzrobes, zoras, leevers, and other simple ones such as peahat, ghini, and ganon?

=== @ vlamart 06/05/2023 18:04

And noticed it pretty much happens to _anything_ bigger than 2 though (especially if the enemy is default already 2x2)

=== @ P-Tux7 06/05/2023 18:04

though i suppose the fact that someone is using a 2x3 aquamentus might be ample cause to bug deedee about it then
wait even 3x3 walking enemies?
i wish you'd reported this

=== @ vlamart 06/05/2023 18:05

I had a long time ago and never remembered to bump it

=== @ vlamart 06/05/2023 18:08

Should I re-report it or was that ping good enough?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 18:08

if you could link to that report here that would be good

=== @ P-Tux7 06/05/2023 18:08

bump it so that the issue can be resolved separately and marked complete
because if this one gets marked complete, your other one won't be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 18:09

don't bother making a new one, just link the old one here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/11/2023 09:27

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) do you have time to look at this?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2023 09:32

could try; have a few things over the next few days

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2023 18:34

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2023 18:35

right, need to stop procrastinating

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2023 21:11

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) could you (or someone else) provide some guidance on where to look/get started debugging this issue?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 02:35

okay so it's tied to the Hardcoded BS Patra rule

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 02:37

the broken big enemy rule seems to be unrelated
the main thing the hardcoded bs patra rule does is, if off, it uses the same code for both patras and bs patras but with some modifiers

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 02:40

oh god this patra code is a mess
why did I do it like this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 02:42

main patra enemy sets default size and etc if dmisc10 (aka the switch for big patras) is on; regular patra's drawing code runs enemy::draw, while bspatras do manual tile-setting stuff
did I even account for that?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 02:48

hold on, might've figured it out

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 02:52

okay yeah it was dumb
classic.qst had the wrong animation style set for bs patras
it wasn't set to any of the big animation styles; it should be set to 4 frame 8 dir Big + tracking

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 02:54

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) how do you update the default quest again?
Sorry for taking so long to look into this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 03:00

`modules/classic/default.qst`
iirc

=== @ P-Tux7 12/05/2023 03:03

will that fix it in imported quests from 2.50 and below

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 03:05

no
because it's an error in the quests themselves

=== @ P-Tux7 12/05/2023 03:09

sorry to be a know it all but, aren't all 2.10 and below quests assigned each enemy default animation styles since those versions had no animation style dialog?
so, when loading it in 2.55, we can set it to whatever we want in zquest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 03:11

ah, yeah, so we'd want to fix that for old quests
(you said 2.50 and below, I see `2.50` and go `enemy editor`)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 03:14

the problem is older versions used "big enemy" for patra iirc

=== @ P-Tux7 12/05/2023 03:15

yeah i was gonna say
we need code to force the 2.50 patras that animate right in 2.50 to animate right in 2.55

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 03:15

do they not animate right in 2.50 if you load it?
it's a compat QR that you have to toggle to make them use the new code, which in turn makes them obey animation style

=== @ P-Tux7 12/05/2023 03:16

i thought that was haylee's issue, opening a 2.50 tileset in 2.55, and the BS Patra isn't set to the proper style?
OHH

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 03:17

so what likely happened is they toggled bugfixes but said bugfixes didn't set bs patras to use the correct animation style

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 03:18

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) what is defdata.cpp?
noticing that bs patras are set to use a4FRM8EYE there for their newer animation

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 03:20

would changing that to a4FRM8EYEB (the big version) do anything?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 03:21

ah, seems like it would mostly affect older quests

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 03:23

I don't see any reason why changing it would harm anything given bs patras in older quest only use enemy::draw if old enemy animation is on; they have their own hardcoded drawing otherwise unless the hardcoded patra qr is off
assuming that's all that needs to be done to fix it for old quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 03:34

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) what is…"): not a single clue never touched it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 04:53

commit the fix so hopefully pre-enemy-editor quests and new quests will use the right animation style
debating whether or not to have qst loading code change the animation style for big patras being ported forward

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 16:24

will be a bit before I push though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/07/2023 10:55

pushed, should be fixed for pre enemy editor stuff and the new default
