Is it possible to have these settings have a button *apply these specific settings to all strings*? I feel like margins would be a consistent setting for most strings. It's different from paste styles since pasting styles would also apply to things like test position and portraits as well, which is something I don't want to have the same to all strings.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:07

err, well
margins are part of the string's style
so
same as the x/y/width/height are

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:09

I wonder how internal string data are handled. Is it possible for a non-dev to access it? Like open it up on notepad or something?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:09

...?
If you want to look at the code, you can check the github
it's open source
but, uh
it's handled as binary data, same as everything else
so, all the numbers you enter? It's just... writing those numbers to a file, one after the other, with nothing inbetween
in a specific order

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:11

I see, so it's in my quest file right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:11

aye
that's all the quest file really is
a bunch of numbers
written into a file
in a very specific order
though, it goes through some compression stuff as well
(You can save as an unencoded quest, though, which doesn't have that then?)
but, uh
if you're thinking of trying to mess with that data directly
.....well, good luck!

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:15

...Yeah, I think I have already given up on that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:16

.....perhaps an `Advanced Paste`, similar to combos, would be doable?
Definitely not a high priority though, especially not with multiple open bug reports that are *crashes*
so it'd be a bit

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:20

Yeah this is a heavy string quest problem in which I would not rather individually edit all 4000+ strings I have.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:21

in the meantime, that compat rule gives you the old behavior

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:21

I actually had that checked. But it doesn't seem to change anything.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:22

....if that's checked, margins don't do anything at all
so
with that on, it works just like it used to
which is to say, it once again allows strings to overflow outside of the textbox
....which generally looks bad/glitchy, thus why margins were added

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:23

Yeah I can see that:

Although I believe old string margins from the previous build didn't have this issue in my quest specifically.
Since maybe the margins for the old quests were different.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:24

String margins have not been changed in probably at least 2 years
Do note that if you click OK for the popup of `New Bugfixes Found`, that will uncheck the old string margins rule
because... that is a bugfix

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:35

Well I have that checked and I know my strings never went out of the box until this build.

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:51

I think I figured out the issue here.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:52

what?

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:52

I should've had this checked as well.

But this happens when that is checked.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:52

err, for the record
all that does

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:52

This is from a new quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:52

is add 16 to the width and height of the frame
so, uh
that's literally just making the box bigger for you
Did you manually uncheck that checkbox, or did you use the `New Bugfixes Found` popup (for your quest)

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:54

I manually did it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:54

Ahk, that'd be your issue
so, what you want to do
is check that checkbox

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1021180465127891047/1021192560535932938/unknown.png?ex=65e4ffaf&is=65d28aaf&hm=b855d7b325cad9a9f24cddd322239133112a28ee8a141c402f4d737fd038df85&)
and then activate the `Old Strings Fix`
which will UNCHECK the checkbox.... and automatically add 16 to the width and height of every single string
(Using the `New Bugfixes Found` popup likewise handles this properly)

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 22:56

Oh okay, let me try that out.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:56

Because, here's the thing
In 2.50.2
If you set a string's `Height` to say, `32`
...you would notice that is is `48 pixels tall`
which is completely counterintuitive
Now, with that rule off, a `Height` of `32` means `32 pixels tall`, period
and, that's simple enough a change that it can be automatically processed by the bugfixing tools

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 23:04

Oh wait, I think I was wrong on the text size. That seem to not be the problem. I think it's just the margins for me. The way I can fix it is to individually set the right margin to be 8 instead of 0.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:07

Old quests had no margins whatsoever
pretty sure
...or, well, hmm, not true
they had no bottom margin

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1021180465127891047/1021196070493106176/unknown.png?ex=65e502f4&is=65d28df4&hm=4f7181ec3c9a1f3b87724e54dd3b23f22f779bb671b6f11f17d765d601bc7201&)
but those are the default margin settings
which should be as identical to how it worked previously as possible
The `Old String Margins` QR makes it *LITERALLY* identical to how it was before
so with that checked, margins should not be the issue

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 23:12

This is weird for me. But I will try to specifically show my problem in a few mins.

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 23:19

Oh wait, I think I did figure out the real problem. I *did* use the fix text box option. And since you said it added to the height and width of the text box, that why my textboxes suddenly became big. Which is a problem since I want to undo that increase.

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 23:21

Can you add an option to undo that addition?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:34

err, what??
It adds 16 to the width and height.... but... having the `Old Frame Size` rule unchecked means it's 16 LOWER width and height
so, it cancels out to a net 0 change
unless you're wanting your textboxes to be 16 pixels smaller than they were ORIGINALLY, but that would seem like not what you'd want

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 23:38

Hm, I'm not sure then, the fix for my specific problem would a feature request allowing us to set the width and height for all strings.
Since the bug fix had that ability the value of the width and height, I think it would be possible right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:45

An advanced paste option should work
again, very low priority right now
I recommend looking at an older copy of your quest though, because this sounds really odd
with the margin QR on, it should be IDENTICAL to 2.50.2

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 23:47

Yeah I did, the width and height were different values it's not a margin error. I probably did something that the popup added 16 to the width and height to all my textboxes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:47

uhg
again
that does not matter
in 2.50.2
32 height
was 48 pixels tall
with the frame qr off
32 height is 32 pixels tall
so what it would have done
is change 32 to 48
so that it is *still exactly 48 pixels tall*
so, no, the width and height would *NOT BE DIFFERENT*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:49

If you want to file a bug report with evidence showing what broke, please do
but I have tested this multiple times and had not a single issue in any quest
and this has not been changed in.....

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 23:50

Okay, I'll look through the problem.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:50

9th march 2020
was the last time margins were modified
almost *3* years ago

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:37

(meta) thread name was changed: String Editor 'Advanced Paste'
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ".....perhaps an `Advanced Pas…"): ^
(just bumping so that the bottom of the thread has the actual info for the feature request)
