Supposedly you have to press one Shift, one Control, and the cheat hotkey at the same time to cheat. However, both me and another user have found that we have to press both Shifts and both Controls and the cheat hotkey at the same time. I didn't report it before because I thought it was a quirk with my keyboard (it's a laptop) but now I can see it's more wide-ranging.

who the fuck edited this last
there's a blatantly obvious typo
easy as hell fix
one `&&` becomes a `||`

should be fixed
@ P-Tux7
also, it was only both shifts, not both controls
which is why I didn't notice it
as I have mine set to only use ctrl, not shift
as lshift is my start button

this sounds rather harsh and for what it's worth wouldn't make me want to get out of my zc coding slump if i was deedee
maybe she was tired after all that work or was distracted by offline stuff
and for this bug especially it's barely an issue

thank you for pointing that out
stoned me is not very articulate

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) get you…"): Look, it was complex code ok
