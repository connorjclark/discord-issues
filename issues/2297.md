As discussed in voip yesterday, this would be a sprite layer which follows the player's sprite layer. This is the next best thing to drawing to the sprite layers, which are a huge pain.
Posting it here mostly for Emily to remember

That is definitely drawing above Link but below Layer 3

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 16:45

```cpp
#include "std.zh"

global script Active
{
    void run()
    {
        while(true)
        {
            Screen->DrawTile(SPLAYER_PLAYER_DRAW, Hero->X-8,
                Hero->Y-8, 520, 2, 2, 0);
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```

ALSO, this feature comes with an optimization as well.
Script drawing commands, when added, now mark the layer they are for as 'dirty'. Layers not marked dirty skip the process of *looping through every single drawing command*.

In other words, layers that have 0 script draws to them, don't waste time looping through every script draw. This is important with adding more layers to preserve performance.
`SPLAYER_PLAYER_DRAW`, for the record, is `layer -200000`.
Plenty of room for more special layers to be added

=== @ Russ 05/01/2023 17:03

Thank freaking goodness, bout time we got something like this

=== @ mitchfork 05/01/2023 17:03

Would this be a good place to request more special layers?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:07

(replying to @ mitchfork "Would this be a good place to…"): sure

=== @ mitchfork 05/01/2023 17:11

•lweapon
•eweapon
•npc
Would be super helpful. I suppose item sprite would also make sense but I don't have a specific use for that one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:11

So, notably, those don't just work as single layers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:13

Draw order:
-EWeapons that have `Behind = true`
-LWeapons that have `Behind = true`
-Enemies
-Chain links of the hookshot
-EWeapons that have `Behind = false`
-LWeapons that have `Behind = false`
-Items
....apparently that's every other frame, unless `qr_NOFLICKER` is on
if `qr_NOFLICKER` is off, then every other frame is ordered SLIGHTLY differently.

=== @ mitchfork 05/01/2023 17:14

Ahhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:14

But, regardless, the point being that eweapons and lweapons would each need to be 2 layers, due to the `Behind` value

=== @ mitchfork 05/01/2023 17:17

Would be nice to have both, yeah. I am picturing like, sword wielding enemies where the sword has to flip between in front/behind depending on facing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:17

Oh, also fun

=== @ mitchfork 05/01/2023 17:17

I did this jankily with the current engine capabilities but

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:17

After all that, it draws any enemy that has *grabbed link* (wallmaster/likelike), and then any enemy that is sufficiently in the air
which is defined as 'above Link's Z'

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:22

Also, important thing to note
Some of these special layers... may draw more than once per frame.
because, FUN WEIRD TIMING SHIT!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:43

```cpp
    SPLAYER_EWEAP_BEHIND_DRAW, //Eweapons with 'Behind = true'
    SPLAYER_EWEAP_FRONT_DRAW, //Eweapons with 'Behind = false'
    SPLAYER_LWEAP_BEHIND_DRAW, //Lweapons with 'Behind = true'
    SPLAYER_LWEAP_FRONT_DRAW, //Lweapons with 'Behind = false'
    SPLAYER_LWEAP_ABOVE_DRAW, //Lweapons with (Z+FakeZ) > Init Data 'Jump Layer Height', IF the player is also above this height.
    SPLAYER_CHAINLINK_DRAW, //Hookshot chain links
    SPLAYER_NPC_DRAW, //Enemies
    SPLAYER_NPC_ABOVEPLAYER_DRAW, //Enemies 'grabbing' the player, or with a higher Z than the player
    SPLAYER_NPC_AIRBORNE_DRAW, //Flying enemies, or enemies in the Z axis (amount required QR dependant)
    SPLAYER_ITEMSPRITE_DRAW, //Itemsprites
    SPLAYER_FAIRYITEM_DRAW, //Moving fairies
    SPLAYER_PUSHBLOCK, //Pushable Blocks
    SPLAYER_MOVINGBLOCK, //Moving Pushable Blocks
    SPLAYER_OVERHEAD_CMB, //Overhead combos
    SPLAYER_OVERHEAD_FFC, //Overhead ffcs
    SPLAYER_DARKROOM_UNDER, //Under dark room darkness
    SPLAYER_DARKROOM_OVER, //Over dark room darkness```
How do these sound?
@ mitchfork
and should probably @ Moosh @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) too, take a look at this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 17:58

holy shit
thank you Emily

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:59

This was... really easy.
Surprisingly easy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 18:00

see here I was thinking it'd need to refactor the drawing code into being a single giant array with gaps in between each section of drawing and then skipping to the next "milestone" of the array whenever it hits a blank drawing code

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 18:00

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "see here I was thinking it'd…"): I mean, it is a single giant array
it just is not sorted
by layer

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 18:00

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 18:01

it loops through it, checking `if(this code's layer == current draw layer)`
....so, really, all I did is add a `do_primitives` check for layer `-200000`.
and that check is with the player's draw timing
(`SPLAYER_PLAYER_DRAW = -200000`, of course using constants)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 18:01

I mean changing every single draw in the engine to be a part of the array and sorting it prematurely by just giving a bunch of empty space and assigning things to those empty space as they're drawn

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 18:02

yeah, that sounds horrible
I would far sooner make it a map of layers to vectors of draws

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 18:02

or that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 18:02

(so, each layer has a vector of draw commands, if that layer exists- layers that have no draws don't exist)
that's the clean way, though is a total rewrite of how script draws work
...I didn't do that, at least yet
I *DID* do the nice clean optimization though
It stores an `std::set<int>`
every time draw commands are cleared it clears the set
every time a drawing command is added, it adds its' layer to the set
thus, the set contains all layer IDs that *have at least 1 draw*
allowing layers with 0 script draws to be skipped entirely, *before doing a gigantic loop through every script drawing command in existence*.
So, if you use a bunch of these special layers, it might still slow down- the map of vectors method is the way to optimize further to handle that
but the optimization I did at least means the new layers won't affect anything unless you use them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 18:23

Ahk, pushed. Gonna post a nightly today, not sure if immediately or not (gonna look through the todo list first for anything else that looks doable).
That nightly will contain in std_constants:```cpp
//Special hardcoded draw layers
//Note: These may draw multiple times, or no times at all, during a frame.
//      Timing may vary from frame to frame, and based on QRs or other settings.
enum
{
    SPLAYER_PLAYER_DRAW = -200000,  //The player, when this occurs changes based on various conditions.
    SPLAYER_EWEAP_BEHIND_DRAW, //Eweapons with 'Behind = true'
    SPLAYER_EWEAP_FRONT_DRAW, //Eweapons with 'Behind = false'
    SPLAYER_LWEAP_BEHIND_DRAW, //Lweapons with 'Behind = true'
    SPLAYER_LWEAP_FRONT_DRAW, //Lweapons with 'Behind = false'
    SPLAYER_LWEAP_ABOVE_DRAW, //Lweapons with (Z+FakeZ) > Init Data 'Jump Layer Height', IF the player is also above this height.
    SPLAYER_CHAINLINK_DRAW, //Hookshot chain links. This may draw multiple times per frame.
    SPLAYER_NPC_DRAW, //Enemies
    SPLAYER_NPC_ABOVEPLAYER_DRAW, //Enemies 'grabbing' the player, or with a higher Z than the player
    SPLAYER_NPC_AIRBORNE_DRAW, //Flying enemies, or enemies in the Z axis (amount required QR dependant)
    SPLAYER_ITEMSPRITE_DRAW, //Itemsprites
    SPLAYER_FAIRYITEM_DRAW, //Moving fairies
    SPLAYER_PUSHBLOCK, //Pushable Blocks
    SPLAYER_MOVINGBLOCK, //Moving Pushable Blocks
    SPLAYER_OVERHEAD_CMB, //Overhead combos
    SPLAYER_OVERHEAD_FFC, //Overhead ffcs
    SPLAYER_DARKROOM_UNDER, //Under dark room darkness
    SPLAYER_DARKROOM_OVER //Over dark room darkness
};```
I could use some testing of these, for sure, to make sure they all work. I tested the `SPLAYER_PLAYER_DRAW` myself, but tested none of the others

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 18:26

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) if I send you a quest file, could you figure out a bug for me?
Still don't have my dev kit set up
It's a minor drawing bug that I think is remnants of Zoria code that I thought I patched but seems to still exist

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 18:27

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) if I se…"): not the channel for this, but yes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 21:37

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) would it be possible to have both a layer for guaranteed negative draws (drawn below layer 0 even if negative layers aren't checked) and a layer for layers 2 and 3 that ignores if the negative layers are checked?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 21:38

well, it would not mesh with the actual layer 2 and 3 draws regardless of flag
i.e. all `Layer 2 never negative` draws would be above all `Layer 2` draws, even on non-layer2bg screens

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 21:39

I think that's fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 21:39

...I'm out of energy at the moment

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 21:39

that's also fine

=== @ mitchfork 05/01/2023 21:40

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Ahk, pushed. Gonna post a nig…"): this looks great

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 21:41

but they would be useful to have cause currently there's no way to draw negative without it checked, and currently you have to do some dumb shit to swap which layer is being drawn if negative layers are checked
and it'd just be more convenient to not have to account for that

=== @ mitchfork 05/01/2023 21:41

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "but they would be useful to h…"): i.e. 
```int highestBGLayer() {
    if (ScreenFlag(SF_VIEW,SFV_LAYER2BG)) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 2;
}```
(this doesn't check the DMap flag because I never use it)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 21:42

yeah
it's just annoying

=== @ mitchfork 05/01/2023 21:42

yeah

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2023 21:42

not being able to draw negative is the bigger problem I think
but since special layers are being added, I'm throwing it on the nice to have list

=== @ mitchfork 05/01/2023 21:42

agreed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 21:44

(replying to @ mitchfork "i.e. 
```int highestBGLayer()…"): ```cpp
int highestBGLayer()
{
    return IsBackgroundLayer(2) ? 1 : 2;
}```

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/02/2023 01:58

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) IsBackgroundLayer is backwards
it returns true when it should be false and vice versa
er, wrong channel

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2023 02:47

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) IsBackg…"): fixed
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ Orithan 05/30/2023 14:15

Tested the player's draw layer stuff, is all good
