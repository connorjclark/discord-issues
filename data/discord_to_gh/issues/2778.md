Recently I've been trying out ZC on my MacBook, and I've found that using control+click (such as for selecting flags for secret combos or filling out part of a screen with a combo) doesn't work (results in a simple click).  My guess is this has to do with Mac's use of control+click for right clicking but I'm not 100% sure.  I'm using Alpha 119.  The issue doesn't seem to be present on the web browser though from quick testing.

The code attempts to map this to CMD instead of CTRL but that seems broken.

Ah, it's a typo. the floodfill didn't account for this where other places do correctly swap CTRL for CMD on mac.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/22/2023 20:24

Well that's true, but also none of the others work. Looks like CMD is not registered at all.

I am able to use control with other keys (as long as it doesn't interfere with a shortcut used by Mac OS like accessing mission control), not sure if those are related to CMD though

Fixed the bug here w/ allegro-legacy, and made all usages of CTRL in our code use CTRL and CMD, depending on the platform.
