ZC version: 2.55 Alpha 97 hotfix.

The Lens of Truth does not appear to be operating with the ``Timer`` variable correctly. If ``Timer`` is set to above zero, the game does not drain resources most of the time you activate it.
If you do use it and it does cost, it runs the cost as intended.

Which quest you testing it on @ Orithan ?

=== @ Orithan 10/01/2021 11:31

My own quest.
Are there quest rules or something of the sort tied to it.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/01/2021 11:47

Can you post the quest (and any applicable saves/cheat codes)?  It helps the devs immensely

=== @ NightmareJames 10/01/2021 11:48

I'm not sure if it's publically released or you're working on a new version

=== @ Orithan 10/01/2021 15:46

Its not publicly released yet.

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/01/2021 18:16

I can confirm a similair phenomenon exist. As an experiement I tried changing the Cane of Bryna's timer value to 30 while leaving the cost at one.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/01/2021 18:16

I'll try it in Demo ZX later tonight

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/01/2021 18:17

aye

=== @ NightmareJames 10/02/2021 09:47

Might be a little longer, installing the enemy placement flags into ZX.  Give me a day or two.  Things going crazy

=== @ NightmareJames 10/04/2021 18:54

Sorry about not getting to this quickly:  Work's been rough, and I've been not feeling all too well.  I'm through Level 1 of ZX, hopefully will be in THAT area soon where you obtain the Lens

=== @ NightmareJames 10/05/2021 06:10

@ FireSeraphim I need to know the parameters of what to test.  I got the Lens out in a reasonable testing situation

These were my exact settings, I haven't changed anything else beyond this tab

=== @ NightmareJames 10/05/2021 23:44

Is this supposed to be in frames or seconds?
(so I know what I'm testing)
Demo ZX's is set at zero

=== @ NightmareJames 10/05/2021 23:58

@ FireSeraphim

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/05/2021 23:59

What do you mean by frames?
These are the only settings I changed, nothing more. nothing less.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/06/2021 00:05

Is the 30 measured in frames or seconds?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 00:15

frames

=== @ NightmareJames 10/06/2021 01:53

OK

=== @ NightmareJames 10/06/2021 05:50

Anything above a value of "7" (or binary 0111) is busted.  Does this mean anythng to you @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 15:00

```cpp
if ( frame % itemsbuf[itemid].magiccosttimer == 0 ) game->change_counter(-(itemsbuf[itemid].magic), itemsbuf[itemid].cost_counter);```
`frame` appears to be an `int`, so has a range FAR larger than 7......
....also it's a global variable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 15:02

so, very odd

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 10:21

Fixed.
