The player and launcher appear to be unaffected.

Resizing ZQ seems to consistently crash for me, see the attached video.

Tested on: nightly-2023-11-08
Apple M1 - MacOS Ventura 13.2.1

let me know if there's a good way for me to collect more crash info

Does adding this to `allegro5.cfg` prevent the crash?

```
[osx]

allow_live_resize = false
```

I'll check it right now

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/11/2023 12:58

funnily enough for me it only happens when I resize the ZC Editor, not the Player (nor the Launcher, but that didn't happen for Colin either)
If I add that allow_live_resize snippet, resizing doesn't work in the Editor, Player or Launcher and it just freezes the application

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/11/2023 13:01

I'd record it, but OBS isn't responding and I'm in a hurry!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/11/2023 19:10

yup, I see that too. I fixed for next release.
Don't have my M1 so can't test the larger issue.

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/11/2023 22:40

I can test it if I dont forget

=== @ colin 11/12/2023 15:29

added the config and gave it a shot, the resize is prevented but now I'm getting an infinity spinner and the app has frozen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/12/2023 15:36

That was addressed, seems you may not be on latest build

=== @ colin 11/12/2023 15:36

gotcha

=== @ colin 11/12/2023 15:40

I am getting the same on alpha 120 and nightly 11-11

=== @ colin 11/12/2023 15:42

... and the config doesn't appear to affect anything on the 3.0 prerelease? ü§î

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/12/2023 16:05

Ah well. For now pretend resizing is back to not being a thing ü´†

=== @ Rambly 11/12/2023 16:12

(tbh, i would be perfectly okay with resizing *not* being a thing - it's actually very annoying to constantly be accidentally resizing the screen and having to go into the menu to reset the video mode just so the pixel scaling isn't messed up, or in the case of Lock Aspect Ratio on Resize being on, the edges of the screen getting clipped)

=== @ colin 11/12/2023 16:37

lol ok

=== @ Rambly 11/12/2023 18:53

(also i don't necessarily think it should be removed outright, just like, an option to disable it would be nice)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2023 15:02

(replying to @ Rambly "(tbh, i would be perfectly ok‚Ä¶"): I've legitimately not resized the screen accidentally *once*, for the record- not sure how you're having this be a serious issue
...but aye, a setting for that couldn't hurt

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/15/2023 14:36

I tested with a120 now too, resizing both the Player and Creator crashes now consistently. Launcher doesn't have the issue

After adding the allow_live_resize thing to allegro config, the Creator still crashes, but the Player doesn't... interesting hehe
