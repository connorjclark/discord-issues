A slew of issues seem to be present:
- Player is unable to move
- Player is stabbing when slash enabled
- Game->Counter[CR_MAGIC] is 0 when values are set
- Game->MCounter[CR_MAGIC] is 0 when values are set
- Creating a new test data uses the values from test data 1

Were these made awhile ago?

Do these occur with a test init data made recently?

What's the value of a fresh test init data? look in zquest.cfg

Forget answering, I believe I found the issue.

=== @ Deathrider 01/08/2024 02:06

ok good, the test data was created using the version I am actively using

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/08/2024 02:39

is this 2.55 or 3.0

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/08/2024 02:43

a bad merge regressed this for 3.0 (`aa4672`) but 2.55 should be fine...

=== @ Deathrider 01/08/2024 15:24

3.0

should be fixed in prerelease 24
