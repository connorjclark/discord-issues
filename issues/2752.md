alpha 118

Sounds like something I may have addressed already, confirm it's a problem in the latest?

=== @ Anthus 10/16/2023 02:36

the lastest nightly doesn't seem to include the player, is this normal?

but it's in the .zip
oh, looks like windows is being stupid again

idk how to make it not do this, there's no "fuck off, windows" option

=== @ Anthus 10/16/2023 02:41

uhh okay, this is what it's saying for the zplayer, but only the zplayer?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 02:44

I don't know why that's happening, but if you trust us enough to run our executables you might as well tell your AV to ignore the folder you keep ZC in.

=== @ Anthus 10/16/2023 02:45

I do trust you guys tbh, but it's never done this before and it's only the player. I just use windows defender. I don't really see anywhere to mark it as safe
I can look it up tho

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 02:46

118 used python to move files, 119 uses native c++ libraries. totes different now, so maybe wont happen again

=== @ Anthus 10/16/2023 03:15

So I tried to add an exception for the folder for nightlys, and the .zip file itself, but it's still not letting me extract the zplayer file. I can't even get the file itself onto my PC to add it as an exception. I'm not sure what to do short of disabling WD but I don't want to do that either cause it will just flag it anyway when I turn it back on

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/16/2023 03:17

I'll be paying the "protection money" to sign these executables soon, that also may help.

=== @ Anthus 10/16/2023 03:17

I actually got it to mark it as safe right after I sent that
it gave me like five seconds to clikc the thing to allow it
but unfortunately, I can still jump in water in the newest nightly (10.15.23 as of this)

=== @ Anthus 10/16/2023 03:25

(but only if the feather is on anything other than A/B/X/Y)

=== @ Anthus 10/16/2023 03:30

I ran the zplayer.exe through VirusTotal, and literally the only one that flags it is Windows Defender lol
so yeah I definitely don't think it's you guys, just microsoft being dumb/ greedy as usual

(replying to @ Anthus "so yeah I definitely don't th…"): As I always say, antivirus programs are the biggest viruses

=== @ Anthus 10/16/2023 16:28

Yup

=== @ Phosphor 10/16/2023 19:35

I had Malwarebytes previously flag the 32-bit version of a nightly as a trojan as well. I had downloaded it to send to a friend on a 32-bit system.
