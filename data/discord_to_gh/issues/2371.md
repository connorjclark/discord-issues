Ether asked elsewhere if ZC could do player animations with four frame walk cycles instead of recycling a frame like BS animation does. It does seem a little weird that it can't without scripts.

How about "no"
new animation shit sounds absolutely painful
doing anything with player animations that does not involve entirely rewriting player animations from scratch, would be absolutely painful
(Most new animations, like Pitfall, do not give a single shit about what animation style you are in- because every single thing about animation style is jank fuckery)

=== @ Moosh 05/15/2023 01:54

Yeah that's fair. Figured it was worth bringing up on her behalf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/15/2023 02:02

like, legit, every single animation is hardcoded for each and every style

=== @ P-Tux7 05/15/2023 02:08

um
what about z3 style
you can either do 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4 or 1-1-2-2-3-3-4-4
zc has so much tile space now that the duplication doesn't matter

=== @ Moosh 05/15/2023 02:09

I suppose it doesn't, but in the context we were discussing it kinda does a little bit
Otherwise, yes, that works fine

=== @ P-Tux7 05/15/2023 02:10

it does have a 1-frame standing pose but the "freeze in the middle of walking" z1/bs style wouldn't suit an animation fancy enough to require 4 unique frames

=== @ Moosh 05/15/2023 02:11

Or well I'm assuming it works. Never actually used Z3 style because ew, too many frames

=== @ P-Tux7 05/15/2023 02:11

iirc they're the exact same as BS besides the stand/walk frames being 9 instead of 3

=== @ P-Tux7 05/15/2023 02:13

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "like, legit, every single ani…"): this does seem to imply that the animations could read from a unique variable for each replacing the z1/bs/z3 variable, with the appropriate ones getting written in when loading old quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/15/2023 02:13

Yeah, it would imply that
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "doing anything with player an…"): again,
that basically means entirely rewriting player animations from scratch
also, can zscript access link animation style?

=== @ mitchfork 05/15/2023 02:32

yes
```DEFINE ANIM_ORIG = 0; //Animation styles nk
DEFINE ANIM_BS = 1;
DEFINE ANIM_Z3 = 2;
DEFINE ANIM_Z3SLOW = 3;```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/15/2023 02:44

then, yeah, compat for that would break by doing what p-tux suggested- it would require at least a qr
