Currently, the following enemies, which are spawned by combos, screen flags or combo flags:
-Shooter (Fireball)
-Armos
-Ghini 2 (Phantom)
-Rock
-Zora
-Trap (4-way Line of Sight)
-Trap (Vertical Line of Sight)
-Trap (Vertical Continuous)
-Trap (Horizontal Line of Sight)
-Trap (Horizontal Continuous)
are set via checking the relevant flag in the Enemy Editor, and the enemy with the lowest ID that has said flag is spawned when said combo/screen/flag calls for it.

My proposal is to convert these settings to a 0-511 number in Game Settings/GameData that is both settable in ZQuest (in a "default enemies" tab in Game Settings) and readable/writable via ZScript (for difficulty modes). When loading old quests, the enemy flags will be read and then converted to GameData. This is even easier for pre-2.50 quests because the IDs of said enemies in those quests are consistent and were unchangeable.

With this done, this should leave **ten general-use flags** on **every** enemy.

I'd also like to request the enemy IDs of the Projectile-Shooting Fires that flank Guys and Zelda Room Fires to be settable in this menu, too. Currently, they use hardcoded enemy ID numbers.

Firstly, can't be 0-255, max enemies is 511
Secondly, could 2.50.2 ZScript interact with those flags in any way? If so, this simply can't be added until rewrite
Thirdly, that sounds like a lot of work, so even if 1. and 2. are not problems, it won't likely happen any time soon

Oh fuck, I was thinking of items, thanks

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Thirdly, that sounds like a l…"): Yeah well you never know these days. I figured it'd be a good idea to ask due to it presenting you more ZScript possibilities, Deedee because it involves enemy code, or if Connor happens to get the idea in his head as he is wont to do

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Secondly, could 2.50.2 ZScrip…"): @ HeroOfFireZC was that a thing? I wasn't really thinking it could; I recall reading the .qst NPC data or an NPC's current flags to be rather limited in 2.50 and it seems unlikely anyone would have thought to make these read/writable
Sorry for the ping, I figured you were the person here who mucked with modifying Zoras, statues, traps, and whatnot at runtime.

(I recall you being happy when Deedee added Zoras being able to count as beatable enemies [and not always respawn, I think...?])

I was happy deedee did it because I never want to touch enemy stuff, lol
