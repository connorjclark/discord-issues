so @ Attempt if you put `stretch_game_area = 1` in `zc.cfg` under the `[zeldadx]` line, does it fix it?

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:23

fills the window yes, but it ignores the "force integer values" being on

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:24

along with "lock aspect ratio on resize"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/12/2024 11:26

...with that not set to 1, what is the problem?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/12/2024 11:31

..?

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:32

it doesn't properly scale with the window, it only resizes to preset game screen sizes based on the preset game screen resolutions in the ZC->Video Mode settings
so like when the window size is max sized, the game screen is still at the second preset size for example

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/12/2024 11:32

looking at that, it can't get any bigger without breaking force integer values
look at the height

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:33

but even with force integer values off, it does the same thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/12/2024 11:33

err, yeah, because the game window is separate
that's what stretch_game_area is for

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1195323978546417664/1195329766958575646/image.png?ex=65eaf798&is=65d88298&hm=2962f86dafe30deb31391809d2b59eeba3120bdc4273588ce732c1eb090c703a&)
it definitely scales up as big as it can fit normally
and, for the record, using stretch_game_area is not recommended, as it does distort the graphics of the quest
which is probably why it never ended up getting added, because it's a setting that no one wanted

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:35

yeah i know
i just could've sworn that back in the day there was a way where it could get it scaled up to that point without breaking the aspect ratio
and then it no longer happens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/12/2024 11:36

the only two options are `stretch_game_area = 0` and `stretch_game_area = 1`
at no point was anything else working for this

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:37

it was a combination of settings, but i guess that was patched out or changed up where it wasn't the case anymore
where it could fit in like yours could

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/12/2024 11:38

might've seen screenshots while I was working on this stuff
because I tried like, a bunch of jank
but most of it was deemed as "nope, that's not right..."

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:39

because i also recall telling people how to get it to work too
but it's whatever, i'll just stick to small screen i guess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/12/2024 11:40

the other alternative would be adjusting your monitor resolution
to a better aspect ratio
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): ^ like I did for this screenshot, this was as high as I could set it lol
it doesn't get any bigger at my usual small res

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:42

mine's as high as it can go too lol

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:44

hmm, now that i think about it, it  could very well be because it was able to get a bigger game screen on my old pc
that would make more sense
hekk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/12/2024 11:44

well, as high as you can go isn't necessarily best
question is aspect ratio
try some different resolutions

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:45

well as high as it can go is the "recommended" size

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:49

ahh
best i can get is swapping where my taskbar is
that works

=== @ Attempt 01/12/2024 11:51

all well
i'll work with what i got, thanks anyways

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/14/2024 06:20

Fixed.
the intention was "Force Integer Values for Scale" _off_ should fill screen (While retaining) aspect ratio. I believe the code I wrote never respected aspect ratio, but the new code only allowed for integer scaling
defaults are same as ever - int scaling.

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 12:14

Oh dang. Nice

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 12:16

I knew i wasn't crazy lol
Well i thought i was after the fact
But hey it works how i remembered, groovy

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 12:26

Thanks connor

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 19:34

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 
oh whoops, the fix seems to've broken the "Stretch Game Area"

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/14/2024 19:45

Yes, that wasn't a useful thing to have
Why would you want to stretch beyond aspect ratio

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 20:04

idk really, i guess we can just axe the option out of the zc player if ya deem it necessary

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 20:05

(i'm weird and i kinda like the option, makes me nostalgic of how the gba had an option to stretch the resolution of gameboy/gameboy color games to fit the gba screen)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/14/2024 20:10

What option?
I recall it not being shown anywhere visible

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/14/2024 20:11

Maybe I missed it

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 20:12

you pressed the l or r button since they had no function with gb/gbc games
twas a quick lil toggle

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/14/2024 20:13

(replying to @ Attempt "idk really, i guess we can ju…"): I read this as you saying there is somewhere in ZC to enable this option
Not just through the config

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 20:13

OH
it's in the zc player settings

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/14/2024 20:14

Just checking I didn't leave something there I should have  removed

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 20:14

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/14/2024 20:14

Ok, thx
I mean I guess we can keep it...
I may rename it to "keep aspect ratio" tho??

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 20:15

sure
i don't mind what it's named

=== @ Attempt 01/14/2024 20:17

i did add a feature request to also add it to the zc launcher's player settings for convenience
i'm right there with ya that it probably wouldn't be used much at all, but i could say the same for like at least 30% of zc's options
might as well keep it for the sake of things
