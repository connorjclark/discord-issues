`global script Init` is unique. Allowing multiple scripts of that name can cause scoping issues, but adding an annotation `@InitScript()` should be doable. Maybe make it take a weight value? i.e. `@InitScript(1)` will be merged into the main `~Init` BEFORE `@InitScript(2)`?

added:```
@InitScript
    Valid on: Global Scripts
    Function: Mark the script to be merged into the global ~Init slot
    Value: Number, a weight used to determine merge order.
           (the 'global script Init' has a weight of 0)
    Default value: Unset. Setting this to ANYTHING stops the default
                   behavior, and marks the script to be merged.
```
