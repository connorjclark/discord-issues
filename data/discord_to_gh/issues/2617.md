This is an event that fires for every "script timing" used by generic scripts.

I think with this added, a generic script could consist of a single event loop that listens for `while (event = WaitForNextEvent())` (for example); rather than `WaitFor(SOME_TIMING)` done in just the right order.

Could reduce overhead of event system by having a script declare what timings it is interested in

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "This is an event that fires f…"): in this case, would event be the value of the event it landed on, and you could use a switch case to do things based on what event it triggered?
that would probably make it more user friendly I imagine

Yeah event would be the event type. Or a object representing the event with its associated data
I don't know how events work yet . How do scripts lookup it's associated data right now?
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "that would probably make it m…"): Yeah, I think a script structured as an event loop is simpler to write

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I don't know how events work…"): `Game->EventData[]` array
references a global `vector` internally, which gets all the parameters pushed into it
has a size of `0` when no event is active
