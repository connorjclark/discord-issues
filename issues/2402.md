Inspired by Phosphor's recent issues. A QR that makes the hitbox for Bomb/Super Bomb explosions for combos match the hitbox for enemies/Link/Z1 dungeon bombwalls. This does away with the Zelda 1 bombable cave problem where you have to put the bomb exactly on the combo.
that slash didn't go in the title but it ought to in zc

Here is a visualization of how it currently works for combos, for the record

the way i'd describe the current behaviour in the helptext is that the outer ring of either bomb explosion doesn't trigger combos

(but the outer ring always hurts enemies/hero whether the QR is on or off)

That looks a bit better

For the record this is absolute hardcoded horseshit

like my god this feels awful
I have, absolutely, just made arrays of x,y pairs for the offsets it needs to check
which is somehow less jank than what it did before

ahk, so
this got VERY done
