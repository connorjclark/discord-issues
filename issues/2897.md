Zax reported a problem using my ice floors script. 
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=544

Cause turned out to be two boolean functions at the start meant for script compat:
```    bool UserOnExitIce()
    {
        // Things that happen when exiting ice go here
        // If it returns true, the part that runs jumping velocity is skipped
    }
    bool UserDisableIceMovement()
    {
        // Things that disable ice movement go here
    }```

Bug is that having no return statement does not compile error
....which will be a lot of work, likely a new parser pass to scan through each ASTFuncDecl to ensure all paths return

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2023 00:52

Agreed, this should error on compile

What zasm does this generate now? Is it essentially random what the return is?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2023 00:52

Yep

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2023 00:52

Guess no way to resolve that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2023 00:52

"returning" is done by setting d2 register to something
so, it'd just return whatever happens to be in d2
and the simple idea of "just set it to 0 in the one spot"... would make all functions always return `0`, sooo
but, turns out that Moosh was wrong about compat issue
and his script was just *always* broken
(we're in vc)
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....which will be a lot of wo‚Ä¶"): so, a new parser pass, a `ReturnVisitor`, to check that every path has a valid return, would be the best solution I can think of

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2023 00:55

You probably need to learn about control flow graphs now üôÇ
what a coincidence

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2023 00:56

...oh
well we don't really have arbitrary "jumps" of any kind
so control flow is basically linear aside from return statements
(jumps for if/else/etc only jump within the same AST node, same for break/continue)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2023 00:58

so doing a visitor at that level shouldn't be that complex
I'd also add a warn for unreachable code, most likely

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2023 00:59

Ah, so those if/else/call nodes implicitly define basic blocks in a CFG iiuc

Anyhow yeah I'm sure you got it üëç
iiuc you want CFGs to do stuff like register allocation and other optimizations.... Which we don't do much of

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2023 01:00

there's some register optimization for things like switch statements
which, we have an arbitrary number of "registers", soo
that just had `SWITCHKEY` added as a register for it lol
but nothing much more complex than that
so really it just matters that each path hits a `return`, and any code after a `return` in the same AST block is marked unreachable
Can have a compiler option to warn on unreachable code? though the biggest thing is, can trim unreachable code from the ZASM output
which could save a fair bit
the important part to get right is this:
```cpp
bool foo()
{
    if(a)
    {
        return true;
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }
}```
as the function body's `block` does not terminate in any return, but every path of the `if/else` DOES
so, the understanding that a subnode (`ASTStmtIfElse`) counts as a terminator in this situation will be the key of handling this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2023 01:17

feels similar enough at least to the RegistrationVisitor
marking things as reachable and checking that paths terminate, instead of marking things as registered and checking that they are valid
....probably want to try to fix/merge the other parser branch I was working on before this though.
(meta) thread name was changed: No 'missing return' compile error

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2023 09:31

hahahahahaha
I thought this would be difficult
I thought there would be serious effort involved
....I flung my first random attempt at it at a wall, it stuck, and it worked.
