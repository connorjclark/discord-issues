I've ran into a curious new bug and it doesn't make sense to me. Basically a portion of CSET 3 is not being rendered on a custom palette I made and the strange thing it that it otherwise shows up just fine in the palette editor

CSET3 in Palette Editor and CSET 2 in action

uhhh

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/31/2022 05:30

A minor dumb thing on my part
but one that also doesn't make sense because it technically started out as a blank palette, how in the frick did it even have cycle data in it already?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2022 05:32

oh fun
what number palette is it

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/31/2022 05:32

level palette number 32

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2022 05:33

...part of the tileset?
<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>
perhaps it wasn't actually saved blank
maybe there WAS a palette there
and they blanked it
but didn't blank the cycle data
that's the only type of thing I can think of

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/31/2022 05:34

That might be the case
