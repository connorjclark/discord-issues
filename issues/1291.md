I think we should have a touch - next combos where combo tile changes to the next when link touches it whereas step - next combo type which we have when the tile changes when link is completely on it.  This would be essential for crumbling bridge tiles in Zelda 2.

I think, this feature could be implemented as special case of handling step->* combo types for combos that have full or partial solidity.

so, would he touch something solid if he steps next to it, or only if he pushes into it? (Gravity would 'push' down in sideview, of course)
the difference more being, if you had a 1-tall gap, would he touch the floor and the ceiling at once, or only touch the ceiling if he jumps into it?
or, in non-sideview, if you walk along a mountain, are you touching every bit of it, or do you need to push towards the mountain to trigger it?

Top-down: must push against to trigger.
Sideview: sides -> push to trigger. Top -> just step on it, like crumbling bridges in Z2. Bottom -> bonk against to tringger, like Mario.

so, any combo that is inside Link's 16x16 will trigger
and any combo that has its' solidity prevent Link from moving (either from gravity, manual movement, or jumping), will trigger
....not gonna be the easiest to add, but shouldn't be THAT bad.
