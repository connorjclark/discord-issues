Solid if approached from one direction, not the other. Similar idea to sideview platforms, but any direction, and in both view modes.
Special handling will be needed for up-facing ones in sideview; they will need to behave mostly as sideview platforms, but ignoring the drop-through options.

Question: Just link, or other things too? Just link is easy... other things too is more fancy

All. Link, enemies and itemsprites. I already found one-way combos script in database, but it was downvoted by several people as they wanted enemy support since Mario Maker release. Unfortunately, engine enemies do not cooperate well with this kind of stuff, only ghosted ones and only after complete overhaul of their scripts.
