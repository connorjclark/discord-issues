This just successfully compiled
the file path is `foobar/includepathfoo.zs`, and it found it

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅arbitrary include path

ohh

Seems like it wouldn't compose well. For example, given two headers in separate folders using includepath, the order it would append to the include paths list would depend on the order the headers are initially seen in a compilation pass, which may not be defined very clearly (like, swapping the order of includes in an unrelated file could totally break things)

Or is it scoped to just the file it's in? In that case seems fine. But then why not just "include foobar/includepathfoo.zs"?

If someone sends me a script in a `MyQuestScripts.zip`
I can change the `#includepath "MyQuestScripts"`
to `#includepath "../misc/MyQuestScripts"`
to account for me extracting the files to a different directory
and changing it in one place
would affect all of the includes
At the moment, it does have ordering issues; I may try to fix that later, I already fixed ordering issues for most expressions/statements

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 20:28

Could there instead be a list of include paths to use defined in the compiler UI? And used for all future compilations. Just like a normal compiler would do it
I guess that is an extra step but so is "go edit the include path in the source file to match where you unzip it"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:29

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Could there instead be a list…"): That already exists
but it's stored as a zquest config, so it is shared between quests
to store that in a quest file would add an arbitrary amount of file bloat

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 20:30

Ah ok nice

Is the current file being processed's directory also part of the include path? So that relative includes work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:30

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Ah ok nice

Is the current fi…"): No
probably something that could be added, thinking about it
this entire premise has been build up bit by bit just adding things to the parser

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 20:32

Just looking at the provided example, if you did "include foobar/whatever.h" it could be resolved to the current directory just the same. But with no editing needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:32

yes, though there is one difference

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2022 20:32

The "current directory" include path would probably need to be tried first to prevent being squashed by user defined ones

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 20:33

if you `#include foobar/whatever.h`
it will ONLY find it if it is in `[some include directory]/foobar/whatever.h`
if you do `#includepath foobar`
then `#include whatever.h`
it will find it in `[some include directory]/whatever.h`, where `foobar` is now an include directory
