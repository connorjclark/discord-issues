From a point raised by ywkls here:

Certain combo types don't work how they used to in 2.53 if their fields are all set to 0, chests for example. Others like pitfalls don't default to having a falling SFX or damage value. Basic stuff that makes the combo usable in most cases. Since combo wizards are getting default values the idea would be to make changing a combo's type via the drop-down set values to their defaults from the wizard, else clear them to 0. This would be an editor option because some people might be more bothered by accidentally losing their combo settings than having to set them every time.
