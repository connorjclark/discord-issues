@ Saffith @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) (pulling you into the thread)
So, now all widgets have a `useFont` property, for the protected variable `widgFont`; this replaces the `#define FONT` that was in several files

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 14:30

As a test, here's a `Header` button in `saturnfont`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 15:10

Also, you can "border" any widget by setting `framed = true`....
and now you can set `frameText` to make it display a name for the frame- font also applies.
Example:

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/894588827765723146/894602446670807070/unknown.png?ex=65e5e474&is=65d36f74&hm=0d794ed865ef454d18ca1541de8a25a85447592e044a4cd7e78b0edbe5ecd310&)
the `Rows<2>` containing the buttons was set to have a border, and the text `Buttons!!!` in `saturnfont`.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/04/2021 15:45

woo!

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 15:49

y/w
I created  those bitmap fonts:D
pixel b piexel

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 15:52

for that as ong as you use them please attribute the to `The Mages' Gud Societ` or `TMGS`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 15:55

where would you like attribution to be listed?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 15:56

I still  want to mae *user fonts*a thng and it should not be terrbly hard Csto fontst with up to 20 custom fonts loaded via script command (LoadFontFile) for up to 20 user fonts was the plan

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 15:59

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "where would you like attribut‚Ä¶"): In a text file distributed with all modues containing that  fontsdat; same as Isabealla's NSFs

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 16:01

I made all of the new fonts pixel by pixel as bitmaps which makes them into   *original work*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 16:03

if you'd like to provide a credit file for it, I can include it easily

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 16:03

I' write a license and send it to you Clean and simple

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 16:04

same sort of deal as what I made for the NSFs

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 16:06

It was no laughing matter to make all of those fonts
anyway quite OT

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 16:08

feel free to resume your normally scheduled whacamole tourney üòÑ

tea time

=== @ Saffith 10/05/2021 00:22

I pushed some widgets here, though it seems like they're mostly redundant now. https://github.com/Saffith/ZeldaClassic/tree/widgets/src/gui
The big one's the scrolling pane, obviously.
That requires a little assistance from anything that might go inside it; their procs need a wrapper now. So, for instance, the Button now uses `newGUIProc<jwin_button_proc>`.
That forwards scroll wheel messages and requests that the screen bitmap be clipped as needed when redrawing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 16:46

Merge conflicts on grabbing that, obviously
most of which are single lines related to `newGUIProc<>`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 16:49

also you re-organized properties in macros
nothing too difficult, though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 17:22

The scrolling pane code looks absolutely *insane*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 17:43

aaand problem @ Saffith
something wrong with ```cpp
extern int (*gui_mouse_x)(void);// = default_mouse_x;
extern int (*gui_mouse_y)(void);// = default_mouse_y;```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 17:45

unresolved external symbol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 18:01

oh
there's also a warning
```4>C:\Users\Emily\Documents\ZC\ZQSRC255\src\gui\scrolling_pane.cpp(9,28): warning C4273: 'gui_mouse_x': inconsistent dll linkage
4>C:\Users\Emily\Documents\ZC\ZQSRC255\allegro\include\allegro/gui.h(191,1): message : see previous definition of 'gui_mouse_x'```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 18:15

aha
```cpp
extern __declspec(dllimport) int (*gui_mouse_x)(void);
extern __declspec(dllimport) int (*gui_mouse_y)(void);```
that compiles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 18:20

pushed branch `widgets` to main repo, everything resolved

=== @ Saffith 10/06/2021 01:29

Sorry, I'm never around enough to keep up with everything... But you've clearly got the hang of things, so I guess it's okay.
I should clean some things up a bit. List and DropDownList could easily be combined, and I see I left in some debugging code and unfinished comments...

=== @ Saffith 10/06/2021 01:30

There's also still the matter of adding some sort of user data to widgets. I'm thinking Dialog::handleMessage will change to take a single DialogMessage argument with message, argument, and sender fields, or something like that. Shouldn't be a huge change.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 01:31

I'm probably burnt out for at least a few days, so feel free to work on whatever
I basically got around insufficient messaging by giving several widgets a function pointer stored as a property
which makes it easy enough to make them do whatever I need them to

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 01:34

I fucking love lambdas

=== @ Saffith 10/06/2021 01:34

I realized another thing you could do. The message type doesn't actually need to *be* an int in any way - as long as it can cast to and construct from an int, it should work.
So you could make a struct with two short fields, for instance.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 01:34

eh
easier as it is to use the function pointers

=== @ Saffith 10/06/2021 01:35

Fair enough.
Just working around a missing feature either way. I'll get on that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 01:35

```cpp
DropDownList(disabled = isZC, data = list_dmaps,
    selectedValue = isZC ? 0 : local_zinit.start_dmap,
    onSelectFunc = [&](int val)
    {
        local_zinit.start_dmap = val;
    }
)```
function lambdas are just so good

=== @ Saffith 10/06/2021 01:36

They are quite handy.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 01:36

```cpp
#define BYTE_FIELD(member) \
TextField(maxLength = 3, type = GUI::TextField::type::INT_DECIMAL, \
    high = 255, val = local_zinit.member, \
    onValChangedFunc = [&](GUI::TextField::type,std::string_view,int val) \
    { \
        local_zinit.member = val; \
    })```
the fact that I can just make macros like this for building everything is amazing
this gui system is legitimately lifechanging for dev work

=== @ Saffith 10/06/2021 01:38

Good idea. Yeah, glad to see it's working out.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 01:38

`high` / `low` props on textfields set max/min value
and `getVal()`, as well as the `val` param passed to the lambda, are bounded by that
though it doesn't actually restrict while you type, only when it saves
and I added `type::FIXED_DECIMAL`
for gravity/termv
```cpp
case type::FIXED_DECIMAL:
{
    double scale = pow(10, fixedPlaces);
    char templ[20];
    sprintf(templ, "%%.%df", fixedPlaces);
    sprintf(buf, templ, val/scale);
    break;
}
```
```cpp
case type::FIXED_DECIMAL:
{
    double scale = pow(10, fixedPlaces);
    value = int(strtod(buffer.get(), NULL)*scale);
    break;
}
```
variable number of decimal places
defaults to `4`, which handles ZScript ints, but set to `2` for both things that use it now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 01:43

also I love that now we have 2 different methods of framing things
your `Frame()` widget is more adjustable than my method, though
(but mine doesn't take any additional widgets, so more convenient for things that don't need to be fancy)
(I'm just scrolling through the list of files, in case it seems like I'm commenting on fairly random things)
I had to change `Label` a good bit, actually
it wasn't build to call `fitText` multiple times
but, to fit when the container constrains it, it needs to be able to
so, I made it store the original string, and a separate 'fit' string, so it can re-fit it whenever it needs to

=== @ Saffith 10/06/2021 01:46

Yeah, it definitely needed something like that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 01:47

and tweaked the width calculation a bit

=== @ Saffith 10/06/2021 01:47

You've been quite busy, it seems.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 01:47

it wasn't calculating the last line's length
Oh yeah
I kinda just
took a look at the system
and suddenly fell into a black hole of doing things

=== @ Saffith 10/06/2021 01:47

The best kind of hole.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/06/2021 01:47

as soon as I had that *click* moment where I *understood* the system
I just had to get stuff done
and I kept running into issues to fix, so I kept fixing them
the header dialog needed a lot of label fitting, so that exposed all those issues
small mode required a lot of special formatting
and I had a pretty clear set of dialogs that needed converting, especially with QRs, so I just always had a clear goal
Merging tile/side warps into a new dialog will probably be next on the list, but not for a few days at least
re-vamping things like the item editor will take quite a bit of work
but, at the same time, I feel like some real good work can be done to make things much better
which is extremely motivating

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/06/2021 15:27

@ Saffith I am curious: Did this require C++17 or was it usable with c++14 and if the former what new features does it use?
I have not studied changes between 14 and 17
(Never needed 17 before)
Also nice to see you hope that you are well.

=== @ Saffith 10/07/2021 01:16

It could be made to work with C++14, but it would be a hassle. It'd require replacing some things with Boost equivalents and a lot of minor changes.
Right now, it's using `std::variant`, `std::is_invocable`, and `std::string_view`.

=== @ Saffith 10/07/2021 01:18

Besides those, there are a lot of little things like `namespace GUI::Internal {` rather than `namespace GUI { namespace Internal {`, the `[[fallthrough]]` attribute, `std::is_convertible_v` rather than `std::is_convertible<...>::value`...
More little things like that than I can count, really.

=== @ Saffith 10/07/2021 01:20

And there are some subtler things like changes to constexpr and noexcept that might be issues.

=== @ Saffith 10/08/2021 02:38

All right, I got widget user data in. Took a bit more fiddling than I thought, but not a huge change in the end.
Definitely taking a break from GUI stuff for a while. :p

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2021 02:41

looks nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2021 02:42

Did you check out the new downloads page on zeldaclassic.com?

=== @ Saffith 10/08/2021 02:46

Doesn't seem massively different, but I don't really remember it before.
The 2.55 source link goes to the launcher source.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2021 02:46

oh fun
Well, the nice thing is
it's 3 columns
instead of the 3 main downloads being listed each below the previous
and the changelogs no longer make it so you need to scroll for several miles to get past them
so, it's actually feasible to navigate now

=== @ Saffith 10/08/2021 02:47

Yeah, seems to work fine.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2021 02:48

link should be fixed

=== @ Saffith 10/08/2021 02:49

Yep, looks good.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2021 02:49

really easy to work with, honestly
no clue why no one fixed that downloads page after any of the years of complaints

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2021 12:00

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2021 21:20

got it compiling by changing that around a bit

=== @ Saffith 10/09/2021 00:35

Oh, what the hell. How did it take them until C++20 to officially add a C99 feature?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 00:43

Working on #1095 at the moment

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/09/2021 02:49

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "no clue why no one fixed that‚Ä¶"): I never received a complaint, but a lot of the links to archived  files are 404s now thanks to the cloud service frakking them

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/09/2021 02:51

(replying to @ Saffith "Oh, what the hell. How did it‚Ä¶"): The cPP design panel are mostly bloody idiots?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 11:16

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "I never received a complaint,‚Ä¶"): People, including me, complained that you had to scroll past 2.53.0 to get to 2.53.1 and past 2.53.1 to get to 2.55
because when you posted them with the giant changelogs
that meant you had to scroll down *REALLY* far to get to the 2.55 download

Slight re-arrangement of the header dialog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:38

now the help buttons all are attached (0 padding) to the right side of the associated field, the labels are right-aligned to touch the fields, and the boxes at the bottom use a bit more of the available width.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:40

The boxes at the bottom are not *quite* aligned to the columns above them, as at present there isn't a good way to do so. The way to handle such would be to add `rowSpan`/`colSpan` attributes to `Widget`, to be read by `Grid` when adding children; which would then need to be smart about positioning elements to create minimal collisions

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 06:41

that way, each could have a `colSpan = 3`, to span the 3 columns of the `Rows<6>` that is `Label,Textfield,Button, Label,Textfield,Button` above them; thus able to be forced to fit the same width as the 3 columns above (`colWidth[0] + colWidth[1] + colWidth[2] + (2*colSpacing)`, for the left one)
.....not quite up for dealing with adding that at the moment, but it would be very helpful.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 21:20

....so the first attempt at `rowSpan`/`colSpan` didn't go quite too well
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/894588827765723146/900856040692776980/unknown.png?ex=65ea2f91&is=65d7ba91&hm=5128621ea6593d6d122404188a286a70b81121d67f20a3366bbe80182c7caac1&)
but, thankfully, it was a simple stupidity on my part there
(`continue;` was skipping an increment in a loop that needed to not be skipped.... so, call the increment before `continue;`.)
and now

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/894588827765723146/900856317562982440/unknown.png?ex=65ea2fd3&is=65d7bad3&hm=f559b01886d973e7bd19f9735b2a0e9d7a19a848dae7e3264c1fc99e0cc43c5a&)
`Rows<6>`
`(Label, TextField, Button, Label, TextField, Button)`
`(Label, TextField, Button, Nil, Nil, Nil)`
`(Label, TextField, Nil, Label, TextField, Nil)`
`(Label<ColSpan=3>, Label<ColSpan=3>)`
so, the last row contains only 2 elements, but they still span the whole 6 columns
For the header dialog specifically, this makes those a *lot* better centered (they were stuck off-center before, with no good way to fix it)
There is one edge-case here to keep in mind, and not one I care to fix

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 21:26

When you add an element, it has (effectively) a 2d array of bools indicating the positions that are 'taken'. (it's actually an std::map, but using it like an expandable 2d array).
So, basically, when you go to add a new child, it loops through each index, until it finds an index that is free. Once it finds a single free index (a single free 1x1 cell), it places the object there, *regardless* of span properties.
So, for instance, let's say I've placed 2 single-cell objects, in a 5x2 grid (growthLimit=5)
```cpp
1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0```
Now if I place a `rowSpan = 2` object, we get:
```cpp
1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 0```
Now, I'll place 3 more single-cell objects
```cpp
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0```
What happens now if I were to place a `colSpan = 2` object?
```cpp
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 2 0 0```
(given, it's boolean, so it doesn't actually understand the `2` as anything but `true`; though this shows the logical issue, being that 2 objects overlap that cell)
To prevent this, you can simply manually add a `DummyWidget()`
```cpp
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 ```becomes```cpp
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0```
then, add the colSpan = 2, for ```cpp
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1```no overlap
(adding more objects here would expand into a new row, because of how grid growth works; but I kept it to 2 rows for simplicity sake of the demonstration)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 21:31

Basically, what it boils down to, is that it *tries* to be smart with auto-placement, but it isn't necessarily the smartest. In such cases, manual placement padding (which is how *everything* had to be done thus far) still works just fine to get things in the right spots.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 21:44

@ Saffith curious what your thoughts on how I implemented this are: https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/commit/c822d65ac266d2788c4ebc3845d7bd305a1863a5
Using `map` instead of `vector` so that indexes can be skipped

=== @ Saffith 10/22/2021 01:57

Seems all right. I hadn't really thought through how I would do it, so I can't say I had a better idea or anything.
It doesn't look like there's a way to remove a child, is there? I'm thinking you could replace `usedIndexes` with `children.find()`.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 02:02

`usedIndexes` has some indexes marked as used that are `nullptr`
because, if you have a 3x2 cell widget, it "uses" a 3x2 area, but only "occupies" the top-left cell of that area

=== @ Saffith 10/22/2021 02:05

Ah, right.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 02:10

I could make it a `vector<byte>` or `vector<uint32_t>` and use bitwise to use up less space, if that ends up being a concern
but, I'm not sure how much it hurts, especially since unlike the old dialog system it's only in memory while the dialog is open

=== @ Saffith 10/22/2021 02:17

Yeah, it's probably not worth the trouble.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 02:22

This was really the biggest thing missing from grid, frankly
surprised how little trouble it gave me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 02:37

#1131 is up next

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2021 03:27

and woo
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/900935406101594122/900948558293925898/unknown.png
another perfect test of `colSpan`, on that checkbox there

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/27/2021 11:30

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "but, I'm not sure how much it‚Ä¶"): Never use vectors or anything that needs deletion when the stack m3thos auto deletes and conserves space. Avoid heap allocation when ever possible. Here, heap alloc is worthless and addS needless complexity for no benefit.
Vectors excellent when you have variable sized data steams

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/27/2021 11:30

.... which would be the case, there

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/27/2021 11:31

If. You have a set size or an expected size, then don't use a vector

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/27/2021 11:31

The length of the data would increase with every call to `add()`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/27/2021 11:31

I did however post an alt approach to using vectors on mqpsc4, but not without drawbacks
Serious drawbacks
I wanted  to look  at how diff making npcstr would be as a vector

While I could store it as a vector and reduce size over 2.‚Åµ,my test showed that reducing to a vector mean d t 5bat npcstr must be set in order or be ignored
So if next 0,1,2 ,3 and 5 had a str
Only those for 0,12and 3 could be saved,

N0c 4  would be ignored and the str set to npc 5 would drop to npc 4

I wanted to save space,but even with vector size realloc,because of engine design limits, it is hard to find. Spaces where this both saves ram and also works
I did push and show how to do it for those who need or want to try in the future
That push was purely for education

After playing with it for a while I saw that my original. And already instated plan happens to be the best option
Sad, but true

I tried to save ram whenever possible, but the space needed to make a vector, and flag what segments of it are live values is larger than this case.
Some vectors make sense, as does my plan for ZS regs and 2d arrays
