i think it'd be cool and alot easier to keep up with more complex work if you could just add checkmark to the editor window for that screen just so you know everything you've done on that is complete!

honestly it really never is

A very, VERY lazy thing to do to simulate that feature is to create a fully walkable normal boring new combo that looks like a series of extremely visible check-mark shaped colors and such, and put it on a transparent layer of each screen.

When it's time to ship the quest out, all you have to do is go that combo and remove the graphics and animation from it.  The combo will still technically be there on those screens that you know are done, but no one will see it.  If you want to do more work on it, give that combo back its graphics so you'll see that big annoying highly-visible checkmark everywhere on screens you're happy with.

Yes.
