name is `GetEnemy`
num params is `4`

there is no `GetEnemy` in `functions` so this hits the assert and aborts

an aside, this also causes zquest to abort (it doesn't know what to do when the zscript program just crashes like this)

the script i'm compiling is just the default buffer including the standard header

Ah fek, I'm stupid

I only removed one block related to those functions, when I needed to remove both
You should just be able to remove the other part

That shouldn't happen

nvm
I had old headers
