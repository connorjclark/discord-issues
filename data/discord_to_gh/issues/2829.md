[2023-11-06 nightly] rather than writing to buffer `buf[]`, `sprintfa()` appears to simply output to the console, leaving `buf[]` untouched - per the documentation that's what `printfa()` is supposed to do, not `sprintfa()`.

i made a .qst file that demonstrates the expected behavior (with `sprintf()`) and the behavior with `sprintfa()`. screen 00 has an ffc with `sprintf()`, and 01 has the same code with `sprintfa()`

(the code is in the quest file's script buffer, so you can hopefully verify that it's not user error. if it's an error with the script itself, let me know)

i just tested the quest again in 2023-11-07 nightly, and the issue has been fixed. this case can probably be considered closed - thanks Moosh
