Originally I was using 
```.cpp
untyped ChooseArray(untyped arr)
{
    int sz = SizeOfArray(arr);
    return arr[Rand(sz)];
}
```
Which eventually had an issue since it was already defined in engine (assuming it was added so my personal one was not necessary).

However, when using this engine one it was not working.

For context I have an array of combo locations and given some criteria an npc will move towards a random location in that array when calling it 
```.cppint 
litTorches[4];
int allTorches[4] = {upperLeftTorchLoc, upperRightTorchLoc,  lowerLeftTorchLoc, lowerRightTorchLoc};

for(int q = 0; q < 4; ++q)
{
  if(template->ComboD[allTorches[q]] == litTorch)
    litTorches[litTorchCount++] = allTorches[q];
}
...
ChosenTorch = Choose(litTorches);
...
Moves enemy to that torch
```
However, my npc moves towards the top center of the screen as if the y < 0.
Hope this helps!
Upon digging into std_functions it seems there isnt an array Choose function... Perhaps one of the non array ones is being invoked?
or it is stored elsewhere?

Using the internal `Choose(untyped, ...untyped)` function incorrectly. No bug.
