Is it possible to get a button that solidifies an entire combo, and when you press it again it unsolidifies the whole thing?

I wonder if it would be as simple as shift-clicking  the solidity / effect square it to either fill or empty the entire square.

=== @ Jared 02/26/2022 00:47

That could work too!

Love that typo in the title. ü§¶

(replying to @ Jared "Is it possible to get a butto‚Ä¶"): This would be a no, just because of gui clutter....
(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "I wonder if it would be as si‚Ä¶"): ....but this would work.

So, `Shift+Click` on a corner will set the entire square to the OPPOSITE of the corner you clicked
(so, it toggles it, then sets everything to the new value)
but `Ctrl+Click` will just toggle all 4 corners (inverting)

That's amazing.  The perfect solution.  Thanks! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Geezus that was quick.  You rock.  o.o

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 01:10

It checks for shift/ctrl when you press *down* the mouse
even though it waits for you to release to toggle

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 02/26/2022 01:16

It's flawless.  <:NPCNurseThumbsUp:573570441697034281>  Works great on all the squares.  Thanks!
