okay there's one thing i'd really like fixed before 2.55 is finalized, i know it's an enemy thing and not much work is desired to be done until the enemy editor's rewrite starts, but this above everything is what i really want, being the left/right shield orientation.
to where if the enemy is facing up/down, the shield is oriented based on the perspective of the player (aka their left/right), so when the shield is on the left, it's on the player's left rather than the enemy's left, and vise versa for the shield being on the right. but when the enemy is facing left/right, the shield on the enemy is on the enemy's left, and vise versa for the shield being on the right.
i can't tell whether or not the intention is to go by the player's perspective or the enemy's, but either way the orientation is inconsistent with itself and it's bugged me for longer than i'm willing to admit lol.
(luckily the case isn't the same for the player shield)
in fact the player's shield orientation makes me believe that the enemy shield's orientation is supposed to be from the enemy's perspective, since the player's shield is based on the player's perspective
here's an example with the left facing shield
