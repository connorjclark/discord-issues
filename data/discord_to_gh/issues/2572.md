It's not 100% consistent to reproduce, so get the strongest debugging tracers the debug merchant has (but won't sell you because you are not strong enough, traveler) 

So basically, move the elevator down, then climb up the ladder and walk off the platform and fall down onto the middle of the elevator on the button (the protrusion). If you hold Down so you "walk into" the button as you fall, you might get stuck. I don't know what triggers it but if you don't get immediately stuck try moving the elevator a bunch and/or doing a few laps yourself. Also button mashing movement buttons when you're just about to land on the button seems to do it. It's kinda random. Walking erratically on the elevator as it moves might also do it. 

Also, sometimes, Link will be unable to walk onto the elevator as if running into an invisible wall, even though the elevator is perfectly flush with both platforms. 

It shouldn't take too long to reproduce, maybe a minute tops. So absolutely do all the tracing you can

Latest nightly.

made a replay capturing it; I'll build a debug and trace it later

Is this still broked?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2023 14:19

ah shoot, thanks for reminding

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2023 21:16

@ Majora can you make the bug happen still (and record a replay plz)?

=== @ Majora 12/04/2023 22:14

player no longer gets stuck in elevator when walking into it while falling
however, the button on the elevator no longer shows prompt if you walk off the ledge and fall onto the elevator on your side. that is, if you never press down before you land and the last direction you pushed was right

well I guess a replay isn't needed exactly for the button thing but yeah the button on the elevator itself stops being interactable after falling

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2023 22:20

"no longer" so it worked before eh?

=== @ Majora 12/04/2023 22:21

I don't remember if the button prompt stopped appearing after falling down <:screamingcat:1134153144192991365>
in a previous build
I wanna say it didn't and was part of the getting stuck behavior
