This has always been a pet peeve for me, but is there any way that we can have an option in ZQuest that we can swap CSet 14 )which I believe is the default boss palette) or whatever the boss palette is now, for one of the extra palette sets (like bosses) so we could use it, through a dialog box in ZQuest?  It would be greatly appreciated

Disregard, problem solved in another manner
