Discovered when doing a playthrough of 1st quest, the shutters in Ganon's room open upon his defeat instead of upon picking up the Triforce (whole) item. This differs from the original Z1 behavior, where the shutters open once the triforce has been collected from atop Ganon's ashes. I initially noticed this in the actual 1st.qst but had my save wiped after interacting with Zelda. I reproduced it by importing the 1st.qst version from 2.50.2 and demonstrating it in test mode.

With how often people bother playing through Z1 nowadays through ZC, who knows how long this has been a bug?

I thought this was fixed? I reported it in #deleted-channel

Is this a bug in that it used to "work" how you describe it - or that it just doesn't match what Z1 does?
In general, we don't have much interest in 1:1 matching Z1.
Not saying we shouldn't fix it if its just "doesn't match Z1", just that it isn't high priority.
I guess it's kinda funny how you can just ignore the Triforce. Kinda sweet, Link just wants Zelda, not Power.

Wait, no, it is a new bug, not related to the former one
And it did used to work like the NES, even in 2.55, which can break replays
