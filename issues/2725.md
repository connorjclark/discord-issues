A screen flag intended for cutscene usage that prevents low health heart beeps from happening, whether or not the user has them turned on.

If this is for usage w/ cutscene combos, can we just disable it always when that is active?

I wouldn't say always, I'd make it a flag on the cutscene trigger type

Yeah
...sorry, forgot that combo existed
