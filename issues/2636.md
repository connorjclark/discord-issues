Please add item flags for the following itemclasses that make their projectiles die upon contact with solids if it is flagged:

-Swords (applies to the beams)
-Boomerangs
-Arrows
-Candles
-Wands
-Books (applies to the fire)
-Din's Fire
-Byrna

The dying is just the typical dying that happens when they hit a combo that blocks them or on an enemy set to block them.

makes sense and there's literally a weapon flag to handle the dying already, but 8 separate item flags need to be added in 8 separate places of the gui and 8 separate places of the engine to add that, so it's not a small amount of work...
