yeah... the top ones are the "extra" ones, really

matches this in ZQ
...don't remember why those were there originally
there was a reason at some point
...oh, wait, right
because the ipsum text on the right can become abnormally large depending on the user's configs
which can make the bottom ok/cancel buttons unusable on some settings
making it impossible to FIX your settings, as you can't 'OK' making it smaller
similarly to how they currently appear scrunched up in ZC
but the bottom buttons are needed for other *tabs* of the options dialog
...not sure what we wanna do here
