I'm surprised this hasn't been reported yet but I've been running into a peculiar bug where link's falling down a hole animation plays twice when falling down a hole.

....what??

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/22/2022 01:36

Yeah. I've been noticing it on my end especially when falling down bottomless pits from certain directions

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 01:36

What animation style (can you test them all?)

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/22/2022 01:49

I'm using the BS Animation Style for my link and I have just finished flighing myself into a hole in multiple directions, it plays fine when you're falling into a hole from the west (right) but plays twice when falling into a hole from the east (left), north (down) and south (up)

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/22/2022 01:51

curiously enough, this glitch actually also shows up in the player sprite editor as well.

=== @ Moosh 05/22/2022 02:54

Falling down pits has an unusual number of frames across all animation styles. So could it be that instead of a 7(?) frame animation you're playing a 4 frame animation multiple times or something?

=== @ Moosh 05/22/2022 02:57

Which could also explain it being different for different directions because some directions would hit blank tiles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 03:20

@ Moosh that, in fact, would be exactly the issue
@ FireSeraphim you have the tiles set up wrong
falling is 7 frames

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 03:21

it's "playing twice" because it's doing the 4 tiles for that dir, then 3 tiles from the next dir

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/22/2022 03:21

Strange, I was under the impression it was 3-frames since the right facing one seems to play correctly. I think an option to force a 3-frame falling animation for link would be ideal.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 03:21

and facing right doesn't play twice, because there isn't another dir after right, so those are blank tiles

Right is playing those 7 tiles

=== @ Moosh 05/22/2022 03:22

So the way to do 3 frames is...yeah that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2022 03:22

Now, since you don't actually have any difference between different directions here, you could just set all 4 dirs to use the one set of 7 tiles

these are what it's playing for each dir

I see.

this would fix it, where all 4 dirs are set to the same tile
or, you could add more frames to the animation to stretch it out
Falling takes 70 frames, with aspeed of 10
thus 7 tiles
