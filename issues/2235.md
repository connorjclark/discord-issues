This would function like DeadState, only it wouldn't turn off the weapon's collision. It wouldn't be a timer that counts down to 0 and if it hits 0 (not if it's at 0), it sets the weapon's deadstate as if it has been killed. Currently to have weapons that die after a time, they need either a global script or a weapon script to manage their lifespan. This isn't bad, but feels like something weapons ought to just...do. The immediate use for this I frequently find is single frame hitboxes on special objects like say an enemy's sword. 

If a lifespan is infeasible, then a weapon type that just dies the frame after it's created would be the next most useful alternative.

basically just have it act like a sparkle, but with a timer instead of an animation playing?

Sparkle lweapon type works wonkily with enemy defenses.

=== @ Moosh 03/15/2023 18:32

Oh yeah, I keep forgetting damaging sparkle exists. Though I don't believe it does for eweapons and has some odd properties as alucard pointed out

Doesn't the Fire Boomerang have the ability to have damaging sparkles? I may have seen damaging sparkles for Gold Arrows too

`lweapon->Timeout`/`eweapon->Timeout`. If it's >0, it ticks down by 1 per frame. If the engine ticks it down from 1 to 0, the weapon dies.
(meta) thread name was changed: weapon->Timeout

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Moosh"): This is excellent

=== @ Moosh 03/16/2023 18:22

Little detail I'm wondering. Should weapon types like the arrow here use their special deadstate animations like they would in other situations where they die?
Arrow creates the impact sprite, sword creates beam shards, boomerang bounces

=== @ Moosh 03/16/2023 18:26

Actually unsure which would be more helpful. An arrow poofing on nothing looks a little weird but the beam shard animation is cool and bouncing back is pretty much the only reason you'd use a boomerang
