I thought you have to specify the midi on that screen?
That's what the tooltip seems to imply

IDK, see if it changes anything
even if it is a bug it could be a bug that the qr affects

=== @ Phosphor 11/28/2023 03:02

yeah that fixed it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/28/2023 03:03

having it on, or off?

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "having it on, or off?"): it was on by default and I turned it off to fix it
was a bit confusing to have it as the default behavior
