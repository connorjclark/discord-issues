This has two components:
1. Killing all beatable enemies in a boss room makes all the non-beatable enemies disappear as well
2. The non-beatable enemies will not spawn when any boss room on the current DMap is entered. This is similar to and in addition to how, currently, beatable enemies do not spawn if the room is a boss room and the boss room cleared flag is true.

This is to allow for boss rooms with hazards like statues, traps, Zoras, and Bubbles, but that do not unfairly kill or jinx the player after the boss dies or should they return to the boss room.
