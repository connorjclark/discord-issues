ZC has `resx`/`resy` configs. What should happen with the new resizing stuff is, it should ignore these, always using `320x240`; but then resize to the configured value using the new resizing stuff immediately

this would fix menus not scaling properly

this seems to be working pretty well
i went with 640x420 tho
320x was teeeeeeny

fair
as long as the menus/dialogs are readable on a high-res monitor, that should do fine
