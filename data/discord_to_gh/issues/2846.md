nov 13 nightly
- deleting/undoing edits to a tile don't work. the tile still retains what was there, even if it was "deleted". 
- the edited/deleted tiles don't appear in the tile viewer - they only show up in the editor.
- overwriting the tiles via copy/paste etc appears to be a workaround for the time being.

> deleting/undoing edits to a tile don't work. the tile still retains what was there, even if it was "deleted".

Can you be very specific here? I tried various undo / redo / clear stuff in the tile editor and the tile page, and I can't figure out what you saw.
i need a step-by-step please, what keys to press (be in the tile editor or the tile page?)
does tile page have a redo at all? `U` is undo but there seems to be no redo.
I know tile editor it is `U` to toggle the last change (undo and redo).
"Delete" == clear, or remove tile?

=== @ tacochopper 11/15/2023 03:11

undo being U
i'll just record a demo one sec

=== @ tacochopper 11/15/2023 03:16

delete being remove tile i suppose

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2023 03:17

(replying to @ tacochopper ""): so uhhh.... deleting and undoing and everything you showed here? Works 100% fine for me
so uh... either your build got somehow corrupted, or it's quest specific to your quest file?

=== @ tacochopper 11/15/2023 03:18

unsure about the latter, could be the former
may have to try with a fresh install

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2023 03:20

does it occur in a `File->New` file?

=== @ Attempt 11/15/2023 10:06

i'd like to add to this. it's a super weird thing where if i try to flip a tile after rotating it, it reverts back to the previous rotation instead, then starts flipping after you try to flip it after it rotates back

"insert" and "remove" right click options are swapped ..

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/16/2023 05:00

fixed in nightly
Never reprod original report but possibly fixed too. Lmk tacochopper

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/18/2023 17:40

marking as fixed

=== @ Attempt 11/18/2023 18:11

yeah i tried to replicate that issue myself but no dice
granted i'm using the lastest nightly so it could very well have been fixed

=== @ Shane 11/20/2023 14:55

i'm getting similar issues to taco. the u key doesn't work. cancelling out of editing a tile still stores the data i guess?
i'm using the 19th november build.

=== @ Shane 11/20/2023 14:56

also deleting the tile also doesn't remove it.
so basically i have the same issue as taco.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/20/2023 14:58

do you see these things in a new file?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/20/2023 16:18

> the u key doesn't work

@ Shane  in tile editor or page?

FYI: in the tile _page_ U is a one-way thing (at least, since A116), you can't use it to toggle the last edit like how the tile editor does. Were you seeing that?

=== @ Shane 11/20/2023 17:24

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "do you see these things in a…"): Yes
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "> the u key doesn't work

<@9…"): Tile editor, it works in page.

=== @ Shane 11/22/2023 02:00

so update
i downloaded and extracted the latest zc into a new folder and apparently the bug doesn't persist.
i think something windows defender did a couple of versions back fucked something up in my zc folder?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/22/2023 02:11

...well, that's fun

=== @ Shane 11/22/2023 02:14

im not sure if that was it, but that's my guess.
genny did mention she had the bug when messing around with protection options
but i couldnt reproduce those results

=== @ Attempt 11/22/2023 02:50

and i couldn't reproduce it when i tried to another time :p

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/22/2023 02:52

(replying to @ Shane "i downloaded and extracted th…"): same config, same quest?

=== @ Shane 11/22/2023 02:52

yep

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/22/2023 02:53

If you have the old folder still, can you archive it and send to me?

=== @ Shane 11/22/2023 02:53

oh sure thing

=== @ Shane 11/22/2023 03:14

sent, hopefully something can be found? otherwise ill just take the fix in the new folder.

=== @ Shane 11/24/2023 14:55

so i got the bug again. i think it might have something to do with tile protection.
i think it started happening when i accidentally triggered tile protection

=== @ Shane 11/24/2023 14:59

going to test with a new download to see if this is the cause

=== @ Shane 11/24/2023 15:07

hm i can't reproduce it.
damn

=== @ Shane 11/25/2023 18:33

update: the bug can be fixed if i set up a combo.
also this does look to be exclusively a tile editor thing, the tile pages are fine.
also moving the tile around in the editor with arrow keys has some weird delay, hard to explain.

=== @ Shane 11/25/2023 18:39

pressing right a few times, but i press up and it goes right again at least once before registering me pressing up

=== @ Shane 11/25/2023 18:50

...nvm i can't replicate this fix

=== @ Shane 11/26/2023 05:43

OK, I managed to find when the bug started up (again)
I somehow opened up the save prompt inside the tile editor (the page part)
I don't know how I managed to cause the save prompt to sappear.
I accidentally clicked the top left corner and it justh appened.

=== @ Shane 11/26/2023 05:46

I had two editors also open and the bug reappeared on both..?

=== @ Shane 11/26/2023 06:56

this is causing it.
