Using the latest build.
When you edit a string and attempt to open the tile page to pick out a portrait, then exit the string editor. The string window looks like this, with the blue background covering everything. This seems to just be an aesthetics thing though, and doesn't seem to break anything.

feels like a `popup_zq_dialog_start()`/`popup_zq_dialog_end()` mismatch somewhere?
Either that or something in that tile page is just nuking the `screen` bitmap at an odd time

This issue is still present in the newest nightly.
Oh wait, a new one came out yesterday.

probably still present, I didn't touch this
(low prio since it's just aesthetic)

. . . fixed.
It was just... doing a weird partial-redraw thing
for.... no discernable reason?
(literally fixed by *removing 1 line of code*)
