ZC version: 2.55 Alpha 97 hotfix.

Signposts don't appear to be functioning anymore. They do nothing whereas they worked in previous nightlies.

NVM
Dumb default control configs

Oh lol

=== @ Orithan 10/01/2021 06:16

But I have another bug report - You can lens through signs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/01/2021 06:16

??

=== @ Orithan 10/01/2021 06:17

The lens still runs when you interact with signpost

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/01/2021 06:17

That's annoying

=== @ Orithan 10/01/2021 06:17

The lens runs while pressing to interact with signpost, before and after the string

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/01/2021 06:18

Guessing a timing issue?
I'm away from home for a bit, I'll look at it when I get home tomorrow

....oh
it's eating a press input
but it doesn't disable the hold state
the lens ignores the press state

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 10:53

this should fix it

Nope. Just makes the signpost instead trigger when you move up to it with the button held
It interrupts the lens drawing but then it gets called up again after the fact

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 12:45

Ah crap, missed that first part
... the lens getting called after is kinda gonna happen
Because the lens doesn't trigger when you press the button
It triggers when the button is held

@ Orithan this should fix the moving up to it
but yeah, there really is no way to prevent it going *after* the sign.
