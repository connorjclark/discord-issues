Sorted out *my* memory issue, which indeed is a separate one from the one deedee and I found the other day
and have the first tab of an FFC Editor done
(The `Script` dropdown will be on the tab with the init d)

Also, note the lit up line on the tabpanel.
Now if you focus a tabpanel (i.e. by clicking on it), it will be visually indicated by a highlighted line under the selected tab
While focused, pressing `Left` and `Right` will cycle through tabs.

Also: Now when you `Place and edit FFC #`
if you `cancel`, it won't place anything down
(before this update, cancelling would *still* place the ffc with the cursor's combo at the cursor's location)
