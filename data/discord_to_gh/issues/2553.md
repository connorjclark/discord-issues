July 23rd nightly: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876906918847852594/1132652164599255113

Just simply exiting the subscreen script with Start here causes ZC to crash and automatically close on this nightly.

Allegro prints the following to the console ``Stack over or underflow, stack pointer = 0``

A replay is provided here.

It appears the RNG desyncs Frame 1 of this replay on the same nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 05:46

#2534 @ Moosh probably related? might wanna get that pushed if its' fixed

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 05:46

Heyy guess who just pushed a fix for that

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 05:48

...I didn't test my fix on DMap scripts. feck. Hoping it just worked, it worked on all the other types I could think of. Fingers crossed this one's fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 05:50

launch a nightly too (Repo page, `Actions` tab, `Release` button in left menu, `Run Workflow` dropdown in the top-right, just hit the green `Run workflow` button without changing anything)

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 05:51

Was waiting on replay tests, though I guess it's a compiler change so the script tests are the only ones that matter...which I manually reviewed and updated

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 05:55

(replying to @ Moosh "Was waiting on replay tests,…"): uhhh...replay test failed because choco failed?!?
does that just happen sometimes @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 05:56

yep

=== @ Orithan 07/27/2023 06:20

The new nightly only appears to have a Linux build

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 06:23

Yeah some jobs failed and TIL apparently when that happens it posts it anyways. Should hopefully update to add the missing ones

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 07:12

(replying to @ Moosh "Was waiting on replay tests,…"): FYI there is also this test, which recompiles the scripts for `playground.qst` and then re-runs those replays: https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/blob/main/tests/test_zquest.py#L59
If you ever run it locally, note it modifies the qst file locally and that should not be committed.

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 07:14

Oh I was not aware of that. Good to know for future

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 07:28

(replying to @ Orithan "The new nightly only appears…"): windows builds should be live now

=== @ Orithan 07/27/2023 07:38

Nope, crash was not fixed

=== @ Orithan 07/27/2023 07:46

It's putting me at a login screen

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 07:46

(replying to @ Orithan "Nope, crash was not fixed"): When recompiled, does it still print this
```Allegro prints the following to the console Stack over or underflow, stack pointer = 0```

=== @ Orithan 07/27/2023 07:52

Still happens after recompiling the script
```
Invalid pointer (14) passed to array (don't change the values of your array pointers)
Stack over or underflow, stack pointer = 0
```

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 07:58

Okay so whatever's doing that is probably unrelated to the other bug, cuz I just tested subscreen scripts and they worked

=== @ Orithan 07/27/2023 07:59

I'm getting no errors on the build I am currently working with

=== @ Orithan 07/27/2023 08:04

I'll check to see where this problem first started

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 08:07

(replying to @ Orithan "It's putting me at a login sc…"): it's just a crash report for us developers to debug
speaking of which, I'll add you Moosh

=== @ Orithan 07/27/2023 08:09

The crash starts from the 17th July nightly
I'm currently operating on the 16th July nightly, which is running the script with no problems

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 08:10

(replying to @ Orithan "The crash starts from the 17t…"): that lines up with the first crash report we got

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 08:14

There's a couple of different changes this could relate to, I'll bisect it tomorrow.
I can repro by using any subscreen script? Maybe you could just give me your qst to test directly with.

=== @ Orithan 07/27/2023 08:17

Sure

=== @ Orithan 07/29/2023 15:50

Any updates on this?
I need this to get fixed sooner than later because my project relies on scripting and the nightly I am working on broke script stuff

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 15:54

(replying to @ Orithan "July 23rd nightly: https://di…"): for the record a replay is 100% useless without the corresponding `.qst`
also further information might help
based on what I'm seeing in the crash report, you're using `class` stuff?

=== @ Orithan 07/29/2023 15:55

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 15:55

(It seems to be crashing when it tries to destruct the class object)
weirdly enough, on THIS line?

=== @ Orithan 07/29/2023 15:56

```
~SelectItem()
{
    //Nothing
}
```
This is the destructor for the relevant class

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 15:57

....hmm.

=== @ Orithan 07/29/2023 15:57

```
//Contains common subscreen settings and functions
class SelectItem
{
    char32 Label[65]; //The element's label. This is automatically set by the item's name.
    int X, Y;    //Their X/Y values
    int Itemclass; //The itemclass the element corresponds to. If set to -1, the Item is used instead.
    int Item; //The item the element corresponds to. If set to -1, the raw graphical data is used instead
    int Tile, CSet; //Graphical data.
    int TileWidth, TileHeight; //Size
    int AFrames, ASpeed, ADelay, ASkipX, ASkipY; //Animation data
    bool Visible; //The element is currently selectable
    int ID; //Element's ID
    int Select[4]; //The directions the cursor moves when going in the four cardinal directions: Up, Down, Left, Right.
    SelectItem()
    {
        Itemclass = -1;
        Item = -1;
        TileWidth = 1;
        TileHeight = 1;
    }
    void DrawToScreen(int layer, int opacity)
    {
        if(Tile > 0)
            Screen->DrawTile(layer, X, Y, Tile, TileWidth, TileHeight, CSet, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, true, opacity);
    }
    void DrawToBitmap(int layer, bitmap screen, int opacity = OP_OPAQUE)
    {
        if(Tile > 0)
            screen->DrawTile(layer, X, Y, Tile, TileWidth, TileHeight, CSet, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, true, opacity);
    }
    ~SelectItem()
    {
        //Nothing
    }
}
```
The full class declaration

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 15:57

(Easy solution, if you don't need anything in the destructor just ***don't use one***)
(If you provide one, even an empty one, it has to go through a METRIC FUCKTON of work to make the destructor work)
(...and with no destructor, the spot where it's crashing won't even be *reached*, so it would probably stop crashing on you)

=== @ Orithan 07/29/2023 16:00

Okay, the empty destructor was what causing the crash

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 16:00

New question, is it just it being empty that crashes?
like, does adding `Trace(1);` stop it from crashing?

=== @ Orithan 07/29/2023 16:01

Nope
It still crashes with a trace

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 16:01

ahk, so that's not ***the cause of the crash***
but, having no destructor works around the crash
so that works for now
@ Moosh ready to have fun learning classes?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 16:05

(meta) thread name was changed: Destructor Crash

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 22:51

It wasn't crashing for me (on mac).

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/22/2023 09:41

Was this fixed @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2023 09:42

Don't recall
Which means probably no?

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 11:40

Yeah I haven't touched this one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 04:50

...also noting that there's not actually a test quest posted here to reproduce the crash

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2023 21:16

@ Orithan does this still occur for you?

=== @ Orithan 12/04/2023 22:53

Have not tested it in a long while

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2024 20:01

k, so, I found SOMETHING fucky
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1192736536484139028/1193282772303880365/image.png?ex=65ac262f&is=6599b12f&hm=79bac79542602287987884d957d5473a43f7429db7cad329e2bb5c3b1e160f79&
a printf here works fine, but `Trace(-1)` throws a fuckton of random errors...
well, not *random*, it's always those specific errors
An empty dtor vs a dtor that's like 2 opcodes long and doesn't touch the stack at all, feel pretty similar...
....is the SP somehow fucked at the start of the dtor?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2024 20:06

The thing here is that the generated ZASM looks correct
```cpp
 STARTDESTRUCTOR "Car2"; Func[void ~Car2()] Body Start
 SETR d4,SP
 TRACEV -1; InlineFunc[void Trace(untyped)] Params AND InlineFunc[void Trace(untyped)] Body
 RETURNFUNC; Func[void ~Car2()] Body End```

. . . . . . .
issue fixed....
presumably this was an incorrect attempt at fixing something else previously, which has since been fixed a different proper way, and this just never got undone...
not sure if this would have caused a *crash* though... but definitely feels relevant to the issue.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/06/2024 20:42

this can def. cause a crash. call this enough and sp underflows to max uint32, then writing to stack could corrupt random memory (sp is only bounded when modified, but not before just being used)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/06/2024 20:43

oh, except there is a bounds check in the read/writes `if(stackoffset >= MAX_SCRIPT_REGISTERS)` ...
idk why that is named MAX_SCRIPT_REGISTERS
should this be MAX_STACK_SIZE

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2024 20:45

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "this can def. cause a crash.…"): and the refinfo is cleared before this, so uh, no it wouldn't
as it's always `0` before that decrement

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/06/2024 20:48

Oh, that cleared it first. so then sp starts at 0...then was decremented to max uint32_t?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2024 20:50

yep, every time
which was making... every single opcode throw a stack overflow error
the printf version didn't have the error, as one of the first things it would do is PUSH, which moves the SP back into valid range

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 09:56

K, we marked this closed without being sure
and the answer is it was not fixed
but @ Moosh just found the stupidest damn mistake in the code
and 1-line fixed a huge issue with these
1-line, of course. Fuck me.
