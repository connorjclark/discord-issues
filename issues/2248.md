@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 
Test quest attached

Map 2, Screen 3B

Test the quest and you'll find that two of the Moldorms always get stuck in odd positions. Luckily, it isn't the "Moldorms get stuck to the edge of the screen" bug from the earlier alphas, but it's clearly something.

This is an old, unscripted quest, and there are no No Enemies flags. Moldorms aren't supposed to interact with Liquids, are they? It seems like something about the combo types and them hitting the perfect intersection gets them stuck.

Before you attach a test quest, make sure it's unpassworded, so developers can address bugs that come up.

passwords are meaningless to us

=== @ P-Tux7 03/23/2023 03:14

Just found another issue - https://www.zeldaclassic.com/resource-listing/entry/60/
Map 10 Screen 50
The Digdoggers seem to get stuck on combos too
(meta) thread name was changed: Diagonal enemies getting stuck
I suppose it's diagonal enemies now
I wonder if the issue is related to 1.90 or lower quests and their handling of Liquid combos

=== @ P-Tux7 03/23/2023 03:20

Now it's happening with bog-standard Blue Keese in Map 10 Room 63

=== @ P-Tux7 03/23/2023 03:21

They... might be refusing to cross liquid?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/23/2023 03:23

Uh oh, the enemies aren't getting read as "Can Walk on Liquid". But in newly-made quests they are

=== @ P-Tux7 03/23/2023 03:27

Okay so, in ALL pre-2.5 quests enemies of the below classes should get treated as "Can Walk on Liquids" and probably "Can Walk on Pitfalls", so that even though there are no pre-2.55 pitfalls, tilesets from earlier ZC versions will work right in this regard

-Keese/Flying
-Ghinis
-Peahats
-Digdoggers
-Moldorms
-Aquamentus
-Manhandlas
-Gleeoks (for their heads)
-Gohmas
-Patras

-Idk about Other and Other -> Floating?

-NOT Ganon. He cannot walk over water in any previous version of ZC.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/23/2023 13:52

won't be able to fix for a couple days

=== @ P-Tux7 03/23/2023 19:28

(Can now confirm that Gleeok's flaming heads DO have this issue)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/31/2023 01:39

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) please look into this further because i have a hankering for making some more old quest replays

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/31/2023 05:47

My computer is out of commission and I won't be able to do any devwork until it returns from being fixed

=== @ P-Tux7 04/07/2023 21:05

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/07/2023 21:06

banned for ping
anyways I'll take a look at this

=== @ P-Tux7 04/14/2023 00:54

...aw fuck, this stuff gets saved in the .qst file, doesn't it?
do we need a wizard for this or something or do we just tell everyone who's saved a quest in 2.55 they need to update all their keese

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/16/2023 18:19

@ P-Tux7 is this the same as https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=77981&p=1072510

=== @ P-Tux7 04/16/2023 18:20

yup
when opening these quests it shows that the flag "can walk on water" is erroneously unchecked for the enemy classes in the first post
(well, they don't walk, but it still prevents them from flying/whatever on liquid/water tiles)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/16/2023 18:23

Then it could be an issue with qst loading / compat.
I don't know, Deedee would know better
Go ahead and keep doing replays for whatever quests you want. we can keep the bug for older replays easily.

=== @ P-Tux7 04/16/2023 23:20

i think this might be tied to whether the quest in question being opened has solid water on, which all below-2.50 quests do by default

=== @ P-Tux7 05/17/2023 03:09

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) this one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/17/2023 03:09

oh, brain. Had you said "diagonal" instead of "flying" my brain would have connected it to this report lol

=== @ P-Tux7 07/15/2023 22:11

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @ P-Tux7 08/23/2023 16:56

oh yeah @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) since you mentioned wanting to fix bugs yesterday

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/12/2023 19:31

I marked this as high priority as it is a jaring compat issue for some older quests that enemies can't fly over water

=== @ Shane 09/24/2023 02:21

Any updates on this?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/24/2023 06:00

okay yeah I need to stop procrastinating on this sorry

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/27/2023 12:33

(my sleep schedules been wack and I've barely been awake, but I haven't forgotten, looking into it right now)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/27/2023 13:28

sorry for the delay, found the issue

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/27/2023 13:29

backwards compat stuff for moveflags was only applying if the quest was 2.50 or newer

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/27/2023 13:57

was a bit annoying to fix; had to do it manually for every enemy instead of by type, but should be fixed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/27/2023 14:00

really sorry for taking so long for something where the issue was kinda obvious

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/27/2023 14:02

I tested it myself but because I had to do it manually per enemy please let me know if I missed one or if one of them has something they shouldn't

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/29/2023 07:14

@ P-Tux7 @ Shane latest nightly will have Deedee's fixes, let us know if you find more of the same issue

=== @ P-Tux7 09/29/2023 07:30

Thanks. I'll check in some old quests tomorrow to see if the bug is fixed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 22:07

@ P-Tux7 any chance you could take a look at the fix here?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/08/2023 00:25

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) Sorry, had a rough finals week. Is this in the latest nightly?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2023 00:26

Yup!

=== @ P-Tux7 10/08/2023 00:44

Tested Return to Dreaming Island (1.84, the quest I first noticed it in.) All Enemy Editor flags are set correctly, as well as Keese and Moldorms behaving correctly when tested

=== @ P-Tux7 10/08/2023 00:46

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) It seems you have done it. Thank you!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/08/2023 00:50

Np!
Sorry for the delay
That did not need to wait 6 months

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2023 00:52

Thanks for checking!
