Seconding, this would be very useful. If it’s not to happen, I do have a script I could share at least

It won't automatically handle a scripted jump, though scripts can directly access `Hero->CoyoteTime`:```
int CoyoteTime;
 * The number of frames the hero has been off the ground. Range 0-65535.
 * 0 while standing. When not standing, ticks up by 1 each frame.
 * When jumping, is immediately set to 65535.
 * If this value is < 65535 and < a feather's "Coyote Time" attribute,
 *     the feather will be able to jump despite being in the air.
 * Setting this to 65535 will disable coyote jumps, though this will be set to
 *     0 upon landing on the ground again.```

Thanks. This will reduce frustration for precise jumping. Although default coyote time should be 3-5 frames.

yeah probably lol
I set it high there to make it blatantly easy to test
