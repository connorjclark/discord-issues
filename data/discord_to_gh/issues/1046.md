Quest Icons change after saving quest, but not after loading quest or reloading quest after shutdown.  Just back to default quest icons

oh yeah i noticed years ago and reported it on the old server. this applies to getting a ring and then BEATING a quest without saving as well
it may be tricky to write it to the save file without saving the rest of the game as well

but wait, that's odd... isn't the game saved after winning it? i wonder what the issue is here

no, p-tux, that's unrelated
this is a bug with the `reload_game_icons` config
