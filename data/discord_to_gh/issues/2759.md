This is due to a penalty being paid for swapping the bitmap being rendered to. Kinda seems like an oversight on allegro's part, but maybe we're doing things quite wrong.

A simple workaround would be to have RenderTreeItems have a callback method, which gets called during the `render` fn, instead of holding onto a a5 bitmap. That way, we can keep the layering feature but only ever draw to the display's backbuffer. Bonus, we aren't holding a bitmap the size of the entire screen to draw in a little corner of it.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "A simple workaround would be…"): ooh, I like this

I removed a couple `rest()` calls in the main loop for the editor and it's perfect 60 FPS now <:LinkShrug:943782713788342272>
from 30
I also added the player's throttleFPS thing to be more smart about how long to sleep between frames

Hiding the tooltip RTI when not used (and making that bitmap only as big as it needs to be) is needed for 60 fps.

However for some reason only in web version (it use opengl shaders) the mini map only draws if the tooltip render tree item draws! Big wtf.

So I went ahead with the callback thingy I mentioned, got it working for the minimap. Something about not changing the target bitmap so much made that weird bug go away. Whatever, this is at least more efficient than using a temporary bitmap.

Even with drawing directly to the framebuffer it was still unusually slow on the web version. Something about drawing all those rects, maybe some unexpected GL reading but whatever it is, doing dozens of that really killed FPS.

So I've got a callback fn for the minimap RenderTreeItem, but it still renders to a bitmap, as just rendering a single bitmap seems fine (and otherwise it would need to continue to be redrawn to the secondary bitmap when a dialog was open). But redrawing it is the problem and what kills FPS on the web. So I made the redraw for the minimap only happen when something dirties it. Even then, re-render once a second for the cursor made a noticable stutter, so I disable the blinking cursor on Web for now.

Finally got 60 FPS with no stuttering, closing.
