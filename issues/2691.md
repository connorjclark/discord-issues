my proposition: hold shift while dragging an FFC to snap it to the nearest 8x8 pixel block. Much more user friendly than having to edit the x/y values manually to be a multiple of 8/16 or carefully dragging the ffc's to be pixel accurate to the grid.

... Why has no one thought of this before

...harder to implement than I expected, mostly because placing items, stairs, blue squares, etc, all use the same function
. . . . so I added a new shift mode for THEM ALL.
(let's hope it actually works, haven't compiled yet)

YEEE it does
that was harder than expected, yes, but was still dead-simple overall (I just had particularly low expectations which turned out to be wrong)
So, you know how FFCs normally do no grid snap? They do half with shift now.
And you know how most of the other squares like this normally do half grid snap?
Those ones now do FULL grid snap with shift
and then finally, there's the poor `stairs`, which was already full grid snap, so it gets nothing new
