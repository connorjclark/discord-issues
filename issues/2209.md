By default with Force Integer Values for Scale off, the black bars on the sides of the screen go away and it stretches to fit the entire screen. But the 1x resolution is still 640x480 which is accounting for the space occupied by those black bars. So the scaling goes screwy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 04:02

Black bars appear only with force integer scaling on, and it is impossible to NOT have black bars with it on

=== @ mitchfork 03/02/2023 04:05

I think the issue is with the setting Off

(replying to @ Moosh "By default with Force Integer‚Ä¶"): You are talking about the ZC Player right? Not the editor?

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 05:31

Yeah ZC player. Editor appears to be scaled properly

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 05:33

I suspect  the issue here is just the default resolution. Should be 512x448 rather than 640x480. Unless the black space surrounding the screen region is still supposed to be present with the setting off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 05:34

I believe the extra area is needed for dialogs to fit
so, the extra black space should still be present
unless you stretch the dialog larger

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 05:40

Init data fits without, though the bottom edge of the dialog does go off the bottom. All the buttons are onscreen at least

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 03/17/2023 20:42

So in the latest nightlies, those black bars are no longer there even when Force Integer Values for Scale is ON, meaning the slight horizontal stretching is happening all the time.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 10:38

oh, uhh, try this again!
@ HeroOfFireZC @ Moosh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 10:39

because I completely redid the zc render code relating to this, as it bothered me

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 03/20/2023 17:36

Looks like it's working for Force Integer being ON now.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 18:26

Should work regardless, I hope

=== @ mitchfork 04/02/2023 19:07

My findings on this (testing in 03-31 Nightly)
with Force Integer OFF:
- the 1x, 2x, etc. resolutions are not correct.  At 1x, the play area is 555x455.  This is not an even scale of 256x224 (in a111 and previous, 1x always had a play area of 512x448 which is an even double)
- this is not the correct aspect ratio of 4:3, either
- attempting to resize manually, I cannot hit a 4:3 aspect ratio for the play area with any size window I try
with Force Integer ON:
- resizes look like they work properly here, no issues to report

=== @ mitchfork 04/02/2023 19:12

The way that this works in a112 is that while the defaults were not pixel perfect with "Force Integer Values for Scale" off, you could set your resolution properly with ZC > Video Mode.  I could for instance set the resolution to 768x672 and this would be a pixel perfect 4:3 setting.  Now that's impossible and there seems to be no way to get a 4:3 aspect ratio

=== @ mitchfork 04/02/2023 19:29

I'm aware that the point of turning the setting off is that you would be able to drag to odd resolutions where there will be pixel distortion, that doesn't bother me at all.  However:
- the aspect ratio should be 4:3 (or at least 4:3 should be possible to set)
- it should be possible to hit pixel perfect play area scaling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/02/2023 19:37

bleh
I thought I had it working undistorted??

=== @ mitchfork 04/02/2023 19:38

with force integer on, everything works properly, it's fixing to some 1.2 aspect ratio with force integer off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/02/2023 19:42

> with force integer on, everything works properly
Ahk, easy enough fix then.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 01:27

should be fixed if you can test in the upcoming nightly @ mitchfork

=== @ mitchfork 04/03/2023 02:29

I'll keep an eye out and test, thanks

=== @ mitchfork 04/03/2023 03:59

This looks good to me
