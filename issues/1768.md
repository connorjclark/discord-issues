If you set `timer->` and cycle timer to 29 (1 or 0 frames), it works as expected. However, if cycle timer is also set to 30, after the combo cycles once, if it is cycled to again, it only lasts a frame or couple and sometimes even just fails to cycle.

(Tested on two blocks switching colors every 30 frames, A switches back and forth using the timer and `->Next`/`->Prev`, and B uses `Timer->Next`, but uses combo cycling to go back)

Oh, for fucks
You know what it is @ vlamart ?
Cycling is based on combo animation
So the cycle timer keeps playing even while the combo isn't on screen
And `Reset animation when cycled to`?
That resets the combo animation when it is CYCLED to
Not when it appears by any other means
So there are probably a ton of other ways to cause this
and, it's just because of *how cycling works*
I would call this "Not a bug"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 19:46

The timer is working exactly as intended, which is nice
Cycling is just doing what cycling has always done, which is weird jank, but it's how it works

...while it may not be a bug, that doesn't mean I can't do something about it anyway. Let me see what I can do.

Ahk, couple things
1. `Reset Anim`
If checked, then after being triggered, the animation of whatever combo is at the position is reset
(So, if the combo changes, the new combo resets its' animation; which fixes the cycling weirdness)
2. `Combo Change`
I removed `->Next` and `->Prev` entirely
now it's just a textbox
old quests will populate the field based on the old flags appropriately

This COULD break scripts that used the flags via script, but, <:nekoshrug:869489800271503400> they can update

Need to add script access to ALL of the new shit, though
`combo change` has a range of `-65535` to `65535` for the record
which, `65280` is max combo
so
should be able to do whatever the hell you want with it

```
int TriggerItem;
 * The required item ID for triggering the combo.
 * If 0, no item is required.

int TriggerTimer;
 * The timer for timed combo triggers. If 0, no timed trigger will occur.
 * The combo will be triggered every 'n' frames, timer unique to each combo position.

int TriggerSFX;
 * The SFX to play when the combo is triggered. If 0, no SFX will be played.

int TriggerChange;
 * The amount the combo will change by when triggered.
 * Ex. '1' acts as '->Next', '-1' acts as '->Prev'.
 * If '0', no change occurs.```
There we go, script access
