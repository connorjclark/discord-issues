I don't know if this is an intentional change or not, but if you go into the Cheat dialog in the ZC Player, type the code, (I use "4") and press [Enter] to submit it, nothing happens.

This worked fine in Alpha 106.

Ideally, (And this may be more of a "Feature Request" than not, as this is how it used to be back in the day.)  typing in the code and pressing Enter should just activate the code and close the dialogue.  There's no need for a "Check" button or any other clicks.  

People will see what level of cheat they've activated based on what codes are available in the cheat menu. 

People use cheats as a Debug mode primarily, and all these extra clicks get annoying eventually.

So:
1. This is intentional, due to complaints about hitting enter having unexpected behaviors in most dialogs- enter will now properly affect only the highlighted object. This was a change in *every single dialog*, not just the cheat dialog.
2. There is a need for a check button and other clicks, given how cheats work now.
Once you input a code and check it, you will ***NEVER*** need to input that code or any lower code again on that save file.
It saves the fact that you have unlocked that level of cheat to your save file

Ah.  That's convenient for that save then.

and then, without re-entering a code, you can change your cheat level to any level at or below the highest level you have entered a code for.

I'm going from version to version, entering debug mode over and over again.  But that's a lot rarer, so this is indeed a more desirable change.  üëç

which includes being able to *turn it back off to level 0* if you want to not accidentally hit cheats
which is a common issue I've had before, wanting to turn it off but being unable to without save/exit
Given these factors, report will be closed as `Denied`; no bug exists.
