june 15 nightly

idk what to call this bug specifically, so feel free to change the title

you can walk onto the water combos from the dock, but you can also move *on* the raft flags as if you have the raft? this was in test mode with nothing in the inventory so idk how reliable that is, but still quite odd

i don't think it's the first screen that causes the issue, i think it happens if you walk onto a new screen and there's a raft flag where you walked to

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2023 15:12

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i don't think it's the first‚Ä¶"): ^ Yeah, that's just how the damn raft works.
No idea why
...except
it should require the raft item still?
I would think?
but yeah raft is fucking weird

=== @ P-Tux7 06/28/2023 15:14

i suppose a check could be added when entering a new screen on a raft flag to see if you have a raft and the conditions to use the raft (counters et al) because it only checks "are you entering on a raft flag" once per screen swap
though... that may be too much work for such niche payoff

=== @ tacochopper 06/28/2023 15:59

at the same time, proooooobably shouldn't be able to walk over that water tile to begin with
my guess is that's to do with the dock combo placement though?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2023 16:13

You're hitting the scroll before you drown
because it's looking at your bottom 16x8 hitbox for drowning
but scrolling uses the full 16x16 regardless

=== @ P-Tux7 06/28/2023 16:44

maybe that can be added to the tooltip for "big player hitbox"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2023 16:51

I mean, it seems fairly obvious if you've ever scrolled upwards, ever
you scroll when the top of your sprite hits it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/02/2023 00:28

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) this'll need separate Z3 handling, since it's also in `HeroClass::scrollscr`
(working on the fix in main now)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/02/2023 00:28

please add a zplay
that's the only sane process for me
playground.qst is good for one-off things like this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/02/2023 00:30

. . . . wow
there's a whole thing that looks like it handles rafting
and then
there's just a whole other section that also handles rafting
and the second one ignores if you were rafting before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/02/2023 00:31

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "please add a zplay"): I don't have much energy rn, remind me later if you end up needing it (though this is really simple; literally just scroll onto a raft flag, and currently it makes you start rafting, while after this fix, it would do so only if you are rafting into the scroll transition)
(it will be compat ruled)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/02/2023 00:56

...and fun I found a separate unreported bug while testing this fix.
both fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 14:20

@ DeletedUser test when you get the chance?

=== @ tacochopper 07/03/2023 15:06

oh hello i just saw the ping
about to go to bed but i'll test when i'm awake and home from work tomorrow üôÇ

=== @ tacochopper 07/05/2023 13:47

still able to replicate this in the july 2 nightly :/
what was the QR
oh wait lol
(the new QR was on i am silly)

=== @ tacochopper 07/05/2023 13:50

doesn't look like i can trigger the raft scrolling without the new QR ticked (good)
assume the hitbox stuff is wai / remedied by just moving the dock combo to another spot on the map

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2023 17:08

All I did is made it so it won't set you rafting if you weren't rafting before
....the ability to scroll past water like that is a bit of a harder fix, though. I fixed that for it letting you scroll past SOLIDS, at least, but with water ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è that's more difficult to fix
(that was fixed for solids a few months back, not just now, ftr)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2023 17:10

....I'm curious if a half-dock half-water combo would work (layering the dock over water with only half the green square filled?)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2023 17:11

....or, I could add a rule that makes it so you only scroll up when your HITBOX area hits the top of the screen, but, that sounds super difficult as that means the player's Y can now be -8 and still be valid, which probably would need checks in a lot of places changed
either way, the rafting interaction itself is fixed (the other issues would happen equally with normal ground that close to the top of the screen, so, not rafting related)
so closing (feel free to open a separate report if that still bothers you, will probably be marked low prio though due to difficulty)

=== @ tacochopper 07/06/2023 14:11

honestly considering how little the raft's used in the quest anyway it's easier just to move the dock around lmao
but hooray! good job emily
