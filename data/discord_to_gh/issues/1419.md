very, very minor bug. when the player respawns, the dmap's enhanced music doesn't play. however, moving to another dmap resolves this issue, and music plays as normal

haven’t tested it with midis so I’m unsure if they’re affected

I see what's wrong... bleh
I'm a dumbass
this is definitely test-mode specific.
