You can set a weapon for it to behave as (it only allows selecting bombs or super bombs, this may grow in the future)

....and, I'm inclding some in the default tileset.

=== @ P-Tux7 05/30/2023 18:36

by the by, what's the floor tiles there?
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "You can set a weapon for it t…"): ooh, brilliant!
okay so, are these the hardcoded item IDs or the item family?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/30/2023 18:37

IDs
The default quest now has `Bomb (Normal, Flower)` and `Bomb (Super, Flower)` items with separate settings

=== @ P-Tux7 05/30/2023 18:37

ah, great

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/30/2023 18:38

(notably, the normal fuse length feels ABYSMALLY short on flowers, so they have a longer fuse)

=== @ P-Tux7 05/30/2023 18:38

yeah, i was about to say if someone modifies the damage, timer, et al on the default bomb and super bomb it may fuck with the flower versions so, good thinking

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/30/2023 18:39

(also, it uses `Step->Effects` to cause the 'bomb flowers' to be lit if hit by fire or explosions)
(though that may not respect the item ID and thus might not use the right settings, in fact I think it counts as 'script created' for that)
(but, meh)

=== @ P-Tux7 05/30/2023 18:39

not an issue imo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/30/2023 18:40

yeah, you just end up with a default fuse when triggering it without lifting as a result
Also, fwiw, if you give the player the `Bomb (Normal, Flower)`, it's perfectly usable as an item- in fact it is set up to work like LA bombs, where using them automatically lifts it above your head instead of placing it on the ground.
@ P-Tux7 feel free to play with this all in ~30 mins

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "by the by, what's the floor t…"): ^

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/30/2023 18:57

? what do you mean

=== @ P-Tux7 05/30/2023 18:59

the square combos below the torch combos
red and blue

=== @ DergerSwerson 05/30/2023 19:00

cool, I like this addition. might make for some interesting conveyor puzzles too

=== @ DergerSwerson 05/30/2023 19:01

is it perhaps possible to add something that behaves as though it has no fuse?
just a generic throwable weapon
that can land and be picked up again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/30/2023 19:03

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "the square combos below the t…"): ah, those, they have speed modifiers set in the new `General` tab. One slows you, one speeds you.
(replying to @ DergerSwerson "is it perhaps possible to add…"): I mean, you could use a Remote Bomb
(bomb with 0 for fuse acts as a remote bomb)
it would just.... not trigger, ever
unless you gave the player the item, to use as a detonator

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/30/2023 19:06

Also, do note that the lweapon script of the lift glove applies to throwables
(well, actually, for bomb throwables using this new feature, those will use the bomb item's lweapon script- but normal throwables use the glove's.)
I.... need to add a flag to let scripts make weapons liftable

=== @ DergerSwerson 05/30/2023 23:41

for the sake of future proofing and just general cleanliness, can we have a throwable weapon that is simply called "Generic" that doesnt detonate at all and relies on scripting for its behaviors?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 03:20

. . .. no
I'm not generating an entire new weapon type from scratch specifically for throwing specifically for scripts
just use a script

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2023 18:12

he... is though?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2023 18:13

Nothing is stopping you from using a script to do that with normal LW_THROWN
it doesn't need its' own special weapon

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2023 18:16

ah, ok
