In official Zelda games, Link's sword charge is maintained when he scrolls to another screen. In ZC, the sword charge stops and he has to attack and start over on the next screen.
If fixed, it might be good to have some kind of backwards compatability/QR/item flag/etc for the old behavior, in case someone wanted that for some reason. (Although it kinda sucks and makes the charge way less useful)
Not sure if having slash enabled would be relevant when fixing this either, because I know you have a slightly different spin attack when you don't know slash (it moves 4 ways instead of 8, which is really cool)

yeah this is slightly bs when the spin attack or hurricane spin cost magic to use

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/28/2021 02:38

there has to be a qr, of course
otherwise old quests would be broken

The problem here is probably that the sword sprite dies during the scrolling
....that might require some interesting workarounds.

i presume it would check the charge timer like how nayru's love regenerates itself and checks the time left after scrolling
if the sword charge timer and state aren't global like the nayru's love time left timer is... eep
i guess that would need to be changed

My thing is, I don't immediately see why it would be being cleared in the first place, aside from the sword weapon being killed during scrolling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 10:16

ah no, a couple clocks are cleared in `resetflags()`
the weapon would still be a problem though I think

....surprisingly, the weapon exists on the new screen just fine
but uhh
it gets a bit stuck
wherever you scrolled
and doesn't move with you
hmmmm

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and doesn't move with you"): there was a similar issues involving setting Link's direction
I forget exactly what the cause was though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 10:47

pffft
`action` is being cleared
he's walking around with `LA_NONE`
