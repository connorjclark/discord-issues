Exporting Tile Combo Pages to Picture files onto the computer is not working. If i try to export a Tile page it does not save it to the computer. I am currently trying to export a tile set.
This is in Alpha 2.55 Latest

It will not save it to any of my folders from ZC.

Try the latest nightly, not the latest alpha. Happen there too?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 07/12/2022 08:15

Am under my covers now

But said source
Is there a reason why?

So it actually does work, but you must give a file name when saving. You can't just hit OK
there's no default file name
afaict it's always worked like this
Could change it. Would "tileset.png" be a sensible default name?

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅Exporting Tile Pages Is Not Working

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Could change it. Would "tiles…"): Given that `png` doesn't have indexed palette output ( #1728 ) I would default to `bmp`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2022 17:21

Oh good point

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 07/19/2022 06:06

Oh ok
I do give pics I save names though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/19/2022 07:06

Just made the png->bmp change and kicked off a new nightly. let me know if it's still busted for you

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 07/21/2022 00:58
