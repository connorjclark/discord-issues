They used to store the 256-colour palette, but now they don't

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2022 19:59

So they're saving as truecolor?

=== @ P-Tux7 07/10/2022 20:02

Yeah

=== @ P-Tux7 07/10/2022 20:06

oh... probably an allegro 5 thing

(having the palette data is important, so that re-importing it without clicking 'recolor' will import it with the same indexed values)

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2022 20:22

Indeed. I assume BMP still works? Since ZQuest does have multiple options for exporting images

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 20:42

cool cool, I know how to fix this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/12/2022 03:43

would this just be for BMP snapshots?

=== @ P-Tux7 07/12/2022 10:45

i know .gif and .bmp can be paletted/indexed colour
unsure about .png

I fixed bmp - that was simple. Not sure yet if the others will be possible.
