Would be nice for enemies set up to eat items could be configured to randomly select a single consumable item to take away from the player instead of every valid consumable item at once. My quest has both the magical shield and a defense ring item consumable by like likes. If the player is hit by a like like, both items are lost, which seems almost too punishing. 

If this feature already exists and is tied to the "effect strength" setting, it would be nice if there was a tooltip to clarify.

effect strength is how fast it gets eaten iirc
(or how fast the hearts/magic drain)
something problematic for this QR to consider would be to prioritize eating the highest item in each class, for example if you have two shields that are edible and you have the Keep Lower-Level Items QR checked, it would have to eat the higher-level one and not eat the lower-level one
