1. A flag that doesn't auto-hover - you have to press the jump button again while in mid-air. Might be tricky to handle with multi-jumps, sorry.
2. Multi-Use With Multi-Jumps: If checked, you get a new hover for each jump that you get (Roc's Feather multi-jump feature). If not, it only activates once no matter how many times you've jumped.
3. Auto-Hover over Pitfalls - If you have Hover Boots and walk over a pitfall, you auto-hover to stop your fall. I think Ocarina of Time worked like this? It gives similar but more useful functionality to a ladder, even without Roc's Feather. Great for 8-way quests.

So
1. This will be basically impossible thanks to multi-jump
2. This is *sort of* already a thing

If you hover until it runs out, it won't reset until you land with that checked
though, if you press Down to cancel the hover, then multi-jump, the timer will resume from where you cancelled it
3. Does this not already happen? I thought that's how I implemented pitfalls....

```down to cancel the hover```
is this a sideview thing?

err, yes

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "3. Does this not already happ…"): Oh, I looked in the GUI for both hover boots and pitfalls and didn't see anything. sorry
also that's awesome

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Oh, I looked in the GUI for b…"): aye, because it isn't a flag, it's just how pits work

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:00

yo it's even in the tooltip for hover boots class
