Link - CSet 6 - Unchangeable without lots of work and wouldn't be of much use
What CSet Rings Affect - CSet 6 - ditto
What CSet Boss Palettes Affect - CSet 12/13??? - setting it to 9 would emulate Z1, but having it change back to the level palette after you leave the boss room may be a pain.
Ganon's Stunned CSet - investigate if hardcoded or merely "The CSet after the Ganon enemy's CSet"; should be changeable via NPC data
Fiery Gleeok Head CSet: CSet 8 - should be changeable via NPC data, but potentially of low priority given that they don't flash/flicker and 8-bit mode can be used
Game Icon CSets - ESP 9-12 - of low value to change. more than 4 would be nice but also low-value.
(Auto-)Flashing Object CSets - CSets 6-9 - unchangeable without lots of work and wouldn't be of much use
(Certain game elements, such as boomerang/arrow tink and Guy fires use hardcoded CSets, but once added to #1350 their CSets will be changeable, so they are omitted.)

the main point of this thread was for stunned ganon and fiery gleeok heads, but perhaps I'm forgetting something important so I made it a whole thread

(All the unfeasible stuff is listed to acknowledge that I know about it, as omitting them might imply that I had forgotten about then)

Also allow Link dying red screen palette to be editable.

uhhh
that isn't a specific palette
it just monochromes the current palette

=== @ P-Tux7 03/03/2022 19:07

i thought it was red?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/03/2022 19:08

aye
it does a red monochrome effect
on the current palette

=== @ P-Tux7 03/03/2022 19:08

also i'm not sure if the z1 bomb flash is a cset or an effect like such

=== @ cbailey78 03/03/2022 19:10

The bomb flash does monochrome the palette for sure.

```cpp
if(!get_bit(quest_rules,qr_NOBOMBPALFLASH) && !epilepsyFlashReduction)
{
    if(!usebombpal)
    {
        if(clk==misc || clk==misc+5)
        {
        
            usebombpal=true;
            memcpy(tempbombpal, RAMpal, PAL_SIZE*sizeof(RGB));
            
            //grayscale entire screen
            if(get_bit(quest_rules,qr_FADE))
            {
                for(int32_t i=CSET(0); i < CSET(15); i++)
                {
                    int32_t g = zc_min((RAMpal[i].r*42 + RAMpal[i].g*75 + RAMpal[i].b*14) >> 7, 63);
                    g = (g >> 1) + 32;
                    RAMpal[i] = _RGB(g,g,g);
                }
                
            }
            else
            {
                // this is awkward. NES Z1 converts colors based on the global
                // NES palette. Something like RAMpal[i] = NESpal( reverse_NESpal(RAMpal[i]) & 0x30 );
                for(int32_t i=CSET(0); i < CSET(15); i++)
                {
                    RAMpal[i] = NESpal(reverse_NESpal(RAMpal[i]) & 0x30);
                }
            }
            
            refreshpal = true;
        }
    }
    
    if((clk==misc+4 || clk==misc+9) && usebombpal)
    {
        // undo grayscale
        usebombpal=false;
        memcpy(RAMpal, tempbombpal, PAL_SIZE*sizeof(RGB));
        refreshpal = true;
    }
}
```
so, with `qr_FADE` set, it does a basic greyscaling of the palette
with fade off.... it.... grabs some sort of hardcoded colors?
