bump
obviously this only applies to when it's the same music, screens/dmaps with different music should restart it of course
should probably be a QR fix

someone i know needs this for their quest's cutscenes

```this fixed the music problem but fucked the warp itself horribly
but it made the screen permanently white```

=== @ P-Tux7 12/07/2021 19:51

try it in your latest build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 14:58

uhhh
It does do a lot of white in the warp effects
but it also does that in the previous nightly
so that isn't new to this build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 15:01

....this quest was last saved in A95, so the whiteness could be any number of issues, fun

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 15:12

A98 has no issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 15:15

no issue 11/11 nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 15:17

no issue 11/19 nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 15:19

broken 11/28 nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 15:25
