Not sure how serious this is. I know re-saving in latest version is generally not expect to have zero breakages, but figured I should report this minor thing. The classic_1st.zplay first breaks on this Lvl 4 fight, for just a _single_ frame when the baddie is loaded he looks a bit messed up.

Very next frame it's fine.

wtf

(I did not do "Apply new bugfixes")
just opened, save-as

that enemy is gleeok (2 heads)
i wonder if the gleeok's tiles (neck, head, flaming head) aren't assigned properly in the old quest
or maybe this happens when loading ALL gleeoks from Old Enemy Tiles? (As found on tile page 0, "New Enemy Tiles" rule unchecked)

fwiw what the current zplay captures is also a broken frame

so this has been busted for a bit.

for the first frame `esGleeok::draw` (the head segments) `necktile` is 0 and only is set to 145 by `eGleeok::animate`  via `dummy_int[1]` on the second frame

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/27/2023 01:30

fixed by initializing these values in addenemy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/27/2023 01:32

nice catch

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/27/2023 01:39

Replay now passes when resaving 1st quest. Still might be an unexpected change going on and I just fixed a symptom, tho let's just mark this as finished.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/27/2023 01:57

ah, of course other zplays will have gleeoks that need updating. I'll let the latest push to CI continue as i'm interested in seeing the replay report

=== @ P-Tux7 05/27/2023 02:32

is this a replay-only bug? i've never noticed it before

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/27/2023 02:58

no
it's just a single frame so easy to miss
