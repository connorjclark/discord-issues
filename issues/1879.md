....huh, what the hell?
Does an 8px right margin fix it?
I could have sworn I tested this at least a dozen times

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/19/2022 00:48

It does.
If I set the R. Margin to 8

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 02:22

k, so R. Margins should default to 8 then is the issue
same as T and L

see if this fixes it
(It won't automatically change your margins when loading a quest saved after the margins were added, but, enabling the old margins QR *should* work properly now)
(and quests from prior to margins being added should now have the proper default margins)
let me know as soon as you have time to test it
(meta) thread name was changed: üíäOld string compatibility doesn't fix margins.

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/19/2022 02:42

The top margin doesn't need to be fixed.
Just the right, now the top margin is too big.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 02:44

huh, interesting. Didn't think that should have changed the top margin. Let's see what I did there...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 02:45

(also, is it wrong in both ZC and ZQ, or? @ Tabletpillow )

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/19/2022 02:46

On both

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 02:46

k

how about these?
(did that break the LEFT one?)

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/19/2022 02:51

The top margin is fixed but the right margin hasn't been increased. Left margin was and still is 8.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:05

The value in the textbox will not increase
but with the QR on it should display correctly
Is that the case?
in both zc and zq?
@ Tabletpillow

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/19/2022 03:07

I don't see a difference. The error from the video is still present.
It should be fixed if the value for the R. Margin was also changed in addition to the height and width.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:12

so with the QR enabled did not work in *either* of those 2 builds?

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/19/2022 03:16

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:29

OK

for fucks sake
this was
a fucking tangled mess
....that's ZC fixed, now for ZQ

ok thank fucking christ
that..... was a fucking clusterfuck
I don't know if someone else fucked with that in the 2 years since I swear I fucking tested it
or if I just did THAT shitty a job
but that was
some REALLY bad code

I am now dead for the night
bleh

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖOld string compatibility doesn't fix margins.
(the nightly that is about to be posted should be pretty much the build I just sent)

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/19/2022 03:35

Umm... sorry but you changed the left margin on that one not the right.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:35

?
that should fix everything
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): ^I copied your exact string settings to test
and it fixed it in both for me
What's wrong still?

the QR

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:39

what the fuck
oh, it's broken WITHOUT the QR
dammit
nice catch

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/19/2022 03:39

Yeah sorry for not being specific enough.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:39

(I did mention that it would only be specifically fixed for you WITH THE QR ON)
(...so I definitely forgot to test with it off)
Is that broken like that only in ZQ, or in both?
...I
literally can test it myself
why do I bother asking
it's both\

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:42

....it isn't that the L Margin is wrong
it's that it just *is not working at all*?

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/19/2022 03:44

Yeah I tried to change it and it doesn't work.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:44

...oh
because the fucking string field is 16-bit not 8-bit
so the new way I decided to copy the values completely broke
the LOGIC was right... just a simple mistake

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:52

fixed
not gonna post another exe, just gonna run the nightly script
