Like in Lock Blocks, but instead of unlocking a block by link pushing against it, the player pushes a button (A, B, etc.) to unlock it.  Like pushing A to break a boulder road block in Zelda 2 (AOL) after link has obtained the hammer.

I think you can already do that with chests, it's not on lock blocks?

Yeah I tried that but it didn't work for me.

This isn't needed once the glitch is fixed

I got it working now I turned off the compat rules off, however, all the locked chests are opened on the screen when I want to have multiple chests and there is not a way to make it open one chest, so I thought we could have a "Required Item" on the generic combo type.
