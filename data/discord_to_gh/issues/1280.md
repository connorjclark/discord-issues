A flag for these items that kills them if they hit a solid combo.

-Sword (beams)
-Wand (magic)
-Candle (fire)
-Byrna (beams)
-Boomerang (Itself)
-Arrows (Themselves)
-Din's Fire (fire)

In short, the same that happens if they hit the edge of the screen or are hit by an enemy that blocks them. So sword beams "explode", arrows "tink", etc.

Good for nerfing or differentiating the arrows or wand, or making higher-level items that can go through solid combos as their "upgrade". Also good for LTTP/GBC style gameplay
