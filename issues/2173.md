I have the window set to 800x600. This isn't working so well with the cheat dialog, especially the level numbers and input text in the dialog.
"Text Readability" being on or off does not affect the display of this dialog.

The dialog where you can set your equipment isn't doing so hot either, especially the item names in each class.

It also affects the various counters in the Counters, Level Items and Misc. tabs, and also some dialogue such as "Can Slash".

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "I have the window set to 800x…"): Yeah, 800x600 is not a good scale for zc
ZC's base resolution is 640x480

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/11/2023 13:46

so you are using 1.25x scale

nothing seems wrong here when viewing the window at proper scale

Fixed in latest nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 16:43

you say fixed but
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "I have the window set to 800x…"): you had zc at `800x600`?
why did you have that in the first place
that's ZQ's old large mode size
...and I didn't fix anything here, I found nothing wrong to fix
