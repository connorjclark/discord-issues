but `AST(LocationData const& location = LOC_NONE);` is declared, so it should match?
wait wtf
those errors suddenly disappeared without any changes made
msvc you're drunk
now it's only showing the linker errors on `DummyType`

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 19:45

I swear that happened before and I fixed it, but maybe I forgot to commit it.
gui/macros.h, line 126. Change `struct Dummy;` to `struct Dummy {};`
That should be all it takes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 19:47

does not fix

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 19:48

Did it change anything?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 19:48

no

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 19:48

Oh, wait, I got the wrong thing. Just a sec...

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 19:50

Okay, I think I remember that one.
gui/builder.h, line 50. Change `extern DummyType dummy;` to `static constexpr DummyType dummy={};`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 19:51

compiles
with a lot of warnings?

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 19:52

More than usual?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 19:52

a lot more than usual
lots in `size.h` for ```cpp
    template<typename T>
    static inline Size em(T t)
    {
        return Size(t*(T)emSize());
    }```
`warning C4244: 'argument': conversion from 'T' to 'int', possible loss of data`
full
```cpp
1>C:\Users\Emily\Documents\ZC\ZQSRC255\src\gui\size.h(18,22): warning C4244: 'argument': conversion from 'T' to 'int', possible loss of data

1>        ]```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 19:55

it's just that thrown like a ton of times

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 19:59

Maybe being as explicit as possible will shut it up.
`return Size(static_cast<int>(t*static_cast<T>(emSize())));`
Also, maybe it would help if I typed things correctly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 20:00

oh wait they weren't all the exact same
```cpp
    template<typename T>
    static inline constexpr Size pixels(T t) noexcept
    {
        return Size(t);
    }```
that does the same
as does ```cpp
    template<typename T>
    static inline Size largePixels(T t) noexcept
    {
        return Size::sized(t);
    }```
it's all the same warning

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:02

Figures. 
```
    template<typename T>
    static inline Size em(T t)
    {
        return Size(static_cast<int>(t*static_cast<T>(emSize())));
    }

    template<typename T>
    static inline Size largePixels(T t) noexcept
    {
        return Size::sized(static_cast<int>(t));
    }

    template<typename T>
    static inline constexpr Size pixels(T t) noexcept
    {
        return Size(static_cast<int>(t));
    }
```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 20:02

aha
yeah, just tried that myself
and works

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:02

Damn it, why is the spacing inconsistent? I swear I fixed it.
Everything sucks. üò†

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 20:02

what's inconsistent?

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:03

It's got spaces instead of tabs on some lines.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 20:03

oh
discord converts everything to spaces, which is fun

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:03

In my editor, I mean.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 20:03

should be easy enough to fix
what editor do you use?

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:03

Yeah, I just thought I had already.
Atom.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 20:04

In NP++ I can just `Ctrl+A`, `Tab`, `Shift+Tab` to retab the whole file
because on indent it converts to tabs
anyway, now time for me to shut up all these other warnings that aren't new
because that's been on the list for long damn enough

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:06

Yeah, I could probably help to clean up all the random garbage.

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:08

Well, I see why I missed the auto_ptr. G++ and Clang just accept it with warnings, and I didn't have Flex and Bison set up for MSVC.
I missed a couple of `register`s originally because Clang's the only one that considers that an error.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 20:20

if you can figure out the `'vc80.pdb' was not found` warnings, that'd be splendid, as I have no clue where to start on those

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:41

It looks like the place that should be controlled is Project > Properties, then Configuration Properties > C/C++ > Output Files > Program Database File Name.
I don't have vc80.pdb there, but maybe that's because I didn't start from an older version.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 20:42

if it's in the project properties, shouldn't that be something handled via cmake?

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:43

Dunno.
Seems like it ought to be.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 20:45

fun
`for(auto i = 1; i < listData->size(); ++i)`
apparently `auto` isn't smart enough to realize it needs to be unsigned there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 20:47

trying `auto i = unsigned(1)` to see if that works

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:48

size_t would be the proper type. May as well just specify it.

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:51

For all the stuff they've added to C++ in the last few standards, it still has stupid, antiquated type resolution rules.
I assume there's some technical reason they can't just fix it.

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 20:52

But after doing Rust for a few years, stuff like that has made coming back to C++ pretty frustrating.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 21:09

`$(IntDir)vc$(PlatformToolsetVersion).pdb` is what I have for the filename

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 21:14

ah, and the output file appears to be set to `$(OutDir)$(TargetName)$(TargetExt)`
when those apparently are supposed to match?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 21:21

ahk, not quite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 21:33

So, it appears that it's happening in the `Release` config because the `Release` config has the fucking `/DEBUG` flag?
I see no way to fix this easily for Debug, but Release should just not have the `/DEBUG` flag set

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:05


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888147408767311882/888183779577982976/unknown.png?ex=65ea3a1a&is=65d7c51a&hm=462bd3efc24bae0cb8bd4ac1c56af05f4f9855bb066cf2ad612bb87d31ca0880&)
seems to have succeeded?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:07

still throws same warnings in debug as expected
(This is set to `Build Only` warnings, no `IntelliSense` warnings, since those are... a lot)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:08

....oh fun
So, everything builds nice and good now
but I just actually ran the exes
and it appears something is crashing on quest load
zquest crashes instantly, zc on loading a save file
time for debugger.....

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:12

Well, that's lovely.
I didn't change anything in ZC, incidentally, only ZQuest.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:13

could be a c++ upgrade thing

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:13

Yeah, it'd have to be. Nothing comes to mind, though.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:13

I'd guess in qst.cpp, considering it appears to occur on loading a quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:14

. . .
it doesn't crash in debug
ffs
ok, probably the change I just made then

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:18

There was also that crash I was seeing in sprite::draw. Maybe the new VS version is doing something different with memory there.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:18

nope it isn't my recent change
fun

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:20

funny thing, since I now know that release has `/DEBUG`, I know the debugger can be attached to it
sad thing, attaching the debugger to it appears to lag my PC, ***HARD***
like, difficult to move the mouse across the screen levels of lag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:26

oh wait now it crashes in debug
good, maybe it'll debug ok now
```cpp
    if ( sprBMP2 ) 
    {
        //if there is still somehow data in the scaling bitmap
        destroy_bitmap(sprBMP2);
    }```
sprite.cpp line 1535

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:39

ahk, fixed it
I added a new function
```cpp
void sane_destroy_bitmap(BITMAP **bmp)
{
    if(*bmp)
    {
        destroy_bitmap(*bmp);
        *bmp = NULL;
    }
}```
so now, `sane_destroy_bmp(&sprBMP2);` is the call
it will properly null the var when it destroys the bitmap, and if called again on a null bitmap, will not try to re-destroy it
So, @ Saffith , what dialogs are using the new system as of now?

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:41

Cheat codes, password, and room data.

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:42

One other thing you should try: compiling and assigning scripts. I was seeing a similar issue with repeatedly deleting a temp file afterward.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:42

ooh, room data is nice

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:42

Simple enough to fix, I just didn't get to it yet.

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:44

I was also thinking of adding a conditional warning label, like "This room type requires a guy and string", but I'd have to check all the requirements first.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:47

does `Label` have alignment?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:50

(replying to @ Saffith "One other thing you should tr‚Ä¶"): no crash on this

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:50

Not yet, no. Should't be hard to add, though.
All right, that's good. I'll deal with it for Linux.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:51

With no apparent crashes remaining, compile warnings sorted (at least in release mode), and everything seeming to work nicely; I see no reason not to *actually* merge this now

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:52

Hooray! I only briefly ruined everything!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:53

ah, the wonderful feeling of closing like 20 tabs
(lots of warning/error help tabs)

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:53

Of course, as soon as you publish a build, people will find lots more  crashes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 22:53

oh of course
then it'll be a game of whack-a-mole to patch them all
but, C++17!
By the old plan, we were only going up as high as 11, and not until like 3.1/3.2
getting this in for 2.55 is *awesome*
and sane gui systems my god yes

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 22:55

The room dialog uses pretty much all the available widgets and features so far, and they're honestly not enough for much...
But with the framework in place, it should be easy to add more.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 23:02

aye
most of what I do for gui work lately has been creating new widgets
so having to do that a bit isn't that bad

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 23:07

....ummm
I really should have tested a little bit more thoroughly
because, uh, sprites now aren't drawing....

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 23:09

Eh, who needs 'em.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 23:10

unless you want to debug that now, I'll look at it after dinner
Once we iron this out I'll post a nightly build

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 23:15

Now I'm  getting a build error in ZScript_main.cpp? Nothing can ever be easy, huh.
I'm seeing sprites, though, so I probably can't help there.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 23:15

??
On `2.55-master`?

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 23:16

Oh, right. I'm still on 2.55. Just a sec...

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 23:17

Yeah, same thing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 23:18

Huh
What error?

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 23:18

`src/parser/ZScript_main.cpp:59:5: error: use of undeclared identifier '_unlink'; did you mean 'unlink'?`
Dunno. I'll check it out.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 23:19

Oh fun
It told me that `unlink` was deprecated, and to use `_unlink`

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 23:20

Well, whatever. I'm sure we can sort it out.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 23:21

Is that on linux or windows?
If linux, probably needs an ifdef
If windows, confused

=== @ Saffith 09/16/2021 23:22

Linux. So yeah, that should be sufficient.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 00:28

. . .
the sprites not drawing
doesn't happen in fucking debug
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 00:40

alright, fixed it
very confused
but fixed it

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 00:41

Do you know how?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 00:41

I just reverted my fix for the crash
and then fixed it a different way
no clue why one way works and the other doesn't, though

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 00:42

... Huh. That's always fun.
Long as it works, I guess.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 00:45

fuck I never installed winrar after factory reset
lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 00:46

pahahaha, an excuse to try out `WinGet`
(windows has a package manager now, you need to download it for the time being, but it will be being included by default in a future OS update)
(so, `winget install WinRAR` is all I need!

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 00:47

Oh, cool.
Nice thing to have.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 00:47

aye, one of the things I liked a lot when using linux for classes
