This may happen with other engine arrays, not sure - see test quest

```#include "std.zh"

ffc script test {
    void run() {
        for (int i=0; i<64; i++) {
            this->Misc[i] = 1;
        }
        Waitframe();
        for (int i=0; i<64; i++) {
            Trace(this->Misc[i]);
        }        
    }
}```
On the first screen, *writing* the values proceeds without any error, but attempting to *trace* them gives proper errors

... I was just trying out the `Hero->Misc[]` array to see if that was doing anything similar
```#include "std.zh"

ffc script test {
    void run() {
        for (int i=0; i<128; i++) {
            this->Misc[i] = 70;
            Hero->Misc[i] = 70;
        }
        Waitframe();
        for (int i=0; i<128; i++) {
            Trace(this->Misc[i]);
            Trace(Hero->Misc[i]);
        }        
    }
}```
Hero->Misc[] seems like it's working all the way up to ridiculous numbers
even though it's only documented up to 32 indices
might be completely separate bugs, I dunno
