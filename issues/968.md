"Link" -> "Player"/"the player"
"he/him/his" -> "they/them/theirs"
combo type/flag help strings are definitely one place that has a lot of text for this. Gotta scan through everything else too, try to find all instances of this. Find+Replace is unreliable, as grammar/syntax doesn't always work, so fun times.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) if you add any text moving forward, keep this in mind
Also, for things like combo help text, I'm updating the backend on how they work, so plenty of work to do beyond simply replacing text... but I have `jwin_auto_alert` set up now, which was the biggest hurdle
