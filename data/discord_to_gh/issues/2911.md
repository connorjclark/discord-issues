It would be nice to have a means of preventing an ambient sound from carrying over to an adjacent screen without doing something like using a different ambient sound to overwrite the previous one. I have a rainfall loop that's about 30 seconds long and it often carries over several screens before ending.

do empty sounds overwrite it?
though this is zelda 1 behaviour and makes sense

The problem is this quirk.
1. Screen A has ambient sound assigned to be played in loop as intended.
2. Player goes from screen A to screen B, that have no ambient sound set.
3. Ambient sound from screen A continues to play until it reaches end of loop and finishes on it`s own. Instead of stopping mid-play. As Phosphor said, this is annoying with long sound files.
