AKA allowing CSets 1, 5, 7, and 8 to editable per level palette
@ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 08:08

yeah saw!
0?
or is it just because there's a limit of 4

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2021 08:09

I wasn't sure about 0 cause I don't know what it's used for
But possibly

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 08:10

cset 0 is used for a few things in Z1
HUD bombs and inventory boxes
and the grey area in the upper left of the overworld with the graves

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 08:10

Keeping in mind this will all be on a QR, so optional

=== @ cbailey78 12/20/2021 08:10

0 is used for part of the hud and graveyard screens

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2021 08:10

Anyways, I took a look at this. This isn't as easy as I thought it'd be. The actual changing csets part? Easy. If this feature were to be "you can use the palette cycling palettes as the level specific new csets", it'd be dead simple to add

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 08:11

yes bye bye palette cycling

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2021 08:11

the problem is storing new csets, which means diving into how csets are stored, which is largely an undocumented part nobody's touched, meaning I have to learn the entire system the hard way
and I *think* I might have a grasp on how they are stored?
And I'd be willing to take the risk if it were just that, but there's the other problem

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 08:12

storing new csets eh? don't all DPals have 16 csets already?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2021 08:13

Which is the GUI work needed to edit those new csets
if @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) were willing to do her GUI magic, I could maybe try my hand at this

=== @ cbailey78 12/20/2021 08:13

The last 3 rows are reserved for gui

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 08:13

honestly what i was thinking was you know how it shows 234923492349 on the left hand side
for manual fading?
i thought it would just replace those numbers with the new per-level csets and disable manual fading if the QR was on

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2021 08:14

Manual Fading is one thing
but palette cycling also goes byebye with that

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 08:14

they'd use the same palette *slots* as manual fading and be read the same way, but be *used* for different purposes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 08:15

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "if @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) wer…"): gaaaah palette stuff is the WORST gui stuff

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2021 08:15

Manual Fading and Palette Cycling are mutually exclusive currently; you only get palette cycling if you don't have manual fading

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 08:15

like legitimately the most possible complicated fancy gui stuff

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 08:15

i don't have a much of a problem with getting rid of both in exchange for more dpal csets

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 08:15

so I'm gonna need quite a bit of motivation to get that done

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 08:16

i don't recall many palette-cycling combos in LTTP besides the thunder at the beginning of the game and ganon's flashing tower
which i can easily fake with animated combos and/or 8-bit
we have 800 something tile pages
it's like how people gave up on the BS Zelda beach palette cycling from 1.84/1.90 once 1.92 introduced animated combos
and just made it into animated combos

=== @ cbailey78 12/20/2021 08:19

We need to have RGB sliders in the palette editor.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2021 08:19

@ P-Tux7 The choice is yours. Do you want us to implement this the right way, which will be whenever Emily gets motivaiton to do the GUI stuff (because I'm not ever getting the motivation to do it myself), or do you want us to implement it sooner at the cost of it being mutually exclusive with palette cycling and manual fading, and making it more complicated to do it right later?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 08:20

(replying to @ cbailey78 "We need to have RGB sliders i…"):

You can insert an arbitrary RGB value on the left
and, if you check the `View 8b values` in the upper right, it changes to using `0-255` instead of `0-63`
(it round to the nearest multiple of 4, though, when you save it)
(because, it only *stores* 0-63)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2021 08:22

If I do it the mutually exclusive way, that would mean having another QR later if the right way ever gets done (which it might not because I imagine the motivation to do it right will be dead in the water if it's implemented in a "good enough" way), so you'd have both a "more level specific csets" QR and a "new level specific csets use expanded level palette" QR

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 08:23

=== @ cbailey78 12/20/2021 08:23

I know that, but it would be much if you could have sliders that you could drag instead of that odd color cross hair at the top. Just a thought.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 08:23

for instance, deedee's name color
ummm
That would require coding a slider
also, the color thing at the top is HSL, not RGB
(which is why it doesn't change to a color when you click it or anything, because blehg)
all gui stuff to do with palette is janky as fuck
and I personally hate it
making new palette gui stuff will be great
though I also know it will be a HUGE and PAINFUL amount of work

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 08:26

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@ P-Tux7 The ch…"): *shrug* i've never been in love with palette cycling - there's only 3 per dmap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 08:26

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) what could help, by the way, is if we found time to do some gui work *together* in a call
2 heads is better than 1, I think we'd do pretty well at some things at least

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 08:30

also, something to keep in mind about doing stuff the right way, is how many years does the current codebase even have until it's maintenance-only?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 08:31

at least a few
and it will probably be getting some updates even as the rewrite starts
the rewrite will take a *MASSIVE* amount of time, unless we get a LOT of new devs on board (which we may)
so, it's probably gonna end up starting with me making initial plans and laying out the groundwork on the rewrite, while Deedee handles the current branch mainly for a while
but, that'll be around when we put out 3.0
which is after 2.55 release
which is after 2.55 beta
which is still not feeling that close

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 08:37

Keep in mind that Alpha 1 of the rewrite will have basically just screens, camera control settings, and walking/standing sprites, plus tile/combo editing
and even that will take an absurd amount of time to build from the ground up

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/22/2021 15:30

@ P-Tux7
Merry Christmas

=== @ P-Tux7 12/22/2021 23:38

AWESOME
though one small quibble, won't this make default subscreens change?
whatever uses cset 1

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 00:40

Yes, if it uses any csets that are now level specific
Which is why with this on you have *less* colors to work with for the subscreen

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 01:33

yeah i'm wondering if it should be moved to cset 10 or 11
though luckily the lttp subscreen needs 8 colours at best

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 01:35

they used 4-colour tiles to save on cartridge space lol

so even if it stays as cset 1 instead of 10 or 11 i shouldn't have too much of an issue

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 08:25

oof, yeah
See, I'm conflicted here
cause I wanted to give an equal expansion both to "ground" palettes and to "sprite" palettes

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 08:30

ohh, that makes sense

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 08:31

But ugh, of course the subscreen hogs CSet 1
I mean it makes sense!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 08:33

subscreen has the first 2, then ground palettes, then sprite palettes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 09:01

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) did you see my PMs and fix that issue with the GUI?

=== @ P-Tux7 12/25/2021 23:20

There wouldn't be an issue with the "meta being to use CSets 10/11 for subscreens", but it admittedly does break the NES/2.10 Counters subscreen objects and the Classic tileset if CSet 1 is enabled as a per-level CSet. BS too, I think.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/26/2021 03:34

I coukd easily make it cset 10 instead

=== @ P-Tux7 12/26/2021 03:52

is there some limit gui wise that makes it batches of 4

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/26/2021 13:30

nope
I just made 4 accessible and it's a bit of a qst loading pain to add new level palettes

=== @ P-Tux7 01/17/2022 09:54

no rush but here's what i think an optimal lttp palette setup would look like
csets 0/1: subscreen stuff (meant to accomodate people who want the old subscreen counters) and possibly some objects
csets 2-5 and 7-8: per-level tiles
cset 6: link (duh)
csets 9-11: sprite objects
though 0-5 could be set entirely towards per-level tiles with 7-9 being for sprites, and 10/11 being for subscreen if i make said old subscreen counters 8-bit
