pretty much what the title says. custom class titles appear everywhere else bar the subscreen's current item properties

It's storing it in a list
and it only builds the list *once*
not again if it was already built

=== @ tacochopper 05/01/2022 13:20

.... more u know

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2022 13:20

....it needs to do it EVERY time now, because it can change while ZQ is running.

=== @ tacochopper 05/01/2022 13:21

well the reset worked at least

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2022 13:21

should be fixed for next build

=== @ tacochopper 05/01/2022 13:21
