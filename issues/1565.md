I feel like favorite commands for setting the brush width like in the right click menu would be handy for going back and forth between regular brush width and a more convenient brush width for larger sprites (e.g. toggling between 1x1 and 2x2 for regular combos and, say, trees).

err, you'd need like 20 favorite commands to cover each width/height
sorry, 27

oh er, actually yeah that would be a lot wouldn't it
I was thinking of the draw block dialog which is only like 8 options

Something like a brush panel would make sense in the rewrite
which, is gonna be entirely new main gui system
