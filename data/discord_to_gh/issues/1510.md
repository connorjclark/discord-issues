In Mystical Harps, despite the fact that the weapon is set to something lower, Link uses the highest level weapon. (Which in this case is the Trident). No script changes were made that should have caused this.

Mystical Harps has a script that disables Items when either Link or the Mermaid are in use. No changes to the script were made, which is why I think this is a ZC internal bug. Link just happens to be using the highest level sword regardless of which sword is in use. It has worked properly over many , many , versions. This anomaly in behavior is very recent.

This can be disregarded, as it simply required a very slight script reworking to fix
