Darkness light options (for Link's latern and torches/etc) that are:

- squares (probably easy)

- diamonds (rotated squares?)

- octagons (maybe hard)

- flashlights (sorta like the Z3 lantern shape, but longer forward)
(meta) thread name was changed: Light shapes - Square and (maybe) Octagon and Diamond?

octagons? the shape with eight fantastic sides and eight awesome angles?
