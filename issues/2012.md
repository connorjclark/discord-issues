If you set up an item with an option for sparkles (say Boomerang) and assign a weapon script to it, the sparkles will also inherit the weapon script. This is pretty unfriendly if you want the script to only run on the actual weapon

I noticed this with trying to make a Gale Boomerang. Enemies would get caught in the sparkles too

Fixed, with a compat rule.
