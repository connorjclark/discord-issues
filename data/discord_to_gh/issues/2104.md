Mostly functions for arrays, fixed AdjacentCombo and more.

`EmilyMisc.zh` already has one for rotating direction (as well as some other direction-related manipulations)
which, for the record, *is included in std.zh*
....the other array ones seem interesting, though I'd probably sooner add them internally than add them to std.zh
as adding them internally they would be orders of magnitude faster to run

(replying to @ Alucard648 "`//Draws sizable frame using…"): `Screen->DrawFrame()` exists, like the subscreen uses it... Though, that's a 2x2 tile using quarter-tiles, so not quite the same, but the name would probably be confusing
