The way that boomerang and hookshot grabbing items works in zc is not intuitive and is very limiting. It would make a lot of sense to just have a `Grab-able` flag for each item that determines if they can be grabbed by the boomerang and hookshot or something similar.

@ Lincolnpepper
Test if this works (new `IP_` constant, `IP_ALWAYSGRAB`, or pickup flags tab of item editor)

both setting the script constant and flags in the item editor seem to work
