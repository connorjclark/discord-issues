[nightly-2023-11-11]

If you pass `WARP_FLAG_SETCONTINUESCREEN | WARP_FLAG_SETCONTINUEDMAP` to the `flags` argument of Hero->WarpEx(), it will set the continue screen without adding that Dmap's offset to the screen ID. This happens even though it's a function that asks for a Dmap and even though the warp itself adds the Dmap's offset.

Attached is a short quest that demonstrates this behavior. Try hitting F6->Continue after these two warps. Notice how the regular Tile Warp continues on the correct screen, but WarpEx does not. You can look at the source code in the buffer to double-check that it's not user error.

(meta) thread name was changed: Hero->WarpEx() flag "WARP_FLAG_SETCONTINUESCREEN" sets continue screen without Dmap offset

I believe we can fix this w/o bothering with compat. Seem ok @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ?

looks like we just replace scrID with `currscr`, in these 4 places

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2023 04:48

seems right, yeah

> without adding that Dmap's offset to the screen ID

wait, I just used the screen the warp sent the player too
which is input screen + input dmap xoff
but this is requesting we add the xoff of the continue dmapid
...which is the same dmap nvm lol

yeah, it sets the continue to the destination, so its the same
