Apparently when the ZC player window gets big enough, the click area starts to drag and get misaligned from the cursor.

I'm using an 2K monitor, so I wanted to ZC to fill as much of the screen as it can while staying in 4:3 resolution, current window size is 1856x1392

I tested 4:3 resolution sizes, 1440x1080 works normally, but 1600x1200 and onwards from that seems to fuck up the cursor.

To add, it only seems happen with the buttons in the popup windows (like in the image posted), the dropdown menu works
Using latest build, windows 10 x64

apparently DOESN'T bug out if "Force Integer Values for Scale" is OFF

I hopefully fixed it... just by making force integer values for scale not apply to that section.
