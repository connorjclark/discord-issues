This should comply requests for various disassembled items, like Magic Container peces, Boss Key pieces (hello Twilight Princess) etc.

this.... would take quite a lot of work
boss key is an *entirely* different premise to a container
and uh
this would probably best be scripted

Written in 1 hour:
```
//Generic Disassembled item piece. Link must collect enough items to assemble whole item. 2.53.x
//1. Set aside 1 screen in a DMap, like unused space in a dungeon.
//2. Set up as many consecutive strings to track item assembly progress, like 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 etc.
//3. Create item in Item editor, assign script into Pickup script slot.
// D0 - Item to assemble.
// D1 - Number of pieces to form whole item.
// D2 - First string of the sequence from step 2.
// D3 - Dmap from step 1, needed to track item assembly progress.
// D4 - Dmap Screen from step 1, needed to track item assembly progress.
// D5 - Dmap Screen D register from step 1, needed to track item assembly progress.

item script ItemPiece{
    void run (int Item, int Numpieces, int string, int DMapD, int ScreenD, int ScreenDReg){
        int D = Game->GetDMapScreenD(DMapD, ScreenD, ScreenDReg);
        if (string>0) Screen->Message(string+D);
        D++;
        if (D >= Numpieces){
            item coll = Screen->CreateItem(Item);
            coll->X = Link->X;
            coll->Y = Link->Y;
            D = 0;
        }
        Game->SetDMapScreenD(DMapD, ScreenD, ScreenDReg, D);
    }
}```

does this handle the subscreen?

=== @ Alucard648 08/29/2021 02:14

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "does this handle the subscree…"): Unfortunately, unless you script subscreen entirely, this not handle. And as for current version docs, subscreen scripts are not implemented.

yeah that's been an issue with like
2.50 magic container pieces
