Alpha 99 current
link doesnt grab the ladder while coming into room 80 for secret item
link just falls down to the floor, like a cliff jump
default gravity, sideview gravity on

this rule required or link can't traverse down the ladder at all

without rule it forces you upwards to the previous screen

wtf

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/28/2021 02:54

oh, I see the context
just needs to put a "grab ladder" whenever you enter a sideview screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/28/2021 04:08

I thought that existed
also why does it walk off the top of the screen if it isn't new hero movement?
is it doing the stepforward code to step forward by 2 tiles?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/28/2021 05:07

I presume so
Which is weird
I need to look into it

=== @ tim 11/28/2021 05:17

its doing the dungeon step
up cause it thinks its collision below
