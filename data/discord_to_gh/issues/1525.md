Stomping two enemies at once hurts the player. I presume that this is because of the stomp weapon being "used up" on one of the enemies. Perhaps a QR should be made to let the weapon unconditionally exist for a frame or two when landing instead of dying upon collision with an enemy? Granted, I'm not sure how this would interact with enemies that "block" (and presumably kill) the stomp weapon, but it's at least better.
