A new file type, which will be saved every time you save a .qst (saved with the same name, different extension, similar to key files)
It will be loaded every time you load the .qst, but is *not* required to load the quest
This will hold extraneous info, such as customized itemclass names, and customized itemclass help text; which were previously part of Modules.

Example. (The zinfo file type will take up as little space as possible. That 2KB? It's storing 1024+512 bytes of 0s, and then header data
that's a 0 (byte) for each itemclass name
and a 0 (word, so 2 bytes) for each help string
the 0 representing the length of the string
so, as 0, means `don't store anything at all`
If you were to customize a name to `"FooBar ItemClass"`, the `0` for that slot would become a `16`, followed by 16 bytes containing the 16 characters of that string.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2021 00:32

so, it will take more memory based on how much you customize.
Using 0 memory for a name will use the default data.

Hype!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2021 00:39

And if the file is missing, it will just use all default data
Right now ZC would only need it for the cheat menu itemclass names
but you probably want to provide it with your quests in general, if you use anything non-default

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2021 00:42

....technically this should work now, just, there are no editors for the variables. Need to make dialogs to edit itemclasses now.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2021 00:43

which may not be for right now
might need sleep first

=== @ P-Tux7 12/24/2021 04:44

i'd appreciate some sort of readme in the zinfo that you can include for like tilesets

=== @ Moosh 12/24/2021 04:48

Isn't that what the help text field is for?

=== @ P-Tux7 12/24/2021 04:48

isn't that just for itemclasses right now
i mean like an entire tileset readme

=== @ Moosh 12/24/2021 04:49

Why would you need a .zinfo to do that? Instead of just packaging a txt with the tileset

=== @ P-Tux7 12/24/2021 04:50

you technically don't need this either but it's convenient to have it in the same window as zquest

=== @ Moosh 12/24/2021 04:51

I guess
Personally I've never once used the ZC->Help menu because I find opening the text files directly to be overall better
ZC's ui cannot handle scrolling through plaintext gracefully

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2021 07:58

You can include custom helptext for each class
which can be viewed using the `?` button next to itemclass in the item editor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2021 08:02

As an example

`Custom Itemclass 1`, now default `zz067`, info'd as `Trading Sequence Items`
If I click OK and re-open the dialog

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923733363783761941/923848263386406942/unknown.png?ex=65eac63e&is=65d8513e&hm=7f4faad1bdc0ac6e89461c44fe96db0b4c7385fc550de01659986c2700e6e8a6&)
it refreshes the name
and if I go to the item editor

So, you want to customize the names of all of the `zz???` itemclasses, and give them custom help text to represent their purpose you have given them?
You can do just that
and you gain an ~2KB extra file to lug around with the .qst as the cost

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2021 08:07

If ZC finds the `.zinfo` file present, it will load the item name data:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923733363783761941/923849274486292490/unknown.png?ex=65eac72f&is=65d8522f&hm=27e3c9b3e3710409caa1453b3ccab2b83ee30c5b87db872329a8e9307c78330b&)
cheat menu will display appropriately
If `.zinfo` is not found, quest will load with default info displaying for item class names\
Same goes for ZQ
a missing zinfo file is non-terminal, it will just auto reset the info to defaults
and you can just continue editing the quest
You could create multiple zinfos, and swap out the files

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2021 08:11

or have a shared project where everyone has their own info files, if you wanted to
but importantly, you can store a lot of data in that file without necessarily bloating the `.qst` size
If you wanna try, you can try this out
