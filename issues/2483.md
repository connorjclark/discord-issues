=== @ Deathrider 06/30/2023 03:23

I have an npc script with the same name as a namespace and ZQ freezes at Registration

=== @ Deathrider 06/30/2023 05:34

This was discovered with @ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 06/30/2023 05:35

Very confused because I tried the exact steps Deathrider was getting the hang on and there was no hang

=== @ Moosh 06/30/2023 05:38

Oh yeah, what build are you on Deathrider?
Recalling that you also were able to have a class and NPC script with the same name and that just sounds not right

This is what I get

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/30/2023 16:50

which, the error message isn't worded quite right, but the behavior is what I expected

=== @ Deathrider 06/30/2023 21:24

I can send the build tonight

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/30/2023 21:43

If it isn't happening on latest, the answer is "update because it's already fixed"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 04:32

Also, err, it didn't *freeze*
the external parser *CRASHED* on you
and your build was `nightly-2023-06-15`
(there's a crash report)
If this hasn't been magically fixed in the last 2 weeks, then, there's something more to this bug than what you've said, and it will need more info/testing- please update to lastest nightly and test when you can.

=== @ Deathrider 07/01/2023 06:00

I was not able to replicate the issue in the latest build

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 08:06

> Also, err, it didn't freeze

How does ZQuest respond to ZScript crashing? Locks the UI?

=== @ Deathrider 07/01/2023 15:55

When it happened to me I had to task manager zq

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 16:48

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "> Also, err, it didn't freeze…"): yeah, so ZQ froze because ZScript crashed
Tried to work on a way to fix that before, it did NOT work well and caused many more problems
if you have a way to fix that connor, that would be beautiful

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 16:48

It's stuck in a loop trying to read from the dead pipe or something?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 16:48

yep
I tried using a thread that could interrupt and such, but it just got REALLY nasty and crashy

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 16:49

I think I've seen the same with test mode but that doesn't used the piped interface fwiw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 16:49

Test mode launches ZC, but then does not have any "holding" calls to the other process

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 16:50

Maybe it was browser version idk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 16:50

Compile launches the parser, and then *has to completely hold until it's done*
because, in fact
the console window that outputs the stages of compiling?
That's part of *ZQUEST*, not the parser
so ZQ is running loop, continually reading from pipe from the parser, and spitting information out to the console popup
or, with some config on
it doesn't do a popup at all
and instead uses the ZQ box_out interface to display the output

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:12

Is there a way to force a program to run something on exit regardless of crash state? Because, if so, we could just have the parser send the token to close the connection on exiting, which should allow ZQ to detect the crash and even report a crash error...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 23:13

No, if something crashes a process, unless you own the hardware (you don't - the OS does) you can't do anything reliably.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:14

damn

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 23:14

That's why crash reporting uses _out of process_ code to do the reporting.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:14

The problem is ZQ is stuck in a *windows side* holding call for the pipe

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 23:14

Anyway, I'd expect we should be able to know when the process we spawned is dead.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:14

aye, if ZQ could be running at all

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 23:14

Or the pipe. or whatever. This stuff is queryable
what line?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:15

The pipe is through a file, for the record
not direct to the process
(through file is FAR faster and was a performance improvement)
most of the zq side of this is in `dialog/compilezscript.cpp`
or at least referenced from there

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 23:17

So what line is reading the content from this file? Maybe there is a timeout/non-blocking version of reading from the pipe (read: file) we can use, and in between polling we check if that process we spawned is still around.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:18

looks like the actual reading is in `base/process_management.cpp`
it launches from line 83, `launch_piped_process`....
ah, but that doesn't have all the class functions for the `process_manager` class....
oh,
that's because they are in the matching `.h` directly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:20

...looks like it similarly has a `ReadFileEx` for async operations
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 23:23

Changing this to async / using callbacks and polling is kind of a lot of work. Maybe better to use a timeout? https://stackoverflow.com/a/35303690/2788187

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:24

so, it could time out and then retry, but, it could check if the parser process is dead between to completely abort?
sounds sane
....not sure how to check the process being alive offhand though
but, we have the `PROCESS_INFORMATION`
so probably can get it from that somehow
or just the pid, which is stored in the `process_killer` struct inside the `process_manager` struct
and we have the `void* process_handle`
because, as in the name, the `process_killer` is designed to allow ZQ to terminate the launched process
as used with the console windows themselves

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/03/2023 23:31

We have a process_handle, which can be given to `WaitForSingleObject` with timeout=0 to check if it is still alive. If the call has a timeout error code, it's alive. Can add a new method to our process_handler for `is_alive`.

for unix you send a "blank signal": https://stackoverflow.com/a/70047806/2788187
If you do this work in a branch, I can verify it on mac/linux.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:36

I certainly do not have the brain for this at the moment

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 23:37

I've made a new bug report tag `🔓DevDiscussion` to note threads like this, where they can be marked as closed or etc for the bug report while still noting that there's an open dev discussion on the topic- makes it easier to not have discussion like this be buried, or require keeping the report marked open when the main reported issue is resolved.
either you can do this, or I'll get around to it at some point when I have the energy to brain

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2023 02:29

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Changing this to async / usin…"): this appears not to work at all
...only applies for serial comm ports? so not pipes?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2023 05:08

oof, done with this for tonight.
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) I got something mostly working with `ReadFileEx`
but while sometimes it executes asynchronously, running my loop checking for timeout, it seems to be completely stalling sometimes without asyncing....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2023 05:20

I pushed to a branch what I have so far
`zscriptcrashdetect`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/18/2023 23:40

here's the error it seems

FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED needs to be present somewhere?

I've got it in a busy loop waiting infinitely

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 00:48

it's printing... but it's not getting the error code for the process being dead that I expected it to get from `GetOverlappedResultEx` (i.e. it is not getting a `WAIT_TIMEOUT` return, only `WAIT_IO_COMPLETION` (the standard 'not done yet' signal)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:01

OK
I have it throwing an exception when it detects the parser is dead
....having trouble CATCHING the exception where I want to, though? Program just crashes, instead of reaching the catch....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:27

HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Because I was stupid and had a typo
easy finish to a complex series of problems

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:41

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) I have it like, kinda partly set up for non-windows? Most of the stuff exists, I just don't know (or care to try without a testing env) how to set up the linux-specific stuff relating to the timeout

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1124178254417375404/1131038386732400710/image.png?ex=65e7ca15&is=65d55515&hm=bb183d1f08158a2cbb6f307091a53cd4359d33090d68a43c18173628289ce426&)
should just need to throw the `zc_io_exception::dead()` if the process dies
(`zc_io_exception::timeout()` also works)
(...probably did not need to get as semantic as I did about the exception stuff.)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/19/2023 01:49

I'm about to be AFK for like a week, but before that I have just enough time to get this cool flatpak out working for some linux users - but not enough time to check the timeout thing you mentioned doesn't bork everything for linux users. Can you wait for a week before merging?
Otherwise, you can do what I do: just get VirtualBox w/ Ubuntu 22

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:51

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I'm about to be AFK for like…"): well, the only change that should currently be in for linux is the exception class existing, and the try/catch and error messages existing, along with those two exception throws there I had put because they seem correct. I can just comment those out before pushing so linux will be basically unchanged?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/19/2023 01:52

(Actually I just need a nightly out in a bit, then ya can do whatever)
Just waiting for some stuff in my CI to pass, then I'll merge upstream and do a nightly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 02:10

For the record, for windows, this was INCREDIBLY FUCKING COMPLICATED
I had to change the entire pipe system to named pipes instead of anonymous pipes
which then works better with ReadFileEx/WriteFileEx
and is from what I can tell necessary for any form of timeout to work

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/19/2023 02:14

I wonder if we could write to a "memory file" instead, so we keep the speed but get the ease of just using file I/O APIs 

https://stackoverflow.com/a/61691410/2788187

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 02:20

So the funny thing
we are doing a standard file for most of the io
it uses the pipe to send a single 4-byte code which is used for some information, and then any console output is read from the file
(with the code telling it if the output should be colored as text, error, warning, or debug, plus a code for "done compiling" IIRC)
I have no idea how or why it works that way, that was all @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)'s optimizations.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/19/2023 02:36

it's certainly not worth changing at this point
if you've already got it working better
maybe...next time we have to totally fuck with the pipes we consider "is it worth it"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/19/2023 02:46

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I have no idea how or why it…"): I think I reduced it to the smallest amount of data that needs to go through the pipe because piped data is slower than just writing to a file and telling the other program to read it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/19/2023 02:47

before it had to pipe all the zasm through the pipe and the pipe can only pipe so much at a time, so compiling larger scripts ended up taking ages.
iirc there's some bugs with the code it sends like it sometimes playing the wrong sound...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:02

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) will need you to take a look at this branch, it's failing compile on ubuntu with linker errors soooo really unsure what to do there. (Mac and Web are both passing fine...)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 03:15

did you see

```
/usr/bin/ld: zsys.cpp:(.text.startup+0x16): undefined reference to `CConsoleLogger::~CConsoleLogger()'
```

https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/actions/runs/5605767564/jobs/10255254207#step:22:12689

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:18

yeah
but like
?????
I have no idea why or what that means here
and it compiles on windows, mac, and web 100% fine
I have legitimately no idea how to debug this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 03:22

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Otherwise, you can do what I…"): sure you do
weird error
you only deleted code in zys.cpp right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:24

yeah, I moved it elsewhere because it was causing issues
there were a couple things that used `jwin.cpp` stuff there
which I just moved to `jwin.cpp`
because, `zscript.exe` wants to use `zsys.cpp`, but does not have `jwin.cpp`
(this being something that has caused many errors for months when trying to play with parser stuff)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 03:25

also changed `#include "base/process_management.h"` which is the only thing that could be impacting this compile unit zsys.cpp
maybe try putting `#include "base/process_management.h"` (which is in zdefs.h) just where it is needed?
ie. not included everywhere

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:27

...fair. Why is that in zdefs anyway?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 03:27

I can't articulate it but with random linker errors like this where you didn't really seem to _change_ anything, the culprit could be a latent bug introduced by cyclical includes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:27

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I can't articulate it but wit…"): exactly my problem lol
when I get `error on line x something fucked up` I know where to start

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 03:27

so one solution: make the gordian knot of zdefs.h slightly less knotty

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:28

linker errors drive me crazy
...yeah, tbh, slowly removing zdefs.h into separate files seems sane

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:35

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...fair. Why is that in zdefs…"): ....apparently for `launcher_dialog.cpp` and nothing else. Wow.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:54

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "maybe try putting `#include "…"): didn't fix anything

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 03:58

What cmake target does ConsoleLogger compile in

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 04:01

. . . that would normally be in `/modules/` but there's 0 results found
oh wait
```cpp
add_library(zconsolelogger STATIC src/zconsole/ConsoleLogger.cpp)
target_link_libraries(zconsolelogger PUBLIC allegro_with_legacy zcbase)```

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1124178254417375404/1131435964984741968/image.png?ex=65e93c5b&is=65d6c75b&hm=f04a0ce8d667be63f470ab9e7f1fb028f93e0294aa54bc7fad5ace36abd600f1&)
...so, everything? `zelda`,`zquest`,`zscript`,`zlauncher`,`zconsole`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 04:03

That's fine then

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 04:05

Id start moving some code out of the header files like process management.h and into .cpp
Along with any includes only needed by implementation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 04:06

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Id start moving some code out…"): I literally did this with process_management.h
that was one of the changes I made lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/23/2023 14:24

sooo you know
it probably would help
if the parser targetted the `zcbase` library

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/23/2023 14:26

(in cleaning up zdefs, the same errors were occurring on main- adding that targetting fixed it)
waiting for ci on this branch now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/23/2023 15:07

woo, merged.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/23/2023 15:09

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) I have…"): ^ @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) whenever you have the time to handle this for non-windows (no rush whatsoever)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 07:25

What's a way to test this? What can we do in parser.cpp to simulate the hanging-behavior that this code should prevent ZQ freezing under? We could do that if a certain environment variable is set, such that this could become our test in CI:

```sh
timeout 20 ZC_HANG_ZSCRIPT=1 zquest -quick-assign blah.qst
```

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 07:28

What you have commented out for linux looks fine to me.
Though, there's that pesky issue of pids being recyclable...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 07:30

oh, wait: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32511448/2788187
since this is a child process we must use `wait`
ex: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20240710/2788187

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/27/2023 07:32

I guess this is how a parent process can be sure that no one has scooped up the pid they were using for their childs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 18:51

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "What's a way to test this? Wh…"): I just tried compiling a script containing ```
repeat(214748)
repeat(214748)
repeat(214748)Trace(1);```, and then I task-killed it after a moment (you want to task kill it quick lol before it eats all your system resources)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 18:52

....you could probably also just supply the `-delay` arg, which can be done by holding `Ctrl` while clicking `Compile` if dev mode is enabled (dev mode is enabled via either debug build, or adding  the config `pwd = amongus` under the `[dev]` header in `zquest.cfg`
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I just tried compiling a scri…"): for the record, what this does, is the same thing as typing `Trace(1);`.... 214748^3 times in a row. Not gonna ever finish lmao.
but, the hard task kill is what simulates the actual *crash*
...there is nothing here to prevent a parser HANG from being a problem, but if it hangs you can always taskkill it, which then would trigger this.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 21:18

just call abort
Or is it just in hang not crash

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 21:19

hang is a problem, but, the user can task kill it
which then acts like a crash instead of a hang, which this fixes
(i.e. we never time out if the parser process is still alive, only if it died already)
(which, larger scripts could take absurd amounts of time while still being valid scripts, so such a timeout could inadvertantly cause valid scripts to error for being too complex, so I don't see a good way around that)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 21:20

Is there a reason your delay thing couldnt just call sleep for 100s or whatever

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 21:21

It gets stuck there almost infinitely, which allows attaching the process, and then I just use the debugger to skip those lines after
...could I forcibly break it out of the inside of a sleep function without issues?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 21:23

(I literally just drag the yellow arrow for "next running statement" down outside the loop)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 21:23

I'm not following
Oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 21:24

if I did `sleep()` for 100s, could I immediately skip the remainder of the wait using the debugger as soon as I attach it?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 21:24

Well, the loop could sleep for a second at a time for a while
