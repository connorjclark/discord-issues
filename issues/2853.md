In the player, as of alpha 120, you can’t bind shift or control to buttons anymore. The prompt to press a key simply doesn’t advance. Trying to get around it by manually editing the cfg file doesn’t seem to have an effect on the controls at all, so can’t get around the issue that way either.

What version did this work?

The last build I used before 120 was from august. It was working there. I can’t be any more specific than that, but other people brought it up with 120 so I suspect it’s quite recent
