This would make it possible to have three treasure chests of any requirement on the screen. Multiple chests on one screen is very common in the official Zelda games and this addition would not only make quests feel more authentic to Zelda, but encourage users to play around more with the new more authentic chest options already added, such as costs, button prompts, and Hookshottability. I can also see some fun potential with the three Chest Copycat combos now that it would be easier to trigger all three different kinds on one screen.

New combo attribute: Flag used
Normal
Locked
Boss Locked

New combo attribute: Item inside
0: Special Item
1-128: Specific Item ID -1
-1 - -8: ScreenD 0 to 7 read as Specific Item ID

This also would result in the Screen State Carryover menu having the names changed to Chest 1, Chest 2, and Chest 3, and the Locked Chest and Boss Locked Chest combos' names being changed to indicate their deprecated necessity.

The problem here is, grabbing the item from one chest would make the item not be in the other chests
since that uses the screen's special item state
so once you grab one, the other chests become empty
unless screen states were expanded to handle this better, but, that's a quest size / memory eater to expand, so not likely to happen
