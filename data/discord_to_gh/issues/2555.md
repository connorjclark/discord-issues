7/27 Nightly, reported to occur since at least alpha 115. https://discord.com/channels/129399825342005250/714936151877746689/1134715597826035812 (PureZC Server) 

Confirmed. File->New, setting up a walkthrough door, and bombable door. Ruleset "Modern", with "Bugfix" and "Zscript bugfix" rule templates. 

For the walkthrough: walk into it and jump. Continue walking into door while in the air. You will get sucked in and softlock. 

For the bombable: Bomb the door, then jump into the opening. You will get sucked in and get softlocked with a very slightly different sequence of events.

(the setup is a 2x2 block of screens. left column is walkthrough, right column is bomb. feather and bombs in inventory already)

...is it `HeroClass::stepforward()` running while in the air? And why would this be broken now but not for literally always?

=== @ Majora 07/29/2023 09:06

maybe the QR for blocking screen crossing while in the air, too?
I assume that gets cchecked with the Modern ruleset

=== @ Majora 07/29/2023 09:08

ah, it is checked

^ This is 2.50.2
it sucks you across in mid-air if you try to jump through a door
you stay at the same height
and then continue the jump after you stop auto-walking
. . . cursed shit.
(replying to @ Majora "maybe the QR for blocking scr…"): This would be a good possibility for what would cause further issues

(replying to @ Majora "maybe the QR for blocking scr…"): ....just toggling that rule on causes THIS

which, seems to be what you are reporting

=== @ Majora 07/29/2023 18:41

is that 2.50.2 still
and yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 18:42

2.50.2 didn't have that rule to toggle lol
so, yeah, this is just this rule being not good with the autowalking
I'm gonna adjust this rule to also prevent entering NES dungeon doors while in the air
seems sanest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 18:46

EZ

just had to add the `if` condition around this section
(If you jump into the wall like that, you now will scroll the instant you land, assuming you are still holding the direction)

=== @ Majora 07/29/2023 18:47

woo, simple fix
