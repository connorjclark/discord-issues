I tried it on the default new quest and on a quest I'm working on, and when I pressed "Grab", then "File", ZQuest outright crashed.  Ugh.

=== @ NightmareJames 04/17/2023 16:33

Crashes on James Quest Sidestory as well.  3 different quests crash

=== @ NightmareJames 04/17/2023 21:33

Oh, OK

=== @ Orithan 04/18/2023 02:03

Ran into this issue too

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) What was the purpose of this? It seems like previously `fext` could be null, and with your changes in those cases it nullpo's and crashes.

Purpose was that ext was a const char being assigned to a char which msvc cpp 20 doesn't allow anymore

Guess the string copying is wrong I haven't looked closely yet

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/18/2023 18:16

simply appears that it can sometimes be NULL, and you didn't account for that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/19/2023 02:56

fixed

=== @ NightmareJames 04/19/2023 23:39

There's still bugs related to this.  Will post when I get time to document them in full

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2023 23:40

Bugs related to file picker extensions causing a crash?

=== @ NightmareJames 04/19/2023 23:41

Crashes and other related bugs, yes

=== @ NightmareJames 04/19/2023 23:42

Emily, general3 voice chat.  Going to show you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2023 23:42

Not available

=== @ NightmareJames 04/19/2023 23:44

First of all, I get this screen.  As JQS is still unpassworded at the moment, this shuould not happen

Then second, after I force my way in and import the tiles, click "Done", it crashes anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2023 23:45

K, this seems to relate to the tile grabber and quest loading
Which is entirely unrelated to the file selector dialogue

=== @ NightmareJames 04/19/2023 23:46

New report?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2023 23:46

And as such has nothing to do with this thread, and needs a separate report

=== @ NightmareJames 04/19/2023 23:46

OK
