Last time I messed with this garbage I made a rather unreasonable request but looking at it again I notice something simple I don't think I pointed out before. Every time you use the organize menu, it defaults the source and dest to 0 and 0. For dest there's not much can be done, the editor isn't a mind reader. But for the source in nearly every instance you'd want to use this menu, it's just the currently selected alias. Like I dunno why source is even a field, it makes you do this one alias at a time and type in the ID every time. ü§¶

It's true.  This would be Christmas in a can right here. 

Heck, even a button that would fill the Destination field with the next Alias would be fun,  or a button to fill the one four slots down for a vertical destination.

fills both in with the current value
