Can the lantern item class receive a checkbox that says "is not active outside of dark rooms"

I have one set up with a timer based use cost on a custom counter, but the counter still drains outside of a dark room.

Alternatively you can disable the item in dmap ...does that prevent the counter decreasing?
Idk if it also just like removes it entirely from inventory not sure how it works

o yeah I guess I need to experiment with that. which I will when ZC stops crashing like that ü•≤

Hmm, it shouldn't drain outside of dark rooms tbh, that's an oversight

@ Majora firstly this is a bug report not a feature request, secondly this does not occur for me, and might be a z3 issue?
