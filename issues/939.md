It would be neat to have an eweapon bomb that behaved like Link's bomb, sitting in place and then exploding after a few moments. This is basically the Sluggula bombs from A Link to the Past (in Misery Mire). 

But I know there's a lot of dev stuff to do and not sure how hard adding new eweapon types/behaviors is, so no worries.

It would be interesting to see more enemies use player like weapons.

Weapon types aren't that bad afaik
could be worthwhile
