As title says. Can send quest and script files if necessary.

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) any crash reports?

=== @ DergerSwerson 09/10/2022 17:20

i was able to get the compiler to crash outright by importing Mitsukara's 6th quest script, so its not just Mystical Harps that is causing compiler crashes. There could be any number of reasons why it crashed, so i dont know how relevant this is, but it seems the compiler isnt liking large scripts that much

Still having the bug. both with Mystical Harps script and with Mitsukara's 6th Through the Inverse Glass script on a fresh quest. the second doesnt even hit assign, just crashes instantly

Different place than the last one completely
so I do think my fix may have fixed *A* problem

yes this is new

cannot repro w/ this change
do you recall what gui glitch was fixed by putting it in the other order?
(moving acquire_screen up a line)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 02:22

I... don't recall why that occurred
what commit was that in?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 02:24

it looks like I just added the acquire screen call there
for the draw command
putting it around the start command as well makes sense I guess? I think I just didn't think it was needed for any reason

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/15/2022 02:25

gotcha. quick check and thing seem the be drawing fine with this change
I assume all dialog messages need to have the screen acquired b/c they might touch the screen bitmap
I'll push this fix

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/15/2022 02:27

@ DergerSwerson give it another shot in the next nightly, should be fixed.

=== @ DergerSwerson 09/15/2022 03:57

still crashing after assign. i have good news though, that the crash doesnt happen on the x86 version. will be using that instead

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/15/2022 04:05

üò≠

=== @ DergerSwerson 09/15/2022 04:11

oh, my bad
it does still crash on the x86
