I think it's kinda cumbersome to have them both as a separate option and I got a strong somewhat visual idea on how to consolidate them. Gimme a few seconds and I'll send a mockup image soon.

(meta) thread name was changed: Consolidating Tile and Side Warp into one menu.

Allow me to explain my mockup. Tile and Side Warps would be both under their own master-tabs, with a, b, c and d being sub-tabs. The T.Flags and S.Flags would be for handling certain options which for now just includes Combo Carry Over but other things may come later. The screen number thing you'll notice has two instead of one thing and it has an equals sign right? yeah, you input the destination number and the second box will autofill the actual screen number while you're typing which would reduce the amount of trial and error when setting up screen warps in dungeon screens because the actual screen number is shown in the second box, for overworld maps it ideally should be identical to the number you actually input. I believe having the warp returns as check boxes is less tedious and would be a better design choice for the GUI

So any thoughts on the mockup I just finished?

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 23:07

and right now this is what the Tile and Side flags menu would look like. There may come the need to add more options later

Just now noticed the map was missing from my mockup

This could be messy, sounds like a good idea on paper, but feels like it could be more messy.  @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 23:28

I'd probably just make them be 2 tabs in the same dialog

=== @ NightmareJames 10/02/2021 23:28

Agreed

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 23:32

and what about my suggestion on a second box that autofills with the actual destination number when you type in your offsetted destintation number in the screen warp box. I came up with that specifically to deal with a frustrating thing where when warping from OW to dungeon maps you end up sometimes getting the destination number wrong due to dungeon map offsetting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 23:32

Aye, that would make sense

=== @ NightmareJames 10/02/2021 23:32

That sounds like a good suggestion

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 23:32

The second box is supposed to autofill with the actual destination number

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 23:32

Will look at this more when I have time

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 23:32

aye

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2023 19:47

@ Moosh eventually? (low priority)
oh wait this is an old thread lol
@ FireSeraphim you should remake this thread

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/22/2023 19:48

Aye, but where?
