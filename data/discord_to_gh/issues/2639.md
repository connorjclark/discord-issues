I suspect the dev feature was left on mistakenly.

. . . we haven't used that dev feature in forever
because we have a new better one
that doesn't have that problem

Ah this was my bad. Fixed.
I resorted to this bc it is not written anywhere _what_ the magic password value should be in the config. Can it just be a boolean...
Or written somewhere in the `./docs/`
