Dying while the system is paused through F3 and using F4 to frame advance hangs ZC.
You cannot use F3 to unpause the program or F4 to continue to frame advance. F6 is shut down during this time as usual. This results in the program being hung and needing to F9 or F10 to reset or quit.

Example of this in action

ffs

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 02:39

Also the Current Life counter does not draw during the death animation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:41

Is that an engine subscreen object?

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 02:56

Yes
Counter, Curret Life

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:58

Check if that object draws during death animation in 2.50.2/2.53 if you can?
I don't feel like that would have changed

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 02:59

That object was not present in 2.53

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:59

Oh?
It's new??
Who the fuck added new engine subscreen stuff

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 02:59

Life, Magic, Max Life and Max Magic were added as selectable counters for the counter object after 2.53

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 03:00

Why weren't they selectable before??
Gaaah zc why everything
Screenshots of the subscreen editor tabs for that object?

Okay resolved the life counter disappearing on 0 thing
Had to tick "Show Zero"
Which is pretty confusing tbh given the other things that display 0s

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 04:01

Yeah, if it doesn't show 0, then it just shows nothing when the counter is empty

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:56

(replying to @ Orithan "Dying while the system is pau…"): need a quest that this occurs in

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 06:57

Unable to reproduce this in a fresh file?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:57

correct

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 06:58

Because I don't know what in the world does this in the two quest files I've had it in.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:58

Do you have a `hero onDeath` script assigned?

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 06:59

Only in the case of Ryuu. Soul Hunter, the quest I posted the screenshot from, doesn't
Unless... that script is empty
I typically assign all the globals with empty files when I start a project and fill them where needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:59

and, `ZScript->Quest Script Settings->Hero OnDeath Script runs AFTER engine death animation`?

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 06:59

No. Not this rule

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 07:03

aha
only happens with that rule off and an ondeath script assigned
and that rule defaults to on in fresh quests

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 07:04

I run with that rule off because I want to play my own death animation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 07:06

*OH*
So, it sets `Playing = false` to disable F6
but that also disables F3/F4
and normally that's fine
because the engine death animation forcibly undoes F3 mode
but the onDeath script does NOT do that
it needs to
