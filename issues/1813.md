When testing a light puzzle and resetting ZC, the previous light beams are still drawn a few frames after the test is restarted, even on a different screen. The beams also seem to delay being drawn about the same amount of frames when the screen scrolls. Meaning if a trigger relies on light beams, it gets retriggered when entering that screen before it finishes loading

I think a video might be needed

What do you use for screen recording?

OBS

(replying to @ vlamart "When testing a light puzzle a…"): yeah, I noticed this myself, drawing at least
I wouldn't have expected it to be anything more than visual, though?

...I don't see it delaying AT ALL when the screen scrolls?
I only noticed it on continue/start quest

and yeah, it doesn't trigger anything, it's just a visual bug

easy fix, I just wasn't clearing the light beam bitmap in the right spot.
