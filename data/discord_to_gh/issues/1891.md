Old Report: #1835

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 12:27

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) (just pinging you to add you to the new thread, since you were working on this one)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/27/2022 06:30

Track selection is the only issue?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2022 06:31

The inability to select a track indicates not properly reading the file

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/27/2022 06:32

Oh, the old thread finally stopped being "deleted channel". Right, this is the one I was digging into but saw it was just a 0byte file lol. tacochopper uploaded a new one so I'll look into it again later this week.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2022 06:32

aye, I unarchived it
so it would appear properly again
seems your theory about that being caused by manually archiving was correct

=== @ tacochopper 09/27/2022 16:21

So on Thursday I was having a weird issue in a107/108 (the June 20 build? Whichever build numbers that is) where the same bug occurred. Only difference that I changed the quest file name through the save as function
unsure if related now because allegro 5 but I have no idea why that even happened

=== @ tacochopper 09/27/2022 16:22

Returned to the original quest file - before I renamed it - and it worked fine

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/06/2022 17:36

FYI the old thread is `#deleted-channel` again.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/06/2022 17:39

It's because discord auto-archives threads. Only way to prevent is with a bot. I'm gonna report this as a bug to discord.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2022 03:05

here's an easy workaround

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) I can't reply to that thread lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2022 01:12

oops
i thought I was posting here.

=== @ tacochopper 10/08/2022 01:12

also I assume you're using the latest nightly? I'll give it a spin when I get home and see what happens
Very confusing tbh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2022 01:13

(replying to @ tacochopper "also I assume you're using th…"): yes

=== @ tacochopper 10/08/2022 10:04

... right
those files look to work fine in this version of three crests

=== @ tacochopper 10/08/2022 10:08

while those gbs files work, i'm still getting issues with other files.

=== @ tacochopper 10/08/2022 10:11

those screenshots were in a blank, fresh quest. tried it out in three crests too but same result. here's the GBS files for reference

=== @ mitchfork 10/08/2022 13:24

So Pokemon Crystal/Game Boy Camera are the ones that don't work? I can try to confirm later

=== @ tacochopper 10/08/2022 13:38

basically anything porc tbh
Pokémon trading card game 2, donkey kong

=== @ mitchfork 10/08/2022 13:56

Weird, okay

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2022 15:54

But what about the zquest menu play thing? Any difference or also busted?

=== @ tacochopper 10/08/2022 16:21

media player works fine

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2022 21:26

yay, I just reproduced 😄

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2022 21:37

OK, so the only times I didn't hear the music play was

1) my speakers were off (doh!)
2) the music file was not exactly besides the quest file
But I was able to hear the track play after ruling out the above.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2022 21:45

when the dmap music path is saved it is only ever the _filename_
then we jump thru hoops trying multiple directories to find it
1) zc root install dir
2) .qst dir
I had the files unzipped into `PoRC/` and the quest file was somewhere else, so it couldn't load it
is this the case for you @ DeletedUser ?

=== @ tacochopper 10/09/2022 02:51

yeah this is looking like the case for me too hey

=== @ tacochopper 10/09/2022 02:53

currently, with the latest version of three crests i have all the files sitting in the same directory
so that may make sense

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/09/2022 03:10

I have idea on how to improve this

Ideally we save the music path relative to the qst file, always. And try that first.

Then fallback to the existing shit for compat

=== @ tacochopper 10/09/2022 09:22

So something like that if the music file initially in is like ZC/music, and the quest file is in ZC/quests, it'll try to look for that former file path first?

=== @ tacochopper 10/09/2022 09:23

That's how digital audio workstations work at least. Ableton has an "automatic search" function that searches for similar/same audio clips/tracks/etc in specified folders but I doubt it'd need to be that extensive for ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2022 09:24

The way it should CURRENTLY work is
Check the main ZC folder, where the exes are
Check the folder the .qst is in
Check `ZC Folder/[quest file name]_music` (and `ZC Folder/music`)
check `.qst folder/[quest file name]_music` (and `.qst folder/music`)
in that order

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 15:15

that's only for `try_zcmusic` and `try_zcmusic_ex`, but dmap music loading doesn't use that for some reason
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/blob/2.55-master/src/zc/zc_sys.cpp#L9244

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 15:21

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "that's only for `try_zcmusic`…"): oh for fucks sake
why does it not
that's absolutely a bug in itself

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/10/2022 16:29

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "that's only for `try_zcmusic`…"): Dmap should now check those. Was that the issue here?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 19:22

That was the issue here. See the code I linked to

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:27

if that's the only issue
then deedee should have a fix
(though she didn't push all of it)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 19:56

Er, sorry, that was not exactly the issue here we need to do my idea to fix the case here of just using a path relative to the quest directory (not just storing the filename)
But def a bug to not look in the "music" folder for gme stuff

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:56

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Er, sorry, that was not exact…"): ?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 19:57

Just look up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:58

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "when the dmap music path is s…"): this is intentionally how it is designed I believe
so what actually is the issue here?
it has a `char[56]` to store it in

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 20:00

it should keep the folder name if relevant

Then fall back to using just filename if that doesn't help find the file as distributed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 20:01

you'll need to add a bunch of buffer size to every dmap to handle that
because 56 chars won't hold a path
it was never intended to hold a path
use of music files that are not in the correct folders is user error
not a bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 20:03

this is why we added the new folder options
to make it easier for the user

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 20:03

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "because 56 chars won't hold a…"): of course

Forgive me for not listing out exactly the entire idea 

It is problematic still that zquest can play the file just file but the player can't
Easy fix to just store relative path name
Or maybe zee quest should be changed to notice this problem and give a warning

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 20:04

Frankly, to have ZQ just give you a warning when loading a file outside the valid folders that the file needs to be in one of (list off the valid paths) would work
jinx

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 20:06

a warning definitely seems the easier approach

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 20:09

yeah sounds good to me too

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 20:11

on startup or when you set a dmap song file?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 20:11

```
Music files can only be played from certain locations:
-The folder the program .exe is in
-The folder the .qst file is in
-From either of those folders, in a subfolder:
-...named 'music'
-...named '%s_music' (sprintf that with the quest's filename)```

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 20:11

(and wherever else songs are set)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 20:11

dmap editor on loading a file

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 20:12

zquest.cpp at `if(getname("Load DMap Music",(char*)zcmusic_types,NULL,tmusicpath,false))`
it already throws an error if the filename is >55 chars
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "```
Music files can only be p…"): could probably just add this as text in the dialog that sits there, there's space for it to just always be visible next to the box that has the music stuff in it

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1021392952515379200/1029124683662102679/unknown.png?ex=65e62b8c&is=65d3b68c&hm=546e62c6088af6f0dd7d56557ac408017bcbd8ba85c95ba13305f2f012e4cb2e&)
and then have an additional popup if you load a music file that isn't in a valid location
deedee has open changes in that function though
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
I think

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/10/2022 20:21

pushed

=== @ tacochopper 10/11/2022 01:32

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Frankly, to have ZQ just give…"): more curious than anything, but how overkill/unnecessary would a "collect" function be? going back to music workstations like ableton where you can just click one button, and it takes the files from other folders/etc and imports them into the main project folder

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2022 01:32

uhhh
....very overkill
just do that by moving them in windows explorer

=== @ tacochopper 10/11/2022 01:33

yeah was what i thought lol
just being lazy
