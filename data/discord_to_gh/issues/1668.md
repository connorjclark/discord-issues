A quest rule for whether the bottle requires the bug net, or if each empty bottle uses its own swing sprite. Also script access for those "weapons" (to hypothetically make the net or bottle reflective for silly dead man's volley)

🤢
swinging empty bottles sounds painful
very painful
there's a reason I didn't add it like that in the first place

Fair, totally fair 😝

I was just thinking since the pieces were there, it could be something like "if bottle state 0, then swing bug net (that doesn't need to be equipt or on the subscreen)". I'm sure scripting a wand or a sword to fill up a bottle is easy though, and make them interactive with stuff that way, just spit-balling now
