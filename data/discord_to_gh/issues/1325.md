cheat your way to invincibility
(4)
use the kill all enemies cheat and kill all the enemies in various rooms
for whatever reason, enemies always seem to stay dead, the rooms don't respawn after dying or going through several other rooms or even SAVING AND CONTINUING
none of them are set to stay dead

ok, so 2nd quest is working normally - enemies respawn in level-1

suspected cause: the dmap being the start dmap (even though it is an nes dungeon)
(mind you, even if that is the cause, still a bug)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2022 12:30

any leads deedee?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2022 12:33

for the time being i'll just make enemies always respawn

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 13:32

sorry, just woke up a bit ago

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 13:41

@ P-Tux7 it's because the non-beatable enemies, like the statue shooters and zoras, are keeping the enemies dead

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 13:47

...goddamnit this is gonna require a new QR ain't  it

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2022 17:00

ah mm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 17:20

@ P-Tux7 I think I added 2 QR's that might be of use
would you mind testing them for me and see if they work?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2022 17:28

of course!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 17:30

aight, just give me a few minutes...

@ P-Tux7
Added 2 new QR's:
- Unbeatable enemies don't keep the screen dead
and
- No "Leave One Enemy Alive" Trick

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2022 17:47

lmfao the latter

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/06/2022 17:47

James is gonna love that
Also, if you're designing for James, I find from the design of his games that he enjoys a sort of metroidvania progression to his type B quests
(assuming he makes his own games tailor made for his own enjoyment)
You'll want to have the player interweaving in and out of different dungeons instead of having them commit to a single dungeon
But you'll also want to make it abundantly clear; James has NPCs outright tell you when to leave a dungeon and go to another
Or he'll make it clear when he wants you to explore
He doesn't want to be stuck figuring out where to go, but I think he likes doing things in a weird, interconnected way
That's just an assumption thouhg

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2022 18:30

you'll also notice something in my upcoming demo that i put in that he also liked
namely you can get a certain thing early with foreknowledge

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2022 18:59

this works, thank you so much
6 screens eh?

food for thought for a game data setting
