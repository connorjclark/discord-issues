Been noticing this a few times now on the most recent nightly build. I'll set the Link one hand hold up sprite, and then the editor will reset the sprite tile to 000. These two screenshots are roughly 10 minutes apart - the first being the most recent time I reset the sprite, and the second having reset the sprite

=== @ Moosh 01/01/2022 13:03

Oh shit, this is an actual bug? Here I thought I was just losing it. ZC has been gaslighting the hell out of me

=== @ tacochopper 01/01/2022 13:19

i've noticed it for a few weeks now, thought i was going insane as well honestly
wasn't sure if it was something to do with my LTM setup or what
lol can report that it's happened again

=== @ tacochopper 01/01/2022 13:39

... hm
so i have zquest and classic running at the same time. before i booted up a fresh copy of the quest the hold sprite was still there. when i went back into zquest, and that sprite window, *after* i opened the quest, the hold sprite's reset itself

=== @ tacochopper 01/01/2022 13:43

YEP, can confirm it's happened again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2022 19:23

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @ tim 01/01/2022 19:40

resurfaced bug it seems

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:23

so on further testing, it only happens when both ZC and ZQ are running simultaneously. if the quest is being played without being open in the editor then the sprite works fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 03:24

. . . . . WHAT THE FUCK

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:25

i was thinking about that this morning, like what's the chances right
so i put it to the test

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 03:25

That should not be possible
having both programs running should have no effect on anything quest data related
at all
not a tiny bit

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:27

i'm gonna try and replicate it a few more times with zquest closed, but this makes no fucking sense honestly
just for reference

=== @ tim 01/02/2022 03:27

does it happen when
autosave happens
<:hmm:671849797119901710>

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:28

... possibly
although in that second screenshot
i had zquest open for a minute just to get the bug to appear

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:30

interestingly though it's not resetting the hold item sprite like it was last night
wut lol

nup spoke too soon, it reset it
running moscow modder's gb shield script so i think that may have been the cause for the trap sprite - LTM tiles

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) *what the fuck*

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 03:33

I don't know?

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:33

this is wild
closed zq and did it five times without the bug happening
i've turned off auto-saves in ZQ for the time being so i'll see if it happens with them deactivated in a bit

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:35

.... hm
it's not happening after i did a save as in ZQ, put the quest under a different name
and now i can't replicate it in the "new" retitled quest?
both open on ZC and ZQ

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 03:38

ah fuck knows, it's the like like bug all over again
i do wonder if it is related to the autosaves though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 04:32

could you send the non-retitled quest?

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 04:46

just messaged you!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 05:08

ty

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 16:33

lol it happened again. first time since earlier. auto-saves aren't turned on but i've been doing a lot of script compiling?

=== @ tacochopper 01/02/2022 16:37

and barely minutes after resetting it and having zq and zc idle, it's happened again?? i don't get it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 16:44

So, you fix it in ZQ, you save in ZQ, you load ZC, and then it works fine in ZC?
but then, without touching ZQ again, after minutes it happens again?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 16:51

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "So, you fix it in ZQ, you sav…"): If it's breaking in the middle of ZC, that means ZC itself is breaking it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 17:12

^ But keep in mind it breaking in ZC *cannot* break it in ZQ, as ZC wouldn't write it back to the quest file
so if it ALSO breaks in ZQ
it breaks separately for both
likely in qst.cpp on quest load
but that wouldn't explain it working correctly for any length of time
it should be broken from the moment you load the quest

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 20:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "^ But keep in mind it breakin…"): Except, didn't you add something that saves sfx.dat to the quest file on quest load?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 20:23

shouldn't save anything from zc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 20:23

Oh, it's just a qst loader thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 20:23

it loads it from sfx.dat into the `customtunes[]` array
same way every single compat rule or compat change works

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/02/2022 20:24

So yeah, this seems to be a qst.cpp bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2022 20:24

but that wouldn't explain it not happening for a few minutes
the question is
if you load the quest, it's broken
if you fix it, save, and reload the quest in zq, is it broken or fixed?

=== @ tacochopper 01/03/2022 00:32

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "So, you fix it in ZQ, you sav…"): I think this is about right? Although most of the times the bug’s been happening I’ve been seeing it in ZC first and then checking ZQ for the hold sprite data
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "if you fix it, save, and relo…"): I haven’t tried this yet, I’ll give it an attempt when I get up

=== @ tacochopper 01/03/2022 00:35

Every time I’ve been testing this for the last few days it’s been on a clean quest save. Not sure if that’s got anything to do with it but figure that might help regardless

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2022 00:35

that's always a good thing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/03/2022 12:58

I am very weirded out
I cannot reproduce this

=== @ tacochopper 01/03/2022 13:27

i reproduced it earlier again with the new quest lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/03/2022 13:27

wtf

=== @ tacochopper 01/03/2022 13:27

maybe we see if @ Moosh can make it happen
if it's happened to both of us then there's a solid chance it could be a similar cause, right?

=== @ tim 01/04/2022 00:12

uh
who first reported this

=== @ tim 01/04/2022 00:13

@ FireSeraphim
this is the same thing you had happen a few months back, ye?

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/04/2022 00:15

a similar thing yeah.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2022 06:22

It isn't the same thing
FS's issue was that the Flip value was being set to an absurdly high number somehow, and my fix for that was to cap the Flip value

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2022 06:24

@ DeletedUser could you go to the About page (should be under ZC/ZQ/Etc) in ZQuest and screenshot it?
I need to know what build specifically you are using so I can build a debug build where I can reproduce it

=== @ tacochopper 01/04/2022 09:41

Sure, I’ll get that together after I’ve finished work

is there a newer nightly out or is that still on the way?

still on the way; unsure if P-Tux is done testing or not but there's a few issues I want to iron out

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2022 14:54

I didn't change anything but see if you can reproduce the issue in the latest code
This isn't confirmed stable, but see if this fixes the issue

wanna say around ten times?
basically just soft resetting until it occurred. initially i was going into the shop and purchasing an item and the hold up sprite was fine. this time it only happened after i put the item on the starting screen for ease of access
and sure enough, the sprite reset

=== @ tacochopper 01/04/2022 15:23

hm, it's only happened once in twenty resets
feels like shiny hunting in pokemon

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:06

*sigh*
Alright, time to go digging again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:07

I'm baffled
If it ***ever*** shows correctly in ZC, it can't be qst.cpp, can it?

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:09

help me understand what else even has the power to change that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:09

From everything I can see here
I'd guess that a demon has posessed the program and decided to fuck with us
By far the most likely cause

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:12

now here's my question
is it actually setting the tile to zero
or it is being nulled into 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:12

... what's the difference?
NULL == 0

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:13

some code that is overwriting it vs some code that is removing the setting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:13

... what's the difference?

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:13

exactly what i just stated

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:13

Those both are `= 0;`
There is no difference between "removing" something and "overwriting it to 0"

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:14

there 100% is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:14

Then if you could elaborate

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:16

I think tim means if it's writing to something so high that it gets set to 0 for being too high
Which, I don't *think* it's handled that way? I think it'd just overflow and display a garbage value

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:16

There shouldn't be a "too high" for tiles anymore
It'd wrap, yeah

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:17

so i may have answered my own question
if something is unset, it usually shows a black tile, not even tile 0, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:18

Depends on the dialogue
Some dialogs draw tile 0 as tile 0

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:18

unless im still thinking in 2004

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:19

Others don't draw it if it's 0, thus showing the empty square
Both represent the same exact value

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:21

(replying to @ tim "unless im still thinking in 2…"): If something isn't *initialized*, it will grab random memory
so a random number each time probably
if something is set to NULL, it's just 0.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:22

Here we're getting 0, so something is probably nulling it somewhere
The oddity is that it doesn't break immediately in zc
But, that it doesn't JUST break in ZC, it also affects ZQ
Either there are two very similar but different bugs
Or the laws of physics are breaking down
Because while ZQ can affect ZC (error in the qst file,  for ex)
ZC ***cannot affect ZQ***
ZQ never loads any files that have been touched by ZC
There should be no possible way for that to happen

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:24

as the only thing ZC is actually writing is
cfg and sav

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:25

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Because while ZQ can affect Z…"): See, here's the thing, ZC loads the entire quest into memory when starting up
So it really shouldn't be ZQuest affecting ZC
you can delete the entire quest file IIRC or save over it IIRC and the changes won't take place until after you go back to the file select

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:26

No but, if the error is when saving the quest file...
Then ZQ affects ZC
Nothing to do with them both running at the same time
i.e. if ZQ were saving the tile wrong
But, that doesn't seem to be the case either

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:30

so there has to be some missing bracket somewhere
or something is setting this option while another command is being thrown
there has to be some command that is doing it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:31

Something has to be setting it to 0 in a file that both ZC and ZQuest call

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:31

and its only during some other option being set

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:32

And it has to be something that's consistently doing it in both simultaneously

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:36

*leers at allegro.log*

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:45

just left zq running for the past 20 mins
and box in question just has no image

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:46

?
What tile is it set to?

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:46

0 with a blank image

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:47

Oh?

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:47

resetting zq brings it back. let me see if it rots away again in the timeframe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:48

Definitely nothing qst.cpp then

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:52

🙂
look what the tile was just randomly set to

this is just zq open

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 20:56

so what is the relevance of this tile besides it being the last tile allowed in pages

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:57

FLIP
of course it's fucking flip
And Tile
retghbsedhysf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:57

`setlinktile()` is one of the only things that modifies those values
and that is ONLY called when you hit OK after having clicked one of those squares in that dialog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:00

`setuplinktiles()` also modifies them, setting them to defaults; but that only occurs in qst.cpp on loading a quest, before it has read the sprites from the quest
the values can also be affected by `moving` tiles
because link sprites are set up (at least old ones, don't know if the new ones were...) to move if you move it's source tile
but that only writes the tile, not the flip

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:03

Okay, see, here's the other thing
SetSprite caps Flip at 3
Which means on being loaded, the sprites should be capped

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:04

yeah, that was our attempt at fixing this last time

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:04

it's worth noting that this is probably random memory overflowing from whatever is *before* the 1 handed hold sprite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:05

hmmm
`sideswimcastingspr`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:05

Given that the value being affected is [0][0][0] of an array

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:07

don't see anything immediately
and that's assuming that global variables in memory are guaranteed to be contiguous, which I'm not sure if is true?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:08

...wait a fucking moment
wait a fucking moment
`int32_t holdspr[2][3][3];`
that's `[2][3][3]`
not `[2][2][3]`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:09

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:09

someone expanded it

in the middle
WHY
WHY
It isn't being cleared or set properly

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:09

He wanted to add a Sword Holding Sprite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:09

it's clearing `2*2*3*sizeof(int32_t)`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:09

and there's stuff in qst.cpp that sets that
...ah.
I see

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:10

i reset and let it rot again

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:11

WAIT, wtf
It just happened to me too in P-Tux's quest!
uhirjnskfgdbrfnzkdteshdnytj

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:11

and you werent doing
ANYTHING
🙂
so the ZC being running thing is just a fluke

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:14

but it also has to be *happening* in zc
if it happens to them in ZC without saving the quest again in ZQ

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:14

erm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:14

it means it has to be a shared file
Okay, so I'm gonna break this specific value and let it rot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:15

zoria's added holdspr, you mean?
smart

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:15

this time it happened within a minute of loading zq

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:15

frankly, tim
I have a feeling it happens when you open the dialog

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:15

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "zoria's added holdspr, you me…"): nah, the holdspr that's breaking

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:15

???

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:16

yeah its def

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:16

As in I'm gonna let it sit and it'll alert me when it changes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:16

Just remove something that's been fine for a decade, instead of the new thing that probably broke it?

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:16

loading the dia

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:16

oh
wait
I see
brain isn't reading what you were saying

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 21:16

ah good i was about to ping you deedee

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:16

hmm

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 21:16

this is the only nasty bug i know of in this latest build

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:17

if i load the dia and hit cancel, then reopen the dia its corrupted. yea

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:17

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "this is the only nasty bug i…"): No crashes or anything?
Okay, then once we fix this issue then we can release Alpha 101

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:19

qdbufouwgwg
it only happens when i hit cancel

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:20

IUJNEFRVDNK
That's it
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) just confirmed it, it's the cancelling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:21

pahahahaha
becuase deedee
it's your memcpy of `oldHoldSpr`
which isn't sized right

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:21

fuck me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:21

because of Zoria's addition

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:21

Ah, cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:21

like I said, that new sprite was NOT ADDED CORRECTLY

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:21

Lovely

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:21

it was not fucking resized anywhere

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:21

Zoria's a dumbass

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:21

yay innovation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:22

I have no clue how this would happen in ZC just running, though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:22

It has to be a similar issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:22

frankly, patch that, and then we see if the issue even still occurs
should just need to resize your `oldHoldSpr` and the memcpy sizes
also, for fucks sake
`2*2*3*sizeof(int32_t)`?
Pretty sure you can just do `sizeof(holdspr)`
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:23

i love when the quadratic formula explodes

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 21:26

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "No crashes or anything?"): nope!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:33

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) the dumb was me
```memcpy(sideswimholdspr, oldSideSwimHoldSpr, 4 * 3 * sizeof(int32_t));```
...That should be 3\*3, not 4*3

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:33

oh
rip
also, again
try `sizeof(sideswimholdpsr)`
that should just
do it for you

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 21:34

eh, already commit the 3*3

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 21:34

that is, for the record, one of the differences between pointers and arrays
while you can use an array as a pointer in any circumstance
`sizeof()` on an array will give you the full array's size
`sizeof()` on a pointer gives you the size of... the pointer, not what it points to.

@ DeletedUser see if you still have the same issue with these

=== @ tim 01/05/2022 21:50

no cancel-break here

=== @ tacochopper 01/05/2022 23:05

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@ DeletedUser see if…"): I will suss shortly and let you know!
