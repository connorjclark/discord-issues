ok so, latest nightly aug 9th windows 64-bit

Trying to cap off https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1135030471076610198/1137610635182612540 

Made a new replay. Exit test mode ZC, open ZC normally, try to load a replay. There is a replay file in the folder (confirmed externally) but ZC shows the folder as empty. 
It seems to be limited only to replays cuz trying to load a quest file normally, directories are populated normally in the directory browser in ZC.
