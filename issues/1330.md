If using a Lens of Truth close enough to the signpost and in one of the directions it can be talked to in, the message is displayed. One would presumably set the signpost to accept no buttons for input, or if that's impossible, then the flag would disable button reading of the signpost combo.

If there's any remaining flags for lenses, a "Can Read Gossip Stones" one might be cool too.

```//Gossip stone. Displays message when viewed with Lend of truth
//D0 - string.
ffc script GossipStone{
    void run (int str){
        bool cd = true;
        while (true){
            int vis=0;
            int lens = GetCurrentItem(IC_LENS);
            if (lens>=0){
                itemdata it = Game->LoadItemData(lens);
                vis = it->Attributes[0];
            }
            if (cd){
                if (UsingItem(lens)&& Link->MP>0){
                    int distx = CenterX(this) - CenterLinkX();
                    int disty = CenterY(this) - CenterLinkY();
                    int dis = DistanceSquared( distx, disty );
                    
                    if (dis<=(vis*vis)){
                        Game->PlaySound(32);
                        Screen->Message(str);
                        cd=false;
                    }
                }
            }
            else if (UsingItem(lens)|| Link->MP==0) cd=true;
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
My first 2.55 script...

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "If using a Lens of Truth clos…"): To be frank here, the simplest way to implement this is with string control codes. Just have it jump to the real message if you have the lens, or `mask of truth`, or whatever item you want it to be; and a default message otherwise.
Using the lens to trigger it feels a little jank to me, honestly; I'd want a gossip stone to work just like a sign for triggering
and with SCCs you can already make that work
