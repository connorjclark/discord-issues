In Alpha 111, enhanced music (GBS or otherwise) does not play.
(meta) thread name was changed: Enhanced Music is Nonfunctional

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 17:35

where are the music files located relative to zc

=== @ Matthew 11/04/2022 17:35

The music files are in the same folder as the quest file.
I've tried with both .mp3 and .gbs files.

=== @ Matthew 11/04/2022 17:38

Yeah, even with music in the correct position, the issue persists.
Shane is having similar troubles.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 17:40

gbs and tracker files was fixed though.
The only remaining part of that bug was an indicator in zquest that the music is not findable
I don't recall when this fix landed, was it in 111

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 17:41

apparently not, according to this report

(just for reference)

=== @ Shane 11/04/2022 17:45

I tried out the latest nightly, it's present there too.
It could be quest file related since Mitchfork said he got gbs to work in the latest nightly.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 17:46

Yeah just in case, can you upload the relevant files

=== @ Matthew 11/04/2022 17:52

Ok
So the music is playing in one dmap but not the other. There is no apparent difference in settings.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 17:52

....what the fuck
Screenshot of both dmap editor music tabs?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 17:53

Does order of loading (the dmaps) matter?
Wondering if just the first works

=== @ Matthew 11/04/2022 17:54

ok
test area dmap: music works
kakariko village: doesnt, even though its an exact duplicate with just palette changes
let me upload what I have.

=== @ Matthew 11/04/2022 17:56

oh nvm
it was the screen midi being (none) which was overwriting enhanced music
i think crisis averted
user error

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 17:59

an option called `(none)` for midis overwrote enhanced music??

=== @ Matthew 11/04/2022 18:01

yeahhhh

Goofy of me to miss but also kind of unintuitive
the default works fine, which is Use DMap MIDI

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 18:01

aye, none is not the default
use dmap midi is the default

=== @ Matthew 11/04/2022 18:02

In terms of labelling though, I wonder if its worth to change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 18:02

if that dropdown is anything but `use dmap midi`, it overrides the dmap's music entirely
A `?` button next to it would help a lot
but
to add `?` buttons and suhc
requires
rewriting
the entire
dmap
dialog

=== @ Matthew 11/04/2022 18:02

omfg

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 18:02

because it still isn't on the new system

=== @ Matthew 11/04/2022 18:02

what if the labels within the box were changed
to be more reflective of what this is doing
idk
its not a big deal either way

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 18:14

`(None) – disable all music` sound good to me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 18:15

if you can add that that'd be absolutely fine
