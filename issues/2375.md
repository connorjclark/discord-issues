When on the file select menu, I think "Register Your Name", "Copy File", and "Delete File" should respond to both the A and Start buttons.  It responding to Start only is just an outdated NES design trend and this would help people figure the menu out better.

The way that existing save slots respond to Start/A differently is totally fine and I'm not suggesting any changes to it.
