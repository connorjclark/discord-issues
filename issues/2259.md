Basically when I'm trying to copy+paste then offset the combo's tiles in the editor (basically using the ctrl+plus or ctrl+shift+plus keyboard shortcut )and the combo already has an animation, the animation ends up offseting itself by one tile diagonally and generally messing up the animation in resulting tile. This issue is irritating, especially when I have a bunch of tiles for NPCs or tiles that are set up similarly. The combo editor should not animate at all, infact I think the best solution would be to revert the change that allowed the combo editor to start animating.

. . . ? ? ?
what the hell is actually wrong here?

the fuck are you talking about

It advances the animation one frame when you move in the combo editor, or copy and paste anything in the combo editor
and I'm not crazy

1.go to a combo and copy it, make sure the combo has an animation set already
2.paste the combo elsewhere
3.use the ctrl+plus or the ctrl+minus keyboard shortcuts on the resulting combo, make sure the resulting offseted tiles has the same animation as the original tiles the combo had. For the worst results, go ahead and use both shortcuts a few times. (ctrl+plus and ctrl+minus should only be offseting the combo vertically, not horizontally as well!)

4.watch in horror as combo animates incorrectly due to the combo editor new (and unneeded) animation function screwing up the combo's animation offset

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/27/2023 17:57

I found the only way to prevent this is go into the editor's options and disable animation, which kinda sucks

.....the "animation mode" you are talking about is not remotely new that's 2.50.2 or earlier
I don't know what ctrl+plus/ctrl+minus are even supposed to do
so I'll have to take a look at this

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/27/2023 17:58

ctrl+plus/ctrl+minus and suppose to change the starting tile of a combo to the tile above or below it on the tile page

which would normally make setting up a bunch of combos that had similar animations, like say NPCs easy.

I think you should provide a video

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/27/2023 19:37

...ahk, should be fixed.
and super cleaned up too
your report wasn't the most sensical, but, the issues were obvious enough once I looked at those keybinds.
@ FireSeraphim please test for me in the nightly that'll come out in ~30min

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/27/2023 20:40

Yeah, it fixes it
