As of the newest nightly, both 32 and 64 bit builds, the launcher window cannot be moved like a regular window and cannot be resized. Additional, due to the ongoing Windows Scaling Issues (https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/995119534581235793), the unmoveable window is so tiny as to be barely useable

Yeah it's cuz I removed the frame from the window ... So we'd either need to revert that change, or make it so that the title bar that z GUI draws knows how to move the real window
Really don't want to do that second bit so I'll probably just revert it

Oh another option is to also remove the title bar that z launcher draws to fix the original issue I had here... Is that two title bars look weird

I kinda wish ZLauncher could be minimized to the bar. It currently lack a minimize button and that kinda doesn't help since I have ZLauncher pinned to my taskbar and when I launch it there it doesn't properly show up on as a tab on the taskbar. It works otherwise but that's kinda jank and bad
