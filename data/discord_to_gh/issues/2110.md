Item classes of the formerly-room-type techniques. This now means that they can be obtained as items and be given more dynamically by SCCs. This is great for "character classes" made by giving the player certain items, as seen in Nostalrul.
I can't really imagine any attributes for Scroll: Slash.
Attributes for Scroll: Magic Divisor
Power: Your current magic usage is divided by this amount. Set it to 2 for half-magic, 3 for third-magic, etc. If that's too hard, then it can be changed to have its Power be the amount of times your magic is halved - 1 for half-magic, 2 for quarter-magic, etc.

...I wouldn't call them scrolls
because, they wouldn't work like other scrolls do
they wouldn't be `Equipment Item`s that you have multiple levels of
they would be more similar to heart/magic containers, in that they have an effect one-time on pickup
....it's really easy to do this with a script

```cpp
@Author("EmilyV")
itemdata script pickupLearnSlash
{
    void run()
    {
        Game->Generic[GEN_CANSLASH] = true;
    }
}
@Author("EmilyV"),
@InitD0("Divide By"),
@InitDHelp0("Divide the current magic drain rate by this much\n"
"If '0', grants infinite magic\n"
"If not '0', will never set the drain rate below '1'.")
itemdata script pickupMagicSaver
{
    void run(int divide_by)
    {
        if(divide_by==0) //unlimited magic
            Game->Generic[GEN_MAGICDRAINRATE] = 0;
        else //lower magic usage
        {
            int newrate = Round(Game->Generic[GEN_MAGICDRAINRATE] / divide_by);
            Game->Generic[GEN_MAGICDRAINRATE] = Max(1,newrate);
        }
    }
}```
`pickupLearnSlash` as an item pickup script functions as learn slash room type

...There. Built-in help text.
Compile the script, and it'll show up in the `?` button in the item editor when you assign the script
for `pickupMagicSaver`, `0` for infinite magic, otherwise it divides your magic rate by the set amount, with a minimum of 1.
....could add it in-engine, but not high priority. These scripts will work just as well.

I mean, default tileset?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2022 10:14

current default tileset will include 0 scripts
in the future when we make a new default tileset via contest, we can include a version with and without

=== @ P-Tux7 12/27/2022 10:22

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "current default tileset will…"): Yeah, that's my motive for these things being scriptless
