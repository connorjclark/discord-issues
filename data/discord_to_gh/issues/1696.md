In 2.53, Zoria made certain Item->Pickup flags (most notably IP_FADE) read/writeable by script. This change does not appear to have made its way to 2.55, leading to inconsistent behaviour. It would be great if they could once again be made accessible by scripts

Err @ Russ
the code blocks I'm seeing in 2.53 and 2.55 for `itemsprite->Pickup` are identical

my only guess would be this:```cpp
        if (( FFCore.GetQuestVersion() == 0x250 && FFCore.GetQuestBuild() < 33 ) //this ishowit looks in 2.53.1, Beta 25
            || ( FFCore.GetQuestVersion() < 0x250  ))
        {
            newpickup &= ~(ipBIGRANGE | ipCHECK | ipMONEY | ipBIGTRI | ipNODRAW | ipFADE);
        }```
which means, notably, that older quests need to be re-saved in a newer version in order to allow these to be writable

So, the question here is, what's actually wrong here? It looks all right...

=== @ Russ 06/26/2022 21:22

```item1->Pickup |= 64;```
This is what is set in my 2.53 quest

So yeah, this is janky as absolute shit and Zoria has no clue what he's doing
and needs to be re-written at some point....
