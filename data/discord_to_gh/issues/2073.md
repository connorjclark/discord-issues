It's really just when recording?

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 02:38

Crap, I am not having it happen now
Should I close this?
wait, those issues were with the build you sent

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 02:39

Ok

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 02:40

I may just not included some fixes in my branch. I'll double check. Didn't touch anything related to bitmaps or scripts...

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 02:40

Yea I cannot replicate that issue

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 02:57

I just replicated it
Give me a second to gather information

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 02:58

As of now ZC just closes when I attempt to load a new save
nothing useful printed in console
when it doesnt close I get this

I'm confused about which build you're on rn

New build w/ input bug fix + all latest changes will be here in about 15 minutes: https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases

I'll be stepping out for a couple hours before it finishes, so check back soon and let me know if this build has a similar problem. If so, it seems likely related to something entirely unrelated to the input bug changes, and just a problem with latest nightlies.

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 03:23

that is what I figured, I highly doubt the issues are related
Sorry if I wasn't being clear on things

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 03:24

No problem, there's a lot of moving parts here

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 03:25

at least the original problem was fixed haha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2022 15:05

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> @ Deathrider I know what was wrong here
same thing I just fixed from like 3 other reports
if it happens again, recompile scripts.
(in the build that just went out or newer)

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 15:15

But the file I played here was newly compiled in the dec 7 build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2022 15:16

There was a bug that would have caused exactly these issues that I just fixed
As in, literally fixed this morning and just posted a build of

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 15:20

Oh I see, didnt realize it was *just* fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2022 15:21

Lejes just reported 2 new issues
... Which were both this one issue.

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 15:22

this one? ``Docs Updates / Function Deprecation by @EmilyV#406699 in #836``

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2022 15:23

....that nightly, yes, though that PR message has nothing to do with this

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 15:24

right, just wanted to identify the nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2022 15:24

(could just say the nightly name then)
`2022-12-08-2`
those are always unique

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2022 15:26

Also, in the future, any `Invalid ZASM command` errors you get shouldn't crash shit anymore
the moment it throws one of those errors, it terminates the script that threw the error, preventing it from cascading into a random crash

=== @ Deathrider 12/09/2022 01:28

I do not have this issue anymore with replays on and off

=== @ Deathrider 12/09/2022 01:48

this bug report can probably be closed, at least from my perspective
