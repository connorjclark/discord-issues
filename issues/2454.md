It would be helpful if there was an option to make it so that when you select multiple combos in the combo pane, and you click on the screen, they only get placed once before the combo selector goes back to 1x1, It would make the combo placement process smoother. Even better would be if there was a shortcut for this (for example, Alt + Selecting multiple combos to make them a one-time only placement).

Added, holding `Alt` when you click to select an area will make it revert after placing once.
