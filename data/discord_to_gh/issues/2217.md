A QR that causes EWeapons to always spawn from the center of enemies instead of their upper-left corner. It would fix graphical/logical weirdness associated with resizing such enemies. (It would "screw up" Ganon's projectile's NES-accuracy by making it come from his center instead of upper-left, but I always considered that an NES deficiency and I'm sure anyone who wants to use this QR and make giant enemies would be perfectly fine with that.)

Bosses might need to have exceptions coded into them, or just have the logic apply to Walking, Wizzrobe, Zora, Ganon, Other, and Other (Floating)-class enemies.

(I know someone suggested having an X offset and Y offset box for every enemy's projectile in the Enemy Editor, but that might be overkill to store for all 512 enemies... especially given how many enemies CAN'T shoot projectiles, though they might in the future. Possibly an NPC or EWeapon script function that can offset an enemy's projectile?)
