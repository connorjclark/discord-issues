Oh boy it's a database script crash!
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=533
Tested with the example quest off the database in the newest nightly. Traces indicate the line that's doing it is
```slots[slot]->DrawToScreen(8, 32);```
Specifically when that function exits. It runs the trace I put at the end of the function, but not the one directly after it.

Seems like the first instance of a function from that class that isn't the constructor. So could be something to do with class functions (but not constructors or functions called in constructors) in a RunFrozen() generic script that's called from another generic script that runs from start. That sounds wicked specific

Could be to do with this commit maybe? It happened before the 17th because that was the first build I encountered this in

And got confirmation from Nightmare that the 4-17 nightly is the one where it broke

(replying to @ Moosh "Could be to do with this comm…"): Not unless you are using the NEW SCC that did not previously exist

Can you narrow it to an exact nightly?
(Would do it myself, but by god there's so many bug reports that just came in....)
