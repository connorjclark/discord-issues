Would be a nice time saver not having to switch to cset 2 combo page 45 every time I want to select a piece for something like the dungeon carving tool.

=== @ Phosphor 09/26/2023 19:37

*scratch the cset part already, it does that and I'm just stupid not remembering that part

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/26/2023 19:58

This same suggestion applies to the Secret Combos dialogue as well.  Having a _global_  "Remember Cset, Tile Page, and Tile" value that the entire quest references might be interesting.

Kinda strange that the only thing that actually does this is the alias tool

I remember asking koopa about that, way back in the day.  He was my buddy.  Very low key, unknown ZC dev over a decade ago or something.  I can't believe he did that. ❤️

(replying to @ Phosphor "Would be a nice time saver no…"): Missed this one somehow. Does ctrl+click accomplish what you're asking for? Pretty sure this is already a thing in the common combo panel widget I used for the GUI

^ yeah, ctrl+click just does this in ALL new dialogs for combo selectors
and pretty sure tile selectors too

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/29/2023 14:55

That it does.  Very useful.  Thank ye.
Anything for the Secret combo pane yet?

Still doing that in the latest nightly.  Not saying anything was changed, but an illustration is always nice.
That's one panel that could _really_ use a "Set all to latest" button or something.  Because Ctrl-Clicking does what that screenshot says, so Ctrl-Clicking is already taken.
... and shift-clicking rotates the Cset, but BLAZINGLY quickly.  It's a regular _rave_ in there.

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2023 22:08

oh yup. That sure is an old dialog, handling things how it pleases...

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2023 22:11

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) how would you suggest modifying the combo selector widget to have custom behavior such as changing flags?
...also previewing flags with F? oh lord this one sounds annoying to rewrite
