This would be a graphics data menu where you can select which of the four options applies to each subject in the quest. There might also be a good argument for having the CSet for option 3 be selectable, but CSet 11 should be fine in a pinch if it's better off hardcoded.

Options:
1. Z1 (6-7-8-9) (Y'know, Auto-Flash))
2. Flicker
3. GB/BS (Current CSet-Single other CSet)
4. None

Subjects
1. Hurt Player
2. Clocked Player
3. Hurt Enemies
4. Stunned Enemies (LTTP)
5. Charged Weapons in-hand (Sword and Hammer, for now) (GB)
Letting charged CSet be selectable per-weapon might be neat, but I know those two item classes are already crammed full of options, so no biggie.

I should probably note that the Auto-Flash option currently uses the Zelda 1-type palette cycling (the 6-7-8-9 mentioned above - actually, IIRC, it uses whatever CSet the sprite is set to, then the three CSets following that. I should go test it out right quick with something that uses, say, CSet 0. Or 10...ü§î) if the "BS Zelda Animation Quirks" quest rule is off.

Oops yeah thanks
