I think it would help a bit to have an option in tile warp or side warp to display a Zquest style minimap destination over ZC style minimap with the blue dots that you can toggle.  I can see the map better with the Zquest style with the level palette dots in it.

Same request for defining Compass and Continue screen ID in DMap editor.

...what?

This is a mock up of what i'm explaining.  Have a toggle "Switch Map Style" button that will switch the Zelda player style map to Zquest style map.

These are the blue dots I'm talking about just to clarify.

I love the idea, and have always wanted something like this, (It'd speed things up SO MUCH.)  but I have no idea how Dmap sliders could be taken into account.
