Basically I'd like to suggest a button in the tile editor that turns on a quadrant crosshair while editing sprites. Something what's shown in the screenshot. Reason for this being that a lot of retro sprites are built on 8x8 subtiles so being able to see where those cutoff is helpful. Ideally this could also be toggled with a keystroke (e.g. tab), but I'd be fine if it was just a button.

you know, that's just smart

Not being sarcastic or anything, but this is one of the best ideas I've ever heard, and I'm kicking myself that I didn't suggest it first. 

Having a button to duplicate or mirror these quadrants would be incredible as well.  I can't tell you how many times activities in these quadrants are done.

Yeah I was tempted to also suggest like a mirroring option for drawing tiles. Being able to reflect across the x/y axis would be very nice and would fit along with having quadrant delimiters.

the buttons... basically work like checkboxes, it just works nicer using buttons for this menu. (the buttons stay indented to show they are active)
if the quarter-grid lines are off, it disables all of the draw mode buttons- but remembers which ones are pressed if you check the quarter-grid lines back on.
(it does NOT remember between sessions, it always resets to unchecked)

What does diag flip do
Reflect one corner to the other?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2023 03:32

It's basically horizontally and vertically flipped
which is also the exact same as 180 rotated

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/08/2023 03:32

Gotcha
Regardless, lovely work, much obliged

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2023 03:32

(checking hflip and vflip does not just do diag flip, it does hflip and vflip *separately*)
(so, you can use any combination of the modes together)
(should work for all tools)

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/08/2023 03:33

So is the h-flip/etc the same as pressing h/v

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2023 03:33

except maybe selection ones

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/08/2023 03:33

or is it like, a mirroring mode

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2023 03:33

it's a mirror drawing mode
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345)"): So like, you see the green pixels here? I draw the bottom-left one, with HFlip and VFlip active. HFlip drew the bottom-right one, VFlip drew the top-left.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2023 04:01

also, I let TAB toggle it

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/08/2023 04:11

Awesome
Will be very helpful.
