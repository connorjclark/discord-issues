A supplementary QR to the Z1 bosses can spawn anywhere QR where if they are not told to spawn somewhere using an enemy flag, they spawn at their Z1/2.50 location instead of randomly. It's impossible to "manually place" a few enemies in the correct place such as Gleeoks using combo flags
I think this applies to
-Aquamentus left/right
-Manhandla?
-Gleeok
-Gohma
-Ganon
-Zora
-Boulders?
-Moldorm
-Lanmola
-NOT traps because i'm pretty sure their "hardcoded" spawn location would be 0,0

Gleeoks you can using the "Center X rule" or whatever it's called, but it needs to be applied on ALL the bosses, not just Gleeoks.  Gohmas are off-center too among other guilty parties

Aquamentus
I tried to make a setup of three in a stack. Didn't quite work so I asked for this

This is the rule in question needed to fix the old location spawn points

Needs to be on all bosses, not just Gleeok
As an option
