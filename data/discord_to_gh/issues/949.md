Also, this is more of a module request I think than a feature request, so I don't think I should open a feature reequest thread... but, it would kind of neat if, in the future, there were packs of all the preserved entries to past Nth quest contests, including the non-winners and the disqualified entries. If anyone still has those handy, like Nightmare maybe

If this happens, try to include the unedited versions of 4th before they got stitched together into the released 4th
