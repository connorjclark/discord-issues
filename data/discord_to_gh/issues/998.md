So we things like Traps, Rocks and Fireball shooters
Id like to see more stuff like fake doors from Mimish Cap and firebars from Alttp are these enemys just as hard to add as other enemies?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2021 02:33

firebars have been done so far with ffc scripts and can surely be done with npc scripts
and fake doors are just temporary  step -> next + copycats that cycle from non-damaging to damaging then back again
though if you want more than one per screen you might need a script yeah

no new enemies until rewrite

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2021 02:52

that sounds like 2 years at minimum. not encouraging

trying to modify enemies just is not happening
because spaghetti mess firy burning destroying the entire engine if we try

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2021 03:09

oh i'm dumb
this is engine enemies only
not "engine OR scripted"
that's why i made so much ado of the potential script solutions
