See video. The water and pitfalls shown are consistently sending the player to the incorrect screens when attempting to respawn, always off of the map. Note that the pitfalls shown are not set to warp the player.

Note it also inexplicably respawns me on top of water instead of on land. The beach screen does not use the "unsafe ground" flag anywhere
Be sure to take note of the position on the minimap
