I remember a long time ago testing if you could set Link->Jump while LA_SWIMMING was happening, and it worked pretty well as far as I could tell. So it'd be neat to have an option on Roc's Feathers where you could jump while you're in water. 

(Ideally this would be a distinct option from sideview swimming; in LA I think you could jump out of the sideview water, but not the overhead.)

i think there's a bigger issue in that i don't think any items can work while swimming, i know the whistle doesn't
do potions, even?

don't think any items do, aye
because diving

this would have been more feasible pre-a/ex1/ex2 item usage because a was just for the sword/diving

I guess the controls are a tricky issue. Maybe the feather could just override the dive command if it's on the same button?
once you _have_ jumped out of the water, you can use other items in midair until you fall in, and I think that worked okay when I tried it
