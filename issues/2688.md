When I'm cycling through csets, I might press minus a couple times, but if I press it twice, it opens up the (quite outdated) help menu, interrupting the whole thing.

?
Pressing minus twice.... just lowers the CSet by 2
@ Seboops are you sure you aren't hitting F1 (the Help hotkey in most programs?)

=== @ Seboops 09/27/2023 01:25

That also works
it doesn't do anything on your end?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2023 01:26

minus twice lowers the cset by 2 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

=== @ Seboops 09/27/2023 01:26

It definitely opens the help menu on my end
and it doesn't seem to care how long I wait before pressing again
and it works with both minuses

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2023 01:58

I honestly have no idea what to tell you; this does not happen for me, nor do I know of any code that could *possibly* cause this on our end
Does your keyboard like, read double-minus as `F1` or something?

=== @ Seboops 09/27/2023 01:58

oh wait
I made an auto hotkey that registers minus minus as ‚Äî

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2023 01:58

...that might do it
lol

=== @ Seboops 09/27/2023 01:59

but why in the world would ‚Äî bring up help?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2023 01:59

what key is `‚Äî`?

=== @ Seboops 09/27/2023 01:59

it's not even a key on the keyboard

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2023 01:59

yeah, so like
what is your autohotkey script doing
to insert it

=== @ Seboops 09/27/2023 02:00

I think it deletes the two minus things and then makes a ‚Äî
this is the whole script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2023 02:00

...guessing that somehow is being read as pressing `F1` in some way by allegro?
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

=== @ Seboops 09/27/2023 02:01

That is the weirdest thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2023 02:01

recommendation is to disable the script

=== @ Seboops 09/27/2023 02:01

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2023 02:01

there's literally nothing we can do to fix it, it's gotta be something in how the autohotkey is processing that
glad we at least figured it out lol!

=== @ Seboops 09/27/2023 02:02

yeah ü§£

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2023 02:02

also, for future reference, a report like this would belong in #deleted-channel not #deleted-channel
(Discord literally doesn't allow moving threads or anything between channels, so....)

=== @ Seboops 09/27/2023 02:09

yeah I thought it was an old feature or something
