How hard would it be to have the internal map maker change palletes to the ZQ editor pallete setting per screen? It would be great for speeding up the process of putting together a preview map.

100% impossible
>256 colors at once is completely impossible
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîíUse palletes per screen function - for map maker

can zq output .bmps that are over 256 colours, though?

Not that I'm aware, no
Allegro limitations

ah dang

Theoretically it could if we completely went around allegro, but that would be such an absurd amount of work that it isn't remotely worth it

yeah i was thinking that maybe it could spit out like uh... an image of all the screens on a particular map with X screen palette, with the other screens being filled with transparency, do this with a new image for every screen palette on the map, and then overlay them to produce the full map image
it's just that that last step does require at least some level of truecolour processing capability

Exactly
That's the impossible part
...I wrote a script (posted it somewhere) that basically does the whole first part by teleporting you and screenshotting every screen
