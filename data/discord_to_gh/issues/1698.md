When interacting with a dialog in a way that causes it to call for a redraw, you are able to see as each individual proc refreshes.

Realistically, it should not be drawing anything to the actual screen until `update_hw_screen()` is next called, which SHOULD prevent this flickering as everything redraws; blaming A5 upgrade for this, not sure what the hell is the specific cause though. @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

what was wrong?

BTW, the issue was this:

Allegro legacy a5_display is now what draws to the actual screen, in its own thread. call it the display thread.

update_hw_screen blits the main screen to the bitmap that the display thread draws from. This only happens on the main thread

Notice there is a thread contention issue here, two threads can't access this bitmap at the same time

The gui code already resolved that by doing acquire_screen / release_screen in the gui code, within each components handling the for MSG_DRAW event.

However, it wasn't wrapping the entire check_for_redraw logic in a similar lock/release, which meant that the display thread would very likely do a redraw while the gui code was only partially done doing its thing

aaaah
makes sense
thread shenanigans are always troublesome

yes that should work

Not sure if same problem or just similar, but the mouse flashes on the tile and combo pages
