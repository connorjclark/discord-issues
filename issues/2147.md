So, if you stab on the frame right before you walk through a bombed dungeon wall, Link moves through it with that animation frame playing instead of the walking frames. Bombed dungeon walls must have suction turned on (Z1-style) for this to happen.

Great, thanks. I just checked and it even works with the spin-attack walk. This can be closed
