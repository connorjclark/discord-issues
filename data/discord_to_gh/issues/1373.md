The latest Alpha 2.55 i just updated to 103 is now ignoring Custom Quest Save File Icons.

The top is supposed to show My Mermaid sprite Icon instead.*

Oh wait ..
It's only doing this if a file is created before ever updating to the next version 2.55 Alpha up

You have to make a new save file for the quest icons to change. They don't change even when you change them in the quest they are permanently loaded in ZC for that one save file. If you make a new save file and cheat to give yourself a ring and then save, that save file will show the updated icon because it was created after you changed it in the quest.
