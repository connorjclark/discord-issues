I don't know how long it's been this way, but if you look at the "Piece #" box, it's partially blocking the other check boxes there.

oh for fucks
this dialog is the worst thing in existence
it legitimately scares me to edit it in any way
and it really just needs to be completely remade....

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 07/27/2022 11:34

Sorry...   Not important I guess.

No, that's an "I really need to get my ass on remaking that", legitimately
Not the whole editor, just the properties dialog
I remade the Init Data dialog, which was almost as crazy
those are the 2 dialogs that are just weird in how they work
the big thing here being, it changes based on the object type you're editing
which should REALLY be not that bad to do in the new dialog system, I just, need to get my ass on it
And some of the procs, like the color selector one, need to be remade in the new system
so, it's not a one-day project, but really does need to be on my todo list

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅(Subscreen Editor) - Triforce Piece number box should be repositioned.
(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Sorry...   Not important I gu…"): Important enough that I just finished rewriting the entire properties dialog.
