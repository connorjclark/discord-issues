As the title implies ZQuest hard crashes and closes when I attempt to compile the master script in my quest via zscript. I even tried the JIT compile options and Zquest still hard crashes and close when I attempt to compile my master script for the questm and yes I have updated to the newest nightly build

JIT is for the player, not compilation of scripts in editor FYI

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/25/2023 19:54

So any insight into my issue?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2023 22:59

so, firstly, your script doesn't compile
1. you used `[-] Current Projects\(-) Myriad Worlds\` directly in your import statements, but you didn't include such directories for us.
2. You did not include `LinkMovement.zh`
For the record, you can do something like this:

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2023 23:15

and secondly @ FireSeraphim
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1144715199857840178/1144771971595370617/image.png?ex=65eb9bfa&is=65d926fa&hm=3997d5f67818d0f03f7fefeead7248e76d8f7f586d8252a8fdbb7956143aa7a2&)
once I fix the scripts not compiling, it compiles fine
no crash

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/25/2023 23:54

the hell?
can you send me your corrected copy of my masterscript?

I just changed the includepath thing, that wouldn't affect it crashing or anything

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/26/2023 00:05

Nope, still crashed on my end

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 00:05

are you using 32 bit or 64 bit

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/26/2023 00:05

64 bit version of the latest build

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/26/2023 15:41

Nope, still crashes in nightly-2023-08-26-2

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/26/2023 21:45

nope, still crashes in the new nightly that just released

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 21:46

no one said they fixed it lol
(replying to @ FireSeraphim "nope, still crashes in the ne…"): does anything in the latest nightly's changelog mention fixing compile crashes? If not, then you don't need to keep saying it lol
me fixing a typo in the VSCode Extension is not going to fix ZQuest crashing lol

=== @ tim 08/30/2023 17:58

@ FireSeraphim can you confirm the same allegro log output as previous

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/30/2023 17:59

gimme a minute

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/30/2023 18:01

fresh log from an attempt I did just now to try and compile the master script

=== @ tim 08/30/2023 18:02

can you pop a search into C:\Windows\System32 for that file
shcore.dll

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/30/2023 18:03

That explains it. I'm using windows 7 still

=== @ tim 08/30/2023 18:04

this is strange because

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/30/2023 18:04

and windows 7 does not have shcore.dll by default

=== @ tim 08/30/2023 18:04

allegro 5 looks for this
and we've been using 5 since
a while now

=== @ tim 08/30/2023 18:08

scale factor for monitor
<:thunkong:423728456560410625>

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/30/2023 18:10

fixing the issue on my end now.
_cross fingers and hopes the somewhat sketchy video guide to fixing the shcore.dll issue doesn't backfire in my face._

=== @ tim 08/30/2023 18:11

if for some reason it calls something else not on w7

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/30/2023 18:11

I'm running chkdsk right now

=== @ tim 08/30/2023 18:14

not something i'd normally follow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 22:00

Fixed now.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/03/2023 01:14

Nope
still happening on my end
and I been trying to deal with support files issues on my end to no avail
newly genned allegro.log from just now when I attempted to compile

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2023 01:16

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "still happening on my end"): I didn't release a build yet
since I said that

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/03/2023 01:16

I see...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2023 01:16

it will be fixed, Mani confirmed it, and was having the same issue so

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/03/2023 01:17

I saw the new nightly and made an erroneous assumption in connection to what you said

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2023 01:17

aye, that was before what I said

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/04/2023 11:37

It works now. You can now close this report
