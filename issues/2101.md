Dear devs,
It'd be really neat if I could get and set the current MIDI position of the currently playing MIDI.
I would use it for seamlessly transitioning variations of the same tune in different areas.
If it isn't possible, it isn't a huge deal. But I think it'd be a nice little feature

By position, do you mean the index of the midi song events; or time?

Hi Connor,
I think it's the  index that I am referring to, not the actual time, but that stuff you can also configure to start/loop the MIDI

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/27/2022 08:55

so, the current playback time index, and the read/write access to the configured start/loopstart/loopend points?

And, you'd need write access to the playback index, so a seek function
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) knows some music stuff

It's been a hot minute and my extent was just making a copy of an existing function; I don't know much music stuff

"so, the current playback time index"
Yes indeed

"and the read/write access to the configured start/loopstart/loopend points?"
That wouldn't be necessary, but I suppose that'd be useful

"And, you'd need write access to the playback index, so a seek function"
Yes I'd also need write access üôÇ

Anyway, my gratitude so far for checking it out!

`zc_midi_seek(int)` and allegro's `midi_pos` are what would be used.
