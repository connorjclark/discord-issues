Adding to this bug report that not only is the shield functional, but the player can also use their sword while carrying things if the throw button is set to B.

new flags for the lift glove item
`Disable Shield` being checked makes it treat your shield the same way it does when you are swinging a sword or etc while lifting
`Disable Item Use` prevents using any non-lift-related items while holding something

(lift-related items currently includes:
-Lift Gloves, obviously
-Bombs / SBombs with the `Auto-Lift` flag checked
and, using any lift-related item while holding something, throws it. For non-lift-glove items, this uses your highest level lift glove for the throw stats.)
so, basically, you can leave these unchecked for how it works now, or check them to make lifting more restrictive.
Will need someone to test these out in the next nightly.

by the way, can you also please test what happens if you try swimming while holding an item (or if you get warped onto water while holding an item)

=== @ P-Tux7 05/30/2023 05:03

and pitfalls for that matter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/30/2023 14:24

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "by the way, can you also plea…"): should just drop the item
that shouldn't be new
