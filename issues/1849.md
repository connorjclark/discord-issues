Idea is to have a drawing mode where instead of placing one selected combo, it places random combos selected from a pool. The pool would use the Favorite Combos portion of the screen and be accessed through the tools dropdown, something like "Edit Combo Pool".

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2022 06:08

The Favorite Combos menu would then change to "Combo Pool" and have a different set of combos in it and two extra buttons: One to clear the pool, one to close out of pool mode and bring back favorite combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 06:10

yes ❤️

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2022 06:13

While in pool mode, all combo drawing (paint, fill, replace) would use a random combo from the pool, ignoring empty squares. Placing a combo in the pool multiple times would made it more likely to be selected. Also ideally the pool menu would respect the selected csets of added combos. So you could place the same tree combo but in randomized csets. And you could use brush width to place random 2x2 trees

=== @ Alucard648 09/10/2022 10:17

I don`t like the way to use Favorite Combos for building Combo Pools, as most questmakers used Favorite Combos for most commonly used combos, like dungeon design elements, and as bookmarks for using "Scroll to Combo" to quickly access combos across super huge combo table. Better use new data, like Combo Alias Mode.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/10/2022 11:05

Reminds me a little of this discussion.

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2022 12:23

(replying to @ Alucard648 "I don`t like the way to use F…"): Maybe I was unclear, it doesn't replace favorite combos, it's a temporary editing mode that uses the favorite combos field for storing combo pool data. The reason I recommended it is it's a rarely used part of the editor that you can still see while scrolling through the combo table and viewing the screen. It also already has a layout that supports adding and removing combos, and you're unlikely to need both it and combo pool mode at the same time because combos you want to randomize from are likely to be in close proximity in the combo table. As soon as you hit the close button or the dropdown again, all your favorite combos would be back where you left them

@ Moosh BWAHAHAHAHAHAH

I decided not to make it have a separate clear/revert/etc
instead, it is just a drawing mode, that you can access by clicking the normal drawing mode button at the top-right; it's just after aliases
Also, `Favorite Combos` text now reads `Favorite Aliases` in alias mode
You might also notice the `Combo Pool Mode` favorite command
....one of those exists for every drawing mode, actually
Though I updated them to now show as 'indented' when that drawing mode is active.

You can now R-Click the draw mode button to pop up a selection menu
for convenience

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 16:38

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Clicking the X:"): ...currently adding this X to just be there for all modes, to let you clear out your favorite combos easily if you want that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 16:47

... <:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>
Despite that this is all really cool, I still feel like it's lacking
What it REALLY needs is a full UI rework to work kinda like aliases do, with its' own 'pool editor' and the ability to save them.
But that's waaay more work, and this works nicely for now at least....

=== @ Alucard648 09/10/2022 16:55

I wish it will be possible to save combo pools in quest file.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 16:55

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "What it REALLY needs is a ful…"): ^
when I have the energy to do a whole-ass UI workup including a new dialog and new combo scroll list code, I'll add that

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/10/2022 17:15

Amazing!  Thanks very much!  This will be pretty interesting to play around with.  Time to add _so many random stupid flowers_ to the world for no reason.
All of the flowers.  All of the time.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 20:27

OK OK OK

woo
Looks awesome, yeah?
Only 2 major problems: Still not saving to the quest file, and uh, there's *no way to edit them*, I just hardcoded in that one for the screenshot. GUI to edit them is next up, then saving code.

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2022 21:44

Is saving combo pools to the file necessary? Takes just a few seconds to set one up with the method I suggested. This new one does seem it'll allow saving but also make the process slower
Unless you did something fucked like having the left column display pools but the two right ones still draw combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 21:51

(replying to @ Moosh "Is saving combo pools to the…"): Saving allows, say, including them in tilesets
(replying to @ Moosh "Unless you did something fuck…"): No, editing the pools will be a dialog
Unless you meant like
Being able to use either pools or normal combos uhggg
That sounds painful

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2022 21:52

Oh sure and reusing them in general. Just thinking about the click cost long term

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 21:53

Favorite command for pool mode will be one of my new additions to my commands
Because it's very useful

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2022 21:53

Having to right click the pool, select edit, then place down combos then close it, then use it. If you use the same pools a lot it'll be a big save long term.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 21:54

You won't need to select edit
Right clicking just opens the edit window, same as aliases
No rclick menu

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2022 21:55

Ah good

The preview here shows the weighted or unweighted contents of the combo pool
Weighted means that the same combo being in it 10 times shows 10 times, while unweighted only shows each instance
It automatically toggles between weighted and unweighted preview every few seconds
If the pool has more than can fit, it just won't show what can't fit
which is why unweighted might be helpful, as it's harder to fill that up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 23:52

Also, how do you like the X's? I adjusted them slightly...

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:23

Is there a way to add multiple combos to the pool at a time? Like open the combo table, click, click, click, click, click done?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:23

No

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:23

Alas

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:24

Though, you can `Alt+Click` a combo thing to place the currently 'selected' combo to that

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:24

I'm really thinking I preferred the original janky setup UI wise, but having the feature at all is what matters

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:24

and `Ctrl+Click` to *grab* the combo from one to place on others with alt
so you can kinda copy/paste them around
(need to add infotext for that)

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:25

Getting flashbacks of the alias editor here which I find very tedious to use

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:25

This shouldn't be anywhere near as bad as the alias editor
it's built to try to be smooth

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:26

When you press add, does it auto open the combo selector and remember what page you're on?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:27

No, I'm not sure how I would make it do that

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:27

That's save a click, a mouse motion, and several pg downs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:28

probably would be good to do, just need to dig into some other code to figure out how
the combo selector / tile selector pages are a very VERY old dialog
older than the old dialogs

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:28

yeahhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:28

they are more similar to the main screen than a dialog popup

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:28

Sorry if I'm coming off as overly nitpicky or negative here, that's not my intent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:29

no, no, I like the feedback

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:30

I think this works as a UI if the process can be simplified to four mouse actions. Move, click, move, click. That's basically the same number as the first draft

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:31

I think I'll be able to do it, it'll just take a bit more time.
Keep in mind that unlike the first draft, adding duplicates can be done by *typing in a number*
as well as +/- buttons that go in 1,10,100 increments

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:32

Thanks for going to all this extra effort to implement this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:32

so, you need a lot less clicks really, since you don't need to add duplicates

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:34

Also, the `Use CSet` checkbox- if it isn't checked, the combo will be placed in the current cset (as normal for combo placement). If it IS checked, it will always be placed in the specified cset.

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:34

What's the max pool size? Seems bigger than Planets' which is a laughable 5 (still very functional despite this)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:34

uhhhh
well the max weight for a single combo is 65535

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:34

yeahh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:34

and the max number of combos is "until it crashes"?

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:35

lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:35

It uses a vector of data, so, free-resizing
each entry in the vector has a combo ID, cset (from -1 to 11, where `-1` indicates the `Use CSet` is unchecked), and quantity (`0` to `65535`)
I, uh, haven't made it save to the quest file yet. That's last.

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:37

Dare I ask how many pools it can save? I would've left it at one combo page's worth but with ZC I'd be wholly unsurprised by 65535

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:38

8192
same as aliases

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:38

Ah okay. So a reasonable limit
Still way more than anybody will ever need. Same as aliases

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:38

I copied the alias graphical code for the scrollers *exactly*, so I wanted the same number
less work

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:39

sensible

That is a button that toggles between weighted/unweighted preview

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:40

Now that's nifty. Glad you kept this preview

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:40

the unweighted preview shows each combo, no duplicates
weighted shows the duplication
if it doesn't have room for enough of them, it just stops at the size

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:41

If you have more than 52 combos in a pool even with weighting, probably doing something wrong
"I want an exact 65535:65534 distribution!"

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:43

And by jove you can do that...assuming multiple very large pools don't cause problems for the math. I assume not if it's long

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:43

If the total weight goes over 2.14 billion you'll have a big problem
....hmm, should add a sanity check to make sure that doesn't crash.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:44

that would, literally, for the record, be every single combo at 65535 weight
(....though, you can duplicate each combo up to 12 times due to cset, so you can get 12 times above that)

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:45

If somebody has the patience to add 32655 combos to the pool, let it crash 🤣

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:46

oh, wait, it would take twice as much to crash
because it unsigns the result of the rand call
though, it would only be picking from the latter half of the pool at that point?

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:46

I assume it's using ranges and not putting every combo in an array

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:46

oh, and it might read out of bounds on the FRONT end
it's using weight ranges
so
Every combo is basically already IN an array, that's how the data is stored

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:47

Because on a smaller system I'd probably do the latter to circumvent basic math

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:47

what it does is
let's say I have 3 combos, A, B, and C
with weights 1, 1, and 8
it'll do `zc_rand(1+1+8-1)`
so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:49

```cpp
int result = zc_rand(9); //0 to 9 inclusive
int weight = 0;
for(each combo)
{
    weight += combo.weight;
    if(result < weight) return combo;
}```
roughly
...in full, it's ```cpp
cpool_entry const* combo_pool::get_w(size_t weight_index) const
{
    if(!combos.size())
        return nullptr;
    auto curweight = 0;
    for(cpool_entry const& cp : combos)
    {
        curweight += cp.quant;
        if(weight_index < curweight)
            return &cp;
    }
    return nullptr; //Error?
}
cpool_entry const* combo_pool::pick() const
{
    return get_w(zc_rand(totalweight-1));
}```

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:50

yeah that sounds like how I've done it in the past

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:50

the for should always return
as the random number should be in the range of entries, always
the problem here is if anything gets negative in the random number generator part
then it could generate too big a number
so I just need to guard against that

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 12:52

Assume you wouldn't want it attempting this on a size 0 pool either

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:54

...yep, though it stops you from placing if the pool has no valid entries
that was an obvious one to think of

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 12:59

should be all sanity-checked now
if the total weight is `< 1`, it immediately returns the error value before even doing the rand call
(rand call is `totalweight-1`, so, `<1` would be negative rand)

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:00

Oh! Another thing comes to mind. Does the Use CSet box default to unchecked? Seems to in the example images

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:00

aye
which, when unchecked, means it uses the normal selected cset

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:00

I think it's slightly more likely to want the cset preserved than not, so maybe that should be default

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:00

really?

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:01

Yeah, there's not a lot of combos you'd want to randomize but draw in multiple csets

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:01

...exactly?

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:01

no no, other way around

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:02

I suppose it would depend on your tileset

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:02

I might wanna randomize the csets of some trees or detailings, but typically all my grass will be green, all my dungeon blocks will use the same cset between every dungeon

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:03

....can you not just be in that cset when you place them then, like you would normally?
If the box is unchecked, it just uses the cset you are placing in

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:03

right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:04

so if I'm placing blocks in the dungeon, I'll probably be placing in that cset, so why should I need to have it preserve the cset?

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:04

A lot of cases work for both, but most importantly they work for the option that requires the most effort

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:05

If it starts checked, you need to select the correct cset when selecting the combo; if not, you only need to select the correct cset when placing the combo like you normally do when placing any combos on the screen

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:05

If you're using multiple csets, the user is already doing extra actions to change the cset, on top of hitting the checkbox

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:05

....exactly?

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:05

Whereas the alternative you only have to set the cset once
Then it remembers for every combo you add after

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:06

. . . ?
I'm confused and I don't know if you aren't making sense if or I'm just that stoned
I feel like you aren't making sense

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:07

Maybe a bit of both
Say I want to add 3 combos in the same cset

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:07

The question is not if you want to add them in the same cset
the question is if you want the cset you add them in to matter AT ALL

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:07

I open the combo table for the first one, scroll to the combo page and cset, select a combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:08

If you have the checkbox unchecked, you do not need to select the correct cset in the combo selector

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:08

For the next two, I only need to select a combo. Not the page and cset

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:08

what does that have to do with the checkbox for cset being checked or not

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:09

wait I'm tripping 🤦

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:09

that just sounds like a general suggestion that is entirely separate
(replying to @ Moosh "Oh! Another thing comes to mi…"): ^ this is what started the discussion
It does default to unchecked
which means
that the cset you select when selecting the combo is *not even saved* because the cset it saves is just `-1`
and it will use the brush cset when placing the pool

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:10

Yeah. My thought process there was that when I want to select from multiple csets, I need to perform extra actions per cset added

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:10

If it is checked, then you need to select the proper cset when setting up the pool, and it will ALWAYS place in that cset regardless
If you want to use the brush cset, you need to do less work, not more
which is why I made that the default
checked is only really useful if you want to have different csets

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:11

So I'd want the checkbox to default to that to save one action per combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:11

ex. if I want to have randomly some cset 2 and some cset 3 grass in the same pool
then I would want to specify that
so unless you are specifically doing that, you don't really have a reason to check the checkbox
so, not that many actions
also btw

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:12

And this is what I was overlooking. It's not all or nothing. The checkbox is a checkbox
oh dang, small mode compatible
<a:hugheart:876927396215930930>

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:14

That does not use separate large/small code, except for a couple numbers
(namely, the number of columns before it adds new rows, and the number of rows before it adds a scrollpane)
For the record, the way this works, is based off something I did for backend reasons a bit ago
We were having issues with the thing I did to stop dialog flickering, and it was causing crashes
so we had to just redesign some stuff to be smarter
and, what I ended up doing is making it a hell of a lot easier to completely restart a dialog without it flickering

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:16

I did recognize those fancy scrollbars

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:16

so, what it does here is
it stores the combo pool data in a global variable
then, it generates the dialog
Every time you click the `<`,`>`,`X`,`Tidy`,`Paste` buttons
it does the change that that button does, and then *regenerates the entire dialog*

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:17

nifty

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:17

which allows it to easily have conditional shifts, like whether to scroll or not, and resize the entire window
Clicking `Copy` copies the current data in the UI to a global, which just sits there
and `Paste` will then paste that data back in and reload
since there's no r-click menu on the pools, figured adding the copy-paste in the dialog would work nicely

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:19

Makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:21

Oh, also, want to know something fun?
When you left click to place a combo normally, you know how you can click and drag to draw around, right?
Well, fun fact, it *drew the combo again every single frame that you held click on the same position*!
....for pools, that meant rapidly flickering between random combos
Solved fairly simply, though
just, keep track of the last position the draw drew to, and don't draw to that position again, so it only draws when the pos changes

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:23

Sounds like a mild performance boost as well if it's not performing those calculations every frame

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:24

aye, should be

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:24

Recall combo drawing felt kinda laggy in older versions, not doubt a combination of old screen refresh methods, ancient allegro jank, and this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:24

`frame` here used loosly, as it's not actually *the frame rate*, it's just the logic loop
which actually runs separately to the visual FPS thanks to A5 threaded shit

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:26

has nothing on lists though, I have yet to see ZQuest perform software gore worse than 1.92's lists

And YES I took the time to make it look decent in small mode.... <:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>
it does only have 12 combos of preview space, so not that useful
but, that's what you get for cramped ui

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:57

(Unweighted mode will definitely be more useful for small mode)

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:58

You say not that useful, the feature that inspired tgis had five slots _total_ including dupes 😛

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:58

oh for fucks
wow

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 13:59

yeah, very bare minimum but still immensely useful

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 13:59

Now all I have left to do is the save file shit
....god forbid people want script access to these as random combo set pickers
(...they will, and that would be smart, but not fucking now lol)
Also, side effect of laziness, you can hit the copy button, load another quest, and it stays on the clipboard for these

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2022 14:00

Oh yeah hell naw. There's already plenty of substitutes for a similar data structure
like for example...a screen

=== @ Russ 09/11/2022 14:01

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/11/2022 14:18

Emily, you're the best. ❤️  Thank you so much for this wonderful feature.
I am going to enthuse about my inherent dumbness for a moment and inquire as to what the difference between weighted and unweighted items in the pool are.
When I think "weighted" I think of item drop chance percentages.
But not seeing any actual percentile value in the pool, that notion gets dashed out the window immediately, though I'm still left with the words.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 14:20

So, the weighted/unweighted does not change anything about how they work
it just refers to the preview
The unweighted preview shows each combo only once
The weighted preview shows the combos as per their weight

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1018039918913663058/1018526704207151164/unknown.png?ex=65e48769&is=65d21269&hm=9151801c5dd66c16172357fb07ded3cb03192005a9481191dfffc867867584fb&)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/11/2022 14:21

Interesting.  My sleepy-butt can't think of a way that that's useful at the moment, but I can't wait to find out why.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 14:21

Well, here's a good simple idea
imagine you're using really big weight numbers
The weighted preview will probably run out of space and only fit some of the pool

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/11/2022 14:22

"Weight" being the amount of Combos that a combo can randomize?  Or...?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 14:22

the unweighted preview will not duplicate any combos, so it can fit far more
No, so

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1018039918913663058/1018527075482730627/unknown.png?ex=65e487c2&is=65d212c2&hm=e9d8a554d244b4e53c704e81bc4d23baff191cb9f35928903e2fe9edadcb51e3&)
Here's an example
This pool has 3 combos
The big grass has 1 weight
the dotted grass has 3 weight
the plain ground has 6 weight
so, 1+3+6 = 10
the big grass has 1/10 chance of being placed
the dotted grass has 3/10
and the plain ground has 6/10

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/11/2022 14:24

Mm, beautifully explained.  Thank you! 👍

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 14:24

Filling a screen with that pattern would look something like so:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1018039918913663058/1018527402361622528/unknown.png?ex=65e48810&is=65d21310&hm=f268ce5a56b34ab5434ec752632b290458cf7d8cd57c87a7c20cd8def802116b&)
1/10th big grass, 3/10 dotted grass, 6/10 normal ground. Seems about right?
Then, the weighted/unweighted preview

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1018039918913663058/1018527621761470534/unknown.png?ex=65e48844&is=65d21344&hm=e2a06da62e1c2d2ed7cd37bc8c01db0a8d3364d7b9de66d5b9628121e959c748&)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/11/2022 14:25

I have far, far more faith in code than I do in random chance.  I'm a big believer in Dilbert's "Random number generator" theorum.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 14:25

So on the weighted preview, you can see at a glance how much grass there is compared to plain ground
On the unweighted, you can only see what combos are used, not their weights
but that can fit a lot more
Here this uses 10 combos on the weighted preview
Small mode only has space for *12 combos* on it's preview, soooo

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/11/2022 14:26

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "On the unweighted, you can on…"): This sentence right here is _perfect_ for an explanation.
If anyone else asks for one, I mean.  A definitively effective summary.

Knowing many quest authors, people are doing to immediately fill these Combo pools with all of their assorted grass flowers and such and just flood-fill the screen with it on layer 1 or something.

Just include a combo 0 for the empty if you're using it on a layer
should work fine

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/11/2022 14:29

Yeah, it's why I'm so amazed and pleased with the way it turned out.  This was a really great implementation.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2022 14:29

the weight goes up to 65535 per combo
