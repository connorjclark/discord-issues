No this has nothing to do with blocks! This isn't strictly necessary since there's all sorts of collision and tile checking functions exposed via ZScript, but it could be an alternative option for simpler collision handling. 

PushX(int)/PushY(int) - Queue up an event that moves the specified entity (player, enemy, ffc, whatever) the specified distance in the X or Y axes, to be handled in-engine, taking into account any applicable built-in collision mechanics for the given type of object.

Basically this could be an alternative to directly modifying an entity's position. Imagine using a shotgun type weapon that causes the player to recoil backwards by half a combo or whatever. Instead of handling all the required collision or combo interaction stuff in the script itself you just call PushX/PushY to move the player in whatever direction you want, the movement will be applied in the player movement functions and it'll handle all the dirty work for you.

Again, this type of thing can already be implemented at the script level, but I think having a way to "move" an object under the rules of the engine as opposed to just "changing the position" of an object is cleaner from a design sense, especially as the in-engine behavior space continues to expand down the line.

For the record, we have MoveXY for enemies and players
which basically lets you move the player and enemies in a way that still lets them obey solidity
using the engine solidity checks
is that basically what you're asking for?
I don't know off the top of my head if we have it for items, ffc, or weapons
having a cleaner way to do it for things that aren't enemies/the player without havign to make a dummy enemy and move it makes sense though

Yeah that sounds about what I'm asking for, though it wouldn't be JUST for solidity
Like if you recoil into a liquid combo you'd fall into the water and respawn the same as if you walked into it
for example

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2023 04:41

I think liquid no longer only activates when walking now
if you have the newer liquid collision on it always passively checks if you're on it

ah I see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 05:43

yeah
enemy MoveXY has plenty of checks
including enemy flags that let them walk on water/over pits/etc
(or ONLY on water, not on normal ground, etc)

(meta) thread name was changed: all sprite movexy
