1. Open Tile warp or Side warp editor.
2. Set warp type to anything other than Cave/ItemCellar.
3. Click on minimap in attempt to set the warp screen.
Expected result: warp screen sholuld be set to position clicked on minimap.
Actual result: nothing happens.

@ Alucard648 does it work in `Quest->Misc Data->Warp Rings->Edit->Edit`?
...oh
oh
no
no it doesn
well fuck
this is bad
that just crashed

=== @ Alucard648 11/26/2023 18:20

Same thing. Crash confirmed.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 18:20

aha I understand why though
this is a piece of shit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 21:09

OK, hear me out
time for an overhaul?

=== @ Alucard648 11/26/2023 21:10

Oh yes. üëç

This is the *warp ring* dialog
not the main tile/sidewarp one
(so, I haven't *removed* anything here, this is just everything that's normally in this one; I still have to redesign the others)
but, instead of clicking on the minimap, you now have a grid

and it like, shows rooms marked on the dmap
and it updates the green square if you type in the box as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 21:15

(the hitbox for clicking on the small map was always kinda off; the new grid should be cleaner hitbox)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 21:17

...also what are the thoughts on removing the tabs from the tile/sidewarp, and just having 4 buttons A-D instead?

=== @ Alucard648 11/26/2023 21:21

Both tabs and buttons are OK.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 21:28

The fun thing is, buttons means I can use 4 times *less* widgets
by just having the buttons reload the same widgets for all 4

=== @ Alucard648 11/26/2023 21:33

And this would make it possible at add ExWarps or something?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/26/2023 21:41

err
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
this would make the dialog look nicer and be cleaner code

=== @ Alucard648 11/26/2023 21:55

Still good to hear.
