When resizing an enemy that is already bigger than 1x1 in-engine (like Aquamentus), something isn't adding up to the number box value internally. E.x. when I make Aquamentus 2x3 instead of 2x2, the size respects 2x3, but the tiles drawn will use 2 for the Y skips. So if you check the size boxes, and put in 1x1, it will draw Aquamentus correctly

Does this include scripted resizing?
