My first idea is some kind of ability to rearrange Dmap numbers, if you create your Overworld on map 4 for example, this ability would let you toggle Map 4 back to being map 1 again, without deleting and re-pasting maps in order to achieve this. All exits and stairs created won't becomes mixed up or erased while doing this.  Notice:  >   If this is not possible, i would like the ability to rearrange Dmaps without Exits and Stairs getting mixed up or messed up by trying to sort around my Dmaps by copying and re-pasting them. The idea would be a toggle option so transport destinations don't get ruined.

This is one thing that has always bugged me.

and could be avoided by careful planning

Ok then, just a sort button for Dmaps then maybe?
But the data is unchanged, it just appears different in the editor
