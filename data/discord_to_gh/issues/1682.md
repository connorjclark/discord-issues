So
basically the idea is to have optional function parameters like in C++
so like
say

this which I have already working

...don't think it's type checking that the default value is the right type, though, still need to handle that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/12/2022 19:35

neat. are you also ensuring that no non-optional params can follow an optional one?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/12/2022 19:35

aye, that should be handled at the bison level
it constructs the param lists starting at the end, taking either a normal or optional param
but once it finds a non-optional param, it should no longer accept any more optional ones

neat ü¶¨

k, it's now properly erroring on mismatched types
also, errors are no longer printing out 4 times per error

```cpp
////////////////////////////////
//  Function Optional Params  //
////////////////////////////////

You may now have optional parameters in functions.
    [example--
    void foo(int x = 25)
    {
        Trace(x*2);
    }
    foo(); //Traces '50'
    foo(10); //Traces '20'
    --end example]

Optional parameters cannot have any non-optional parameters listed after them.
The default value for an optional parameter must be compile-time constant.```

oooh

I legit thought this would take me like days or something
but I had the idea in my head with an itch to work
....and it just.... fell into place
Also, while I was at it, I added another optimization
If you call a function with a constant value as a param, it now is more efficient
e.g. `foo(5)` now does:
`PUSHV 50000`
instead of:
`SETV d2,50000`
`PUSHR d2`
"defaulted parameters" likewise use a single PUSHV for each param
minor stuff, but, can add up in larger scripts
and, well, using optional params instead of having another function with one less param to call it... is a LOT more optimized

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/12/2022 20:31

e.g. ```cpp
void foo(int x = 25)
    Trace(x);
foo(); //calls 'foo(25)', one function call```vs```cpp
void foo(int x)
    Trace(x);
void foo()
    foo(25);
foo(); //calls 'foo()', which then calls 'foo(25), 2 function calls, double the function overhead```
can end up saving about `4 + (3*prevParams)` opcodes, I think?
which is to say, for one optional param omitted, and no other params, it saves about 4 opcodes
but if it had one optional param omitted, with one NON-optional param (or optional param that was not omitted) before it
it would save `4 + (3*1)` opcodes
2 params before would be `4 + (3*2)`
....but if you had 2 params before, and also 2 optional params omitted
it saves `4 + (3*2)` for the first function call, and then ANOTHER `4 + (3*3)` for the next
if you stacked the calls
if you didn't stack them, it would still just save `4 + (3*2)`
...but regardless, the new option is far more efficient than any way you could possibly have done this before

If anyone wants to play with this, here's a build (including updated std_zh stuff)
it's pushed/merged and done
