I had two thoughts which inspire this idea.

1)  A string that can play when you either HAVE, or DO NOT HAVE, the required item to unlock a chest.

2)  If you do not have the required item, its "Next" combo is different than the "I have unlocked this combo" combo.

The situation is, I had the idea for making a lockblock combo into an invisible space where a guard is standing next to.  All you have to do is hold _up_ (As the lockblock's trigger mechanism.) to trigger it, as if you were walking past the guard with a required item.

Depending on whether or not you have the item required determines what it will do.

If you have the item, the combo EITHER plays a string to acknowledge that you've successfully triggered the item, OR it turns _into_ a combo that is able to play a specific string.

So there would need to be a chest/lockblock combo that can either play one of two strings, situation dependant, -or- it can turn into two different combos depending on whether you have the item or not, each of which plays one string.

Not quite sure which is better, really.   What do you think would be better for something like this, if it's not just outright a script.
