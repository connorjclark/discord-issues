Bombs are broken when starting a new quest or Authentic NES Quest. This is latest Alpha.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 00:06

Broken how?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:07

Create a New Zelda quest
and try to give them to yourself.
by cheat.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:11

.... Could you actually report the bug that you are reporting?
This is useless
@ SkyLizardGirl

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 00:12

I just found bombs in 1st.qst from a black moblin and used them, and they worked fine.
Now to find a bombable wall with it and try it there.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:12

I wouldn't bother testing on this vague a report

Works fine.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:12

Ok i see it was just updated an hour later
i will check if its fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:13

.... What was the issue in the first place?
Nothing relating to bombs changed in that update
Can you please actually tell us anything about the issue?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:15

Ok the error is still there
Give yourself Bombs in cheat after starting a new fresh quest.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:16

.....

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 00:16

I don't even have access to the cheat menu in the "Authentic" 1st.qst

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:16

WHAT IS THE ISSUE
What cheat, what quest
bombs where
doing what wrong
without any details we can't do a SINGLE THING
This report will just end up being closed and ignored without information

Do this

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 00:17

@ SkyLizardGirl - Please describe what happens during or after giving yourself bombs.
Also describe what "authentic means."
Oh okay, I'll replicate that...
Also, this is important:

then this

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 00:17

Past that "About ZC" box on the bottom with each bug you post, please.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:17

Then see
Then see if you have bombs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:18

. . .

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:18

Start a new quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:18

SLG
Did you give yourself any bomb AMMO?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:18

then give yourself bombs in the test quest
.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:18

Giving yourself the bomb item means you have bombs in your inventory
....but does not give you *ammo to use them*
so, no, they would not appear

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:19

Yes
i gave myself ammo
they are not appearing

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 00:19

This is what you start with in a new quest.  No bomb max.

Works fine for me
you didn't give yourself ammo
(And if you claim you did, please *show those steps*, as you did not show that)

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:22

I gave myself the bombs in init
there is still a weird bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:22

How did you give yourself the bombs
specfiically
because doing everything you said to do
it works fine for me
so you have done something wrong

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:23

I even defaulted the bombs to see.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:23

. . .

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:23

By the cheat

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:23

can you answer my question

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:24

in Test play

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:24

What cheat
exactly

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:24

In Test play

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:24

Also i put it as an item on the field and it bugs out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:25

.....
what the heck

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:25

when i get the bomb.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:25

This issue does not happen for me
at all
in any way
if you can't give me specific and EXACT steps to reproduce the issue I can't do a damn thing to help

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:27

Ok now its working the bombs are working but, it's stuck on infinite bombs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:28

. . . what did you change
I can't help if you tell me nothing

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:28

Hold on let me get pics

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:28

......?????????????????
This is not a `New` quest

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:29

It's stuck on infinite even though the bombs are normal

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:29

which is what you said before

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:29

i tested on a fresh quest also

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:29

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>
You probably have your subscreen fucked up
the `Infinite Item` for the bomb counter is probably set to an item that you have given the player
which would not be the case in a `New` quest
Unless you have given the player the `Bomb Bag 4` item in the `New` quest
or otherwise modified the subscreen
in which case you have blatantly given false information in this report

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:34

Ok now it is unlocked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:35

Start from the BEGINNING.
First step: You click `File->New`.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:35

I am i am posting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:35

What next.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:35

every picture before i text

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053462934287814677/1053470417869869097/image.png?ex=65ebaec8&is=65d939c8&hm=525a41a60b6d36e90795766988531dae4da19ad792fbd7510786380d97baa1b5&)
That's set next
then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:35

that's not the beginning
go back to `File->New` and start from there
I don't know what you've already done to this quest file

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/17/2022 00:35


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053462934287814677/1053470542436507698/image.png?ex=65ebaee5&is=65d939e5&hm=e6357513cd9fa950e8bedafa6e06ebd2b6501c5e6085e2caf020b767dc2541db&)
Ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 00:35

so you showing stuff here without showing what you've done before does not help at all
because you could have done any number of things to fuck it up

Here is a new file again
