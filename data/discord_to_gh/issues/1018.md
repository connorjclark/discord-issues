ZC has some sort of limitation that makes it so a second fairly will not spawn* if there is a second fairy onscreen, even with a 100% item drop rate for just a fairy (moving; haven't tried stationary). 

 (* - _Usually, inconsistently_. Sometimes I could only get one to spawn, sometimes a second one would appear, but definitely not more than 2).

This may be a deliberate bit of code to try to simulate some sort of NES limitation (though it's not even accurate at that because you can have at least two fairies in Zelda 1), but it doesn't make sense / might warrant some kind of QR change or something. 

~~(Why do I have a feeling this is one of those "a previous dev had a hard-on for difficulty" bits of code, like the thing about not letting people use that one cheats program....)~~

However, spawning at least 3 fairies with FFC scripts works normally as expected, thankfully. So this is just something about how they work as item drops.

Was discussed here (found by P-Tux): https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/887461043117391872/887550177739694102

Note: This isn't a new bug, and I haven't confirmed it still works this way in 2.55 (though I would think P-Tux would know if it didn't?). Only tested it in 2.50.2 linux myself.

i think zelda 1 has a 1 fairy limit - if a fairy is on-screen, no enemies will drop fairies until that one is gone
and the other fairies spawning are when two fairy-spawning enemies are killed on the same frame, meaning that both checks for a fairy on-screen fail
it takes some careful practice or luck to perform, which is probably why phantom menace thought that 1 fairy was the limit

I suppose it makes some sense but it'd be nice to have the option to disable it for modern quests, at least.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2021 19:07

probably something to do with the fact that fairies are both an enemy and an item

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 17:04

this is pain
fairies are hardcoded
this is a feature request to surpass ~~metal gear~~ sideview swimming

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 19:13

Fixed; also have a new QR as well to let fairies spawn with different directions cause that annoyed me
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíFairy spawn limitations
@ Mitsukara the real reason this was implemented the way it was was because the item just grabbed the first fairy enemy on screen to attach itself to it
so I had to rewrite how fairies worked to let multiple exist

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 19:58

Why are fairies enemies?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 19:59

because moving

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 19:59

I understand they're Guys but enemy Goriyas and Guy Goriyas are different
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "because moving"): I'd have thought they would be an LWeapon in that case

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 19:59

guy fairies and item fairies are differnet too
lweapons don't have movement behaviors other than straight line

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:00

boomerangs?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 20:00

that's straight line, and when it dies, straight line
to add proper movement behaviors and the variables to store that it'd need to be a subclass of weapon
which would be annoying
as all `lweapon`/`eweapon` are a single class, no subclasses

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:01

okay so what did dimi turn the fairies into now?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 20:01

nothing changed
it's just that it no longer just grabs the first fairy enemy on screen for every fairy
it actually makes separate ones for each

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:09

well that's going in the lttp tileset
always-spawn-fairy combos like in the eastern palace pots

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:45

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "always-spawn-fairy combos lik‚Ä¶"): they also no longer default to facing up with a new QR
that annoyed me when I made lttp-styled fairy fountains in HF

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:47

wait how'd you do it if more than one fairy couldn't exist

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:48

literally had to rewrite the system to give each fairy item a value that stores it's enemy counterpart

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:48

no i meant in HF

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:48

See here's the weird thing
the limitation for some reason doesn't exist for scripts
and I don't know why

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:48

that *works*?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:48

yeah
but the code seemed to suggest that it wouldn't

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2021 20:49

i'd have thought zc would just start crying if ordered to make multiple fairies

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 20:49

it's possible the limitation is just poor understanding on my part
but uh, the math used for tying fairies to enemies was fuckin weird
glad it's deprecated
