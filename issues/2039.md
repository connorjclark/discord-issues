I know this has been addressed in some capacity a few months ago, so I'm not really sure what happened.  I probably just forgot.

The ideal behavior for the Cheat dialogue is that if we successfully enter any level of cheat code, a pop-up will tell us that the Level 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 cheat has been successfully entered, and upon hitting [Enter] (Or whatever that key is. Subscreen I guess.) the entire cheat dialogue goes away and we're put back into the live-action ZC, rather than the same cheat menu.

There's really no point in being on the cheat menu at all once a cheat has been properly input.  If we didn't know any other cheats, we'd still be guessing.  If we did know the cheat, we would've put in the highest level cheat we could because we're debugging our own quest or something.  

Am I missing something here?

there's situations in which you might want to turn cheats off

Hitting the toggle for "Off" should also close the cheat dialogue then, yes.
No point in getting in, doing what you intended to do, and the dialogue is still up so we have to close it.
It's just a basic quality of life change that helps in the long run.
