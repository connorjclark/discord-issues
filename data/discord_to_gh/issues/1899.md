It's a work in progress, I suppose.
1)  Assigning L or R to the Roc's Feather items doesn't register at all.  It's similar to as if this change hasn't been implemented yet.
2)  If you assign it to an Ex button as a shortcut, as per this ZC change, and also actually have the Roc's Feather item assigned to that button as an inventory item to use, the overlap causes the player to jump tremendously high. Though, having the Feather assigned to another button causes the new key shortcut to work fine, as does the item properly assigned to the Item button.

tl;dr:
1)  L or R doesn't work yet, apparently.
2)  Don't assigning the feather to the same button used as its new shortcut.

L or R work fine
As long as you have *quickswap disabled*
Quickswap eats the button inputs
...2 is definitely a problem I did not foresee

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 00:07

Hm.  Quickswap.  Where is that exactly, please?
Must've missed it in the quest rules, if it is one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 00:08

It is in one of the qr menus
Not at my pc to check
Probably misc tab if I had to guess

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 00:08

All good.  It'd be worth mentioning this particular foible in the Tooltip for this for the sake of L and R.
No sense in getting an endless stream of bug reports or help requests about it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 00:08

Oh wait I just looked at your screenshot
Huh
The qr is in your screenshot and is the correct setting
Bleh, why does that still eat the button?
So 2 problems

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 00:10

Shall I add information about that to the "Add more information to the..."  Feature request I just put in so we know to keep that particular quest rule checked?
.. I should just do it, just in case.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 00:11

I would frankly think it common sense that the button wouldn't do 2 different things

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 00:12

It's why I checked it.  It's just a common reminder that the quest rule exists, really.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 00:12

The fact that it still eats the input with it off, though, is a bug (err, the qr on, which means the swap feature off)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 00:12

Like, "Oh, I should turn that on too?  Great, I'll do that now."
Idiot-proof it now, and save time later by not fielding stupid questions.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 00:13

If we idiot proofed everything to that level in the program
The program wouldn't be able to run because the info text would be greater than the memory limit
Idiot-proofing takes a damn lot
And, I doubt it would help much
I still get questions daily where I need to answer "Did you look at the ? button at all??"

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 00:15

Sure.  That trains them to look at ALL of the buttons, hopefully, not just the relevant ones.  It's a step in the right direction.  If the information is there, at least a hint of it, it's far better than the nothing we might not know it is.
I know what you mean.  Really, I do.
It's good to have multiple perspectives working on this.
No one is more critical of their art than the artist.

Fixed the L/R eating the inputs even when L/R quickswap is disabled part of this (not in the nightly that just went up)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2022 05:45

....and should have fixed the jumping twice in one frame too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2022 09:46

@ Changeling this should also be testable in the build that just went up

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/24/2022 09:47

Indeed.  Works fine.  Thanks bunchly.
Assigned it to all four buttons and L and R real quick.
