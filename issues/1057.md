Wouldn't be possible to have bracelets that have a noticeable effect on pushing speeds on lower tiered/leveled blocks. An example being a Lv2 Bracelet pushing a Lv0 Block at a noticeably faster speed. Partially quoting myself but I think this simple tweak might be a good idea.

Wouldn't be level-based, would be an attribute of the bracelet item

I see.

And also ability to push multiple blocks at the same time.

oh
that uh, is less easy
because that requires rewriting how the movingblock sprite is handled
