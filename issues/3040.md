I'm wondering if this is possible so we can test it in the text box rather than having to check in-game every time.

It's kinda janky and doesn't really work with the x/y being global instead of per-string
...ideally we'd want to change this to a per-string thing instead of global

=== @ Jared 02/04/2024 06:01

Yes PLEASE
Especially if we need to move a string up top then down low etc

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/04/2024 06:05

(...do note that it can be an offset from the top-left of the string, so if all your string boxes are the same height...)

Oh I know lol
As of now they're all the same height lol
