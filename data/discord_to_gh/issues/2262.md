on Linux Mint, the Script Debugger being opened on game launch causes the game window to never open. The processes stick around, but the window itself never appears.

Setting ZScript_Debugger to = 0 in zc.cfg causes the game to open correctly again.

@ Entropy Can you cause it to fail, and then send `allegro.log` after doing so?

....mhh, I think I see what's wrong...
@ Entropy try the build that will go up in ~30 mins

allegro.log just in case

huh, nothing helpful in there
other than *my god why is it tracing so much about the title screen*
blah people leave too many random prints in the code
