We have TileModifier for Items, but it would be nice if we could get the total TileModifier number for the player. This would make setting up new animations for tile shifted characters a breeze.

`Hero->TileMod`
```
int TileMod;
 * Read-only
 * The current *total* Player Tile Modifier.```
(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒TileModifier for Hero
