There is a string bug in string 754 and also 752 when i pick up random items in my game, it keeps triggering these message strings to show up.

is it actually random items, or is it specific items?
Is it the same item, is it items specifically from shops?

Random items

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 01/19/2022 11:47

All items i am picking up are constantly doing this,  but it's a string thing, i have been having this problem for quite a while now.
There are some other message strings that are showing, i gotta find them and then i will write them here soon.
is my bed time now.

also, what alpha are you using?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 01/19/2022 22:52

Latest one

Actually, just to clarify
Do these strings only play on screens that have a "shop cave"?
and if so, what do the items in the shop cost? (specifically the last one)
Do they cost 754 or 752 rupees?

Oh?
Does that affect something?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 22:29

Yeah, it causes a bug similar to what you're describing

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/02/2022 06:28

Oh ok
Yeah its those strings so far.
If i find more strings later on i will report them.
But so far it's just those two strings.
i think is what you described also yes.*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/02/2022 06:34

no, don't report more
it'll be whatever the rupee count is

it'll be fixed in next build

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/02/2022 06:36
