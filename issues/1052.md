Pretty much what it says on the tin, lemme know if I'm doing something stupid here :/

Script is in the buffer, assigned to the enemy's weapon, and isn't tracing or playing the sound when the moblin fires

Expanding on the issue, lweapon scripts also appear to be gone. Stuck one on the wand, nothing happen

so the weapon has a script assigned to it from the enemy data
it's just... not working

=== @ Moosh 09/27/2021 02:51

NPC scripts appear unaffected, they still run as expected
So it's just weapons

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2021 02:53

Just EWeapons, or LWeapons too?
And what about itemsprites?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2021 02:56

OH fuck I'm dumb aren't I

=== @ Moosh 09/27/2021 03:00

sorry for late response, itemsprites still work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2021 03:03

lweapons?

=== @ Moosh 09/27/2021 03:04

EWeapons and LWeapons are the only scripts that I've observed have the problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2021 03:06

GAH there's the typo
hopefully that fixes it...

Provided this works, is it safe to develop in?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2021 03:11

provided this works I'll be posting it in #deleted-channel
so yes
this includes #975 too, now

=== @ Moosh 09/27/2021 03:15

Eyyy it all works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2021 03:17

There's some stupid variable naming
And a backend refactor of some code left something checking `script` instead of `weaponscript`
... nice thing is now sprites (npc/wpn/itmspr) don't allocate script info or stack memory unless they have a script
And they all use a consistent function for script running
.... but weapons have a tiny difference for no good reason, thanks zoria.
