So I have scripts that are in a certain folder whose code is not being analyzed by the parser, leading to it skipping most compile errors and not recognizing any scripts or functions imported in these files. Emily is also completely baffled at this.
I have sent the files to Emily because I wish to keep them private.

I moved my files into a different, preexisting, header folder and it is being analyzed.

=== @ Orithan 10/20/2022 03:26

Made a new folder, moved my files there, it's not being analyzed

=== @ Orithan 10/20/2022 03:28

...
I found the culprit - It's the names of the files themselves.
Somewhere down the line the parser is getting confused between different files which have the same name.

=== @ Orithan 10/20/2022 03:30

Other files I'm running in different headers are sharing the same names as the ones in this folder, which is confusing the parser after the syntax stage.

I thought I fixed this already????

@ Orithan confirm?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/07/2022 09:50

@ Orithan ?

=== @ Orithan 11/07/2022 09:51

Right now I've been busy with other stuff

=== @ Orithan 11/09/2022 05:04

Tested and am getting a different error

=== @ Orithan 11/09/2022 05:06

``..\ZC Repos\SoulHunter_Codebase\Headers\ffcscript.zh Line 6 @ Columns 11-35 - Error S008: There is already a variable with name FFCS_INVISIBLE_COMBO in this scope.``
This seems to disable the safeguard from importing multiple instances of the same header

=== @ Orithan 11/09/2022 05:10

I don't think this was a bug - I think this was Header Guard doing it's thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 06:14

no, it was a bug
this error is to be expected
because you aren't importing the same file twice
you are importing 2 different files of the same name, at different locations
your error here is that ffcscript.zh is part of std_zh, and you are also including it yourself from another location.
that is a script error on your part

=== @ Orithan 11/09/2022 06:36

This did not happen before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 06:37

Correct, because it was bugged
It *should* have been happening before
I may be able to do something to handle this, but it will require a whole new feature
and, would require editing any script files you wanted to have managed by it

=== @ Orithan 11/09/2022 10:38

Well it fixed the original issue
