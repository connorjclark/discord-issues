In the right-click menu (when right-clicking on the combo pane), an entry labeled "Generate Combo Report"

This has the effect of spitting out a text file named `QuestName_ComboID_###.txt` and is just a list dump of every single piece of information contained in that combo. including blank/zero/unedited/default values. Every text field, every dropdown menu, every checkbox. Every possible thing that can be edited by a user.

Cuz I need an easy way to compare two combos between the normal build and the Z3 build so I can verify it is the Z3 build that broke something.
