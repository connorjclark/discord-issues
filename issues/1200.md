...this frankly shouldn't be that bad, so long as it works on layers.

Switchhook target combo type, with option to "break" (displaying a specified combo for a short while as a 'breaking animation') upon switch; or simply swap, placing the combo on the layer it was originally on at Link's position.
'Switchhook Required Level" attribute also makes sense.

Switchhook item flag for "only replace combo 0", if set the switch will fail if the combo that would be replaced is non-zero.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) @ P-Tux7 adding to thread
So far:

(None of these do ANYTHING, but it's all labeled with help text, so it's outlined)

=== @ P-Tux7 12/08/2021 21:52

ok just before you get into this
```The Switch Hook is obtained in the Skull Dungeon. The item functions similarly to a Hookshot by extending and retracting, however, when Link fires the Switch Hook, he will switch places with whatever it grabs onto. The Switch Hook is able to grab onto most objects and enemies, including objects such as Jars or large diamonds, the latter of which only react to the Switch Hook. After grabbing onto the object or enemy, Link and the grabbed thing will momentarily disappear before switching to opposite sides. Because of this, the Switch Hook is mainly used to cross areas by switching sides, as well as solving puzzles, usually by moving an object over. Some enemies are especially susceptible to the Switch Hook, such as Iron Masks, whose masks can be removed by using the Switch Hook.```
this means that in oracles link could swap positions with npcs not immune to the switch hook, and it can remove shields from enemies (not sure if that's direction-dependent like the hammer)
it will probably work with most simple enemies but the multi-part bosses will likely break
(i mean, they WERE immune to it in said game, but in zc you can make anything vulnerable to anything so...)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 21:57

I completely hadn't considered enemies
but that would be a thing
Now, my interesting question is how to make bushes etc react to it properly
They'll need yet more flags

=== @ P-Tux7 12/08/2021 22:06

i'm pretty sure in oracles it just snaps onto the nearest "combo" yeah?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 22:06

well, the issue is telling it what combos it can switch with
and what to do with them when it grabs them
for instance, pots/bushes break when they land

=== @ P-Tux7 12/08/2021 22:07

oh yeah, like does it use the undercombo, or layer beneath the bush

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 22:07

So right now, the plan is to swap the combo at both positions
having it use the undercombo instead would be an easy checkbox
(it would swap *on the same layer*, so if it's placed on a layer, it would swap with the potentially empty combo on the layer)

=== @ P-Tux7 12/08/2021 22:08

also isn't everything a potential "bushes etc" since everything can be triggered

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 22:09

it can't work for just everything, because it needs too many settings
the SwitchHook Block combo type should be able to handle most things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 22:10

What I could do is, give every combo a swappable flag
and make bushes/slashes break as though slashed when they swap
and the SwitchHook Block combo type would be more configurable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 22:42

I think the switchhook might re-use the hookshot weapon type, but with a flag set to tell it it's a switchhook instead

=== @ P-Tux7 12/08/2021 22:42

mm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 22:42

that'll save a LOT of hassle
and it'll automatically inherit all of the chains and the like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 22:44

woo, hookshot help text done
now copying it all to switchhook
It'll be able to function entirely like the hookshot, including being able to block/reflect projectiles
but, it'll use a separate enemy defense, and swap positions instead of damage the enemy
and do different combo collision checks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 23:31

Sooo, a second item sfx field could be useful, yeah?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2021 23:32

(meta) thread name was changed: üîìSwitchhook

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/09/2021 21:06

For the time being I'm going to make it only do combos
enemy support can be added later
with a flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 00:57

OK so

An interesting floor pattern, yes?
well

that's what the screen looked like to start
before I started switchhooking it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 01:41

It swaps Link's `+8,+8` combo position with whatever it collides with
The one that explodes is using an arbitrary misc sprite I assigned, and drops a green rupee specifically (though can use any dropset or specific item, similar to bushes)
those are all on layer 0
which is why it changes the floor
(if they were on layer 1, it would swap with the combo 0 on layer 1, thus not fucking the floor)
Also, if there are multiple switchable blocks stacked in the same position, it should move *all* of them together
Only layers 0,1,2 can be hit by the switchhook right now (since it's using the hookshot code)
but ANY layer that has a switchblock at that position will have it moved

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 01:45

Gotta get off for the night now, just gonna drop a couple notes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 01:47

1. forgot to remove a zprint
2. Need to prevent the switchhook from clipping through walls that are too close to you (the hookshot doesn't have the problem, so it's in the non-shared starter collision block)
3. Need to add the `Is Switch-Hookable` generic combo flag to the combo editor GUI, so that I can test other combo types being switched; esp. slashable types, as they have special behavior.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/10/2021 01:53

oooooh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 01:56

slash types (bush, flowers, etc) will act as though they were slashed at the new position (never replacing the combo, they just explode at the new pos)
pretty much identically to what the white block does in the video

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 03:01

ooh
i wonder what the animation was in oracles
i want to say a poof at both locations without a pause?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 03:03

https://youtu.be/A106F0ITZ0g?t=439
Lifts both into the air
then swaps
right now I just have it swapping
to have it lift both in the air would be odd with the fact that it isn't just swapping Link with a combo, but actually swapping both combos
because, you know, of how combos work, kinda no choice but to do that
so to do an in the air animation will be a bit harder

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 03:51

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "https://youtu.be/A106F0ITZ0g?‚Ä¶"): eww
my vote definitely goes to "both puff out and puff back in"
with the addition of not being able to control link during that animation

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 03:53

You know, that might make sense for a Switch Rod...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 03:53

You can't control Link, as you are in the "hookshot pulling you animation" state
this literally is ripping so much of it's functionality from the hookshot

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 03:56

ah good

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 03:59

#deleted-channel
i'd move this to feature requests if we could figure out a more elegant solution to the multiple shots hitting things at the same time issue
or if it's just hardcoded to only allow one shot on-screen

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 04:09

the combo-swapping functions are script-readable/writable, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 04:09

err, ?
what are you asking for to be writable @ P-Tux7 ?
what do you mean by `the combo-swapping functions`?

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 04:13

err sorry i meant combo-writing functions
when the switch hook block swaps with link

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 04:13

....err
nothing new is added to script
but
to code that in zscript
would be DEAD EASY, even in 2.50

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 04:14

ok good i was worried that the script request would require rewriting a lot of stuff the switch hook already has, causing redundancy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 04:15

I mean
You literally
just move Link's X/Y
and write to ComboD/ComboC
the hard part is the hook extending, and figuring out what to swap with and etc
actually swapping with a combo is trivial

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 06:27

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the hard part is the hook ext‚Ä¶"): lucky that there's no hook for the switch rod then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 06:30

indeed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 04:07

@ P-Tux7 @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) https://youtu.be/A4Kd6x3paNM
here we gooo
Standing directly against a switch-hookable combo now *immediately* locks you onto it (instead of either not allowing using it, or clipping through it, both of which happened previously....)
Hooking a `Bush->Next` or `Flowers` or etc (any slashable combo type), will act as though it were slashed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 04:10

it leaves behind either the `next` combo, or the `undercombo`, depending on the type
and does not affect the combo the player is standing on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 04:11

A `SwitchHook Block` combo, such as the large tree there, can be configured various ways; here it can only be swapped with 'combo 0', and swaps any placed flags at it's position with it (not that that does anything particular in the test)
Note that the flowery bushes in the upper-right are on layer *6*
there is a new QR, allowing hookshots and switchhooks to work on *any* layer.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 04:14

I also tested switching with a `None` combo, and it works fine. It has no special effect, does not break, etc; it just swaps positions with where you are standing.

ooh indeed, yeah?

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:45

Oh geez you made the switchhook effect an enemy defense?
That's gonna be wicked cool for puzzle quests I imagine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:47

The switchhook itself will switch with a `None` defense as well
but other weapons can *borrow* the switchhook behavior
as long as the switchhook is not blocked/ignored, it should switch

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:48

I do wish there was a visual effect of some sort. Though the pause before switching at least does help to sell it some

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:48

Visual effects are on the list still
....though it'll be interesting making that work for non-switchhook weapons
also need to make the switching sound settable for non-switchhook weapons, which is the current project
You know how I added a misc sprites dialog?

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:50

Misc sounds time?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:50

Well, I'm working on a misc SFX dialog next
which will be new gui system
and will allow us to remove hardcoded sfx throughout the program

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:51

I'll probably allow a couple different transition effects
a "poof" effect should be simple enough
a "flicker out, then back in" should also be fairly doable

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:52

Lift up could work provided the quest only places switchables on layer 1 & 2
And could be compatible with 0, it'd just look funny

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:53

Yeah, that's the only issue I have with it
but, as long as it isn't *default*, it should be fine

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:54

Okay...so...the Farore explode effect, but the particles swap places and then reform and they each follow a bezier curve path üòà

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:54

The fun question is how to set this... it's gonna need to be init data, I guess, for non-switchhook weapons

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:55

I imagine any of the loose things that are being put in init data could be moved to another menu should the need arise?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:56

Yeah, though I don't know what other menu it would go in
it realistically is part of init data
plus, being in init data, cheat L3 lets you change it during play

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:56

There's some general trends, like some stuff that's in vars could be grouped under "physics" for organization sake

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:57

perhaps before we release a thorough sorting would make sense

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 11:28

one thing that will probably need a script to test it is what happens if two switch hook-spoofing weapons hit two different combos at the same frame

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 11:30

i might be able to test it using magic prisms and immobile enemies though...
still, this is insanely neat, thank you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 11:36

The weapons only work on enemies, is the problem
because it's a defense type
though the answer is, if a switch is in progress, it disallows any more from happening

=== @ P-Tux7 12/12/2021 11:52

so is switch hook a spoofable weapon type?
though i guess it's not like hookshot-spoofing weapons drag you or anything
hrmmm
switch hook block combos, and you set "triggered by"?
though that might be a tad restrictive since no bushes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 11:57

not really a good way to do it
anyway

};```
Easy expansion misc sfx dialog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 12:05

So, need to set up visual effects.
0 = Poof
1 = Flicker
2 = Rise
probably not doing this tonight though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 01:11

K, getting work done on this, and immediately running into hard-to-solve problems
So, enemies? Easy as crap.
Should just be able to add a y-offset for rise, and a conditional draw for flicker, to `sprite::draw()` based on a flag. (Poof won't even take anything special there!)
Combos? Hoooo boy
The problem with combos is breakable combos
because they shouldn't break until the *end* of the animation
but right now, they break at the time of swapping
....to have them break *later* won't work, conventionally, as the combo would stop existing at the moment of the swap; as breakables don't override their destination
so, I'm going to need to make a new `class breakable : public sprite`
which will draw a combo, with the appropriate sprite::draw things from enemies (can actually share that code!)
and then *break* when it's timer hits 0
....the breakable type will likely be able to be re-used for things like #1199, with some modifications.
but, alas, time for dinner for now.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/13/2021 03:21

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "which will draw a combo, with‚Ä¶"): you mean "draw a sprite from a combo" right
i assume this is the same type of sprite that persists across a warp if you have "sprites carry over through warps" checked in screen data right
now there's something i'll need to test along with the prism'd switch magic hitting two enemies at the same time thing - if overhead carried stuff persists through warps

=== @ P-Tux7 12/13/2021 03:24

i'll either test it after you release a build or you can test it yourself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 03:28

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i assume this is the same typ‚Ä¶"): sprite is sprite
it's the base graphical class
enemies, link, weapons, decorations, etc are ALL sprites

=== @ P-Tux7 12/13/2021 03:31

yeah theres some weird fun to be had with that
guys, shops, life or money, pay for info, gamble, etc. are all sprites too
i know guys are enemies but youd think zelda classic would catch on fire if it tries warping a pay for info room with you but, it actually works
this can be done for a whole bunch of douchey fun in older versions
always-respawning patra 3s, life or money, or feed the goriya rooms anyone (it works because you only kill them in the warped-via-pit-warp room, so the original room never flags them as dead)
(though respawning items via pit warps works as a free magic refill room or a respawning minigame prize - so at least that's neat)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 03:35

OK, so the rising and poof anim styles both work for enemies
NOTHING about breakable combos works right now, though... for some reason a block of code isn't running at all that should be

=== @ P-Tux7 12/13/2021 03:36

dont you love the sinking feeling you get when you realize that you will realize that you did something stupid in 30 minutes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 03:38

the `breakable` constructor is running fine
but `breakable::animate` is NEVER being called??

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 03:43

ohhhh fuck me
I fucked this up back with portals, too
but, they are more hardcoded, so it didn't end up mattering

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 03:44

`animate()` != `animate(int32_t index)`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 03:54

OK, so all 3 animation styles work for enemies now
and they also work for breakable combos, after the swap
non-breakable combos, as well as breakables before the swap, needs to be handled during combo drawing... so that's the next mission

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 04:48

https://youtu.be/GR95w4xUrFs

=== @ Moosh 12/13/2021 04:51

The lifting definitely looks the best. Nice
Is the animation speed configurable?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 06:28

^ To answer in the thread, the poof animation uses the speed of the poof sprite assigned. The other two styles are 64 frames exactly, non-configurable (and making the flicker configurable would be very difficult)
Left todo:
```Script access to:
switchhookclk
switchhookmaxtime
npc->switch_hooked

Init Data: switch style (//!TODO init data switch style)```

=== @ P-Tux7 12/13/2021 07:36

by the way is this extended replacement of sound effects meant for copyright or just better quest ease of development

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 07:52

Making things not hardcoded

=== @ P-Tux7 12/13/2021 07:56

like, this doesn't solve the issue of modules breaking old quest sfx does it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 07:58

No, nothing can
I mean, I removed sfx.dat from modules
It can never be a functioning part of them
I plan to rip modules apart and redo most of their features better

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 14:50

Okay, so @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I'm about to reinvent the concept of "fuck you Deedee"
are you ready?
Rotating animation type
Everything has it's dir change and rotate in a complete half-cicle, similar to the Warp Doll
(except the combo because combos don't have directions)

=== @ P-Tux7 12/13/2021 15:55

yuck no
just focus on alpha 100 for now

=== @ P-Tux7 12/13/2021 16:12

i didn't even think the switch hook WAS for alpha 100

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 23:26

OK
so, I now have it so scripts can read the data necessary
```cpp
bool SwitchHooked;
 * READ-ONLY
 * Returns true if the NPC is currently grabbed by a switchhook effect```
```cpp
int SwitchTimer;
 * READ-ONLY
 * The timer for the switchhook effect. If > 0, a switch effect is active.
 * The player will swap positions with the target when this is equal to
 *     (Hero->SwitchMaxTimer / 2), and the animation completes when this
 *     reaches 0.

int SwitchMaxTimer;
 * READ-ONLY
 * The starting (max) value of the switch timer.

bool SwitchNPC(npc n, int effect);
 * Switch the player with the given npc
 * Use the 'SW_EFF_' constants from std_constants.zh for 'effect'

 * Returns true if it is successful```
The only thing is, it doesn't play an sfx when it switches you; it leaves that for the script to do
....which also tells me I need to give access to misc sfx
