You can make unique triggers in the combo editor now, which is convenient. But they do not respect the Trigger->Self Only flag.
Unless I completely misunderstood how this feature works and set it up wrong, that is
Hitting them also does not play the screen's Secret Sound

uh, it isn't designed to
at all
you can have customly triggering it cause it to `->Next` or `->Previous`
....the screen secret sound is a bit more of an issue, though I could SWEAR we specifically already fixed that?

my build is not the most recent
so that might very well be the case
