`dosubscr` controls opening/closing the subscreen. During this, the framebuf is used to draw as the background, under the subscreen wipe. If COOLSCROLL is off (meaning none of a number of modern QRs are on), then `dosubscr` will use `scrollbuf` instead of `framebuf`.

In `draw_screen`, scrollbuf and framebuf is drawn to, but the former is missing a few things. I'm not sure any are actually important, so this is just keeping exact compatability for no real reason. Which is probelmatic because it doubles the amount of drawing being done ... just in case the user is about to press ENTER on a really old quest.

example of difference (top is expected output, bottom is "just use the full frame"):

so...

1) is it fine for `dosubscr` to render the full frame, so enemies and w/e else is the difference between framebuf and scrollbuf are shown?

2) does draw_screen even need to draw to `scrollbuf`? aka, does anything else use draw_screen's limited rendering to scrollbuf _in a way that matters_?
found this because z3 branch greatly simplified draw_screen by not drawing so much to scrollbuf in draw_screen. this is the only replay that is failing atm (just added, so no other replay exercised this code branch).

This change seems fine to make, and makes other stuff simpler, so I'll start on it now.

Hiding some elements of the screen while the subscreen is opening/closing seems like a pointless feature, and complicates the rendering.

@ Russ just wanna bring in a quest making expert here... can you think of a reason why this is a good thing to have?

=== @ Russ 01/22/2024 00:40

Off the top of my head, I can't think of any situation where this would break things

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/22/2024 00:41

I think its just adherence to how NES (i assume) works, but that's not worth the cost imo
as long as there are no weird gameplay changes this would cause, i'm all for some simplification

So if I'm understanding right the top here is the old behavior and bottom is the new? And most of the screen was being drawn every frame to a bitmap that was going unused most of the time? Just to hide sprites when certain rules were enabled?

=== @ Moosh 01/22/2024 01:17

In my opinion the bottom behavior is preferable in most circumstances. If it's possible to preserve the top for really old quests that would still be nice but it isn't worth impacting performance for

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/22/2024 01:25

Yup you got it

Here's all the changes (improvements, imo) https://zc-replay-compare-7606182864.surge.sh/
nothing looks awry
