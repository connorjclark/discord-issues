Latest Nightly, Feb. 16.  When grabbing an FFC by holding it with the mouse button, it will immediately snap the FFC 5 pixels downward.  In the last alpha (a111) it would keep it at its position until you moved the mouse

OK
Someone needs to hang for this one
for fucks sake
when you have a variable
already
in the function
that you are *already using for other stuff*
....why the FUCK would you HARDCODE THAT VALUE IN ONE SPECIFIC SPOT?

(For the record, it was the height of the titlebar breaking this- the new fonts. It fucking hardcoded the height of that in the mouse position calculation.)
this, like #2183 , is kinda tangled in the small mode removal stuff, so while I *HAVE* fixed the issue, it will still be broken until the nightly after the next alpha.
