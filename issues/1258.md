I'd really love to have an availablle Re-/Deflect Attribute for Swords.
(like for Boomerangs and Shields)

...to allow authentical Agahnim/Mastersword PingPong

This makes sense, though swords are a pain to work with... definitely a good idea though

Yeah, the LWeapon Type Sword is an istant basic engine thing and I guess it's really hard to rewrite/advance its behavior.

But if this might be possible in future ...I would definitly appreciate it
