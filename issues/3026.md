Suppose I have a range of spike combos that raise and lower themselves from the floor, but I have multiple visual variations of them.  So I'd have to have multiple sets of these cycled combos.

If I pasted the range, I'd have to go into each individual combo, click the Combo Cycle box, and press "down" several times to go to the next visual variation I'd made.

Here, with the numerical box, there would be an offset value added to each successively pasted combo that would add a number of combo IDs to the value of the pasted combos for their Next Cycled Combo box.

That way, the work would already be done.

For example, for these spikes, the value in the box would be 8 to paste the top row of spikes to the bottom row.

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "For example, for these spikes‚Ä¶"): can advanced paste be used on a range of source combos?
(I know you can paste one source to multiple destinations, but IDR if you can actually copy multiple combos to advanced paste an area...)

An excellent question!  I'm using the latest 3.0 pre nightly thing.  I'll illustrate my experiment in real time with screenshots.

I've copied the upper row of these combos, and will copy that row to the entire rest of the range.

And this is the result.

So it seems to only have copied the upper left combo to the rest.

So I suppose not.  Maybe it could only work if the destination paste is the same quantity of combos as the source copy.  

Can copy and paste features even check to see if the amount of combos is the same, first?
Wouldn't be the worst thing if there was a sanity check to see if the amount of combos is the same between the copy and paste.

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "So I suppose not.  Maybe it c‚Ä¶"): *can*, I mean, yes
but, the code around copy/pasting areas of things is SO damn complex
like, absurdly not fun
(pasting ONE thing is easy, MULTIPLE is fucking awful)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/30/2024 10:39

(Currently, it does not do it if there's an equal source and destination.)

I'm sure I'd agree.  Saving dev time and attention is important as well, so consider this shelved.  <:salute:1082579749106368512>
Thank you anyway though!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 10:39

An offset could still be added
but, like

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/30/2024 10:39

One combo paste at a time.

EDIT:  Leaving for work now.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 10:39

...to add it just for cycle combos seems weird, given that other things could also use it
what about lifted combos
what about lift undercombo
what about triggers stuff
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so yeah, not sure it's the most useful addition with only one combo at a time as well
and doing this properly would be kinda bleh
Also, the advanced paste dialog would need to be rewritten a fair bit
because currently it's using a generic dialog that just creates a list of checkboxes
which, obviously, no longer works by adding more things
(Note that items now also have advanced paste, which uses the SAME generic dialog)
(the idea being that other advanced pastes would also be addable as we go)
so yeah, gonna close this. Neat idea in theory, just, not so practical lol
