It occurs on that line, saying it's accessing bad memory
but it isn't NULL

oh, correction
Killing 2 or more heads of a manhandla on the same FRAME crashes
killing one at a time does not crash
Using the 'kill all enemies' cheat does cause it

Ahk, don't know why this only occurred in a copy of 1st.qst
but
it's now fixed
just needed to add some sanity checks
