This would flag the item as being dropped by the given NPC UID, where you can do things involving it like referencing the NPC's ItemSet and doing drops based off that.
For non-NPC drops, they can be -1.

if it's dropped by the enemy, then the enemy no longer exists, so how are you going to reference it's pointer?
Or do you mean `ID` rather than `UID`?

=== @ Orithan 07/18/2022 08:38

Either that and/or a way to just reference the enemy's dropset it had at the time

=== @ Orithan 07/18/2022 08:40

I'm just looking for a clean way to manipulate drops without directly going into the item dropsetdata because modifying that to give concrete increases to drop rate sounds like jank.

=== @ Orithan 07/18/2022 08:48

Alternatively I would like a clean way to force an enemy to drop a specific item on death without needing to make item sets for every single possible drop

...can you script enemies to "carry" items for one frame a la the Z1 enemies that carry keys?
That's in-engine for Enemy 0 but IDK if it can be assigned to one through scripts, or if you can pick a non-screen item for it to carry

=== @ Orithan 07/19/2022 17:21

IIRC only once such item can be on screen at a time

=== @ Orithan 07/19/2022 17:30

```bool HasItem;                
 * Returns if the enemy is holding the screen item.```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 23:28

(replying to @ Orithan "Either that and/or a way to j…"): this would be the saner way to handle it, something like...```
int DroppedBy;
 * The dropset ID that dropped this item.
 * -1 if item was not dropped from a dropset.```
(mostly noting this to bump the thread so I remember it later when I'm up to adding that)

=== @ Orithan 07/23/2022 01:01

That would be fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/16/2022 21:51

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "this would be the saner way t…"): took me like a month to get around to it, but this should be done

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/16/2022 23:43

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅item DroppedBy

=== @ P-Tux7 08/17/2022 17:51

What were you thinking of using it for, Orithan?
