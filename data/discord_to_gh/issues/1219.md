In ALTTP the default button for swing your sword was the B Button and due to recent updates regarding button mapping, ZC finally has enough buttons to mimic the ALTTP button mapping for those quest aiming to mimic ALTTP. It would be ideal to have the freedom to change the default sword button to B for certain quests, although I can forsee some tweaks being required for certain other QRs.
