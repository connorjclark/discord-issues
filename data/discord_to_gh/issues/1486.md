Setting some Misc. Color options as 0x00 does not make that option transparent (BS Minimap Dark is an example)

Is this SUPPOSED to happen?
Like, either being transparent or black
Which is "on-spec" here, developers?

I'm not sure if it is supposed, either way it is inconsistent between the options whether it is black or transparent. It would at least be nice to specify which ones with a "?" or something if it can't be streamlined

What I understand from an NES standpoint, the 0x00 in the background would be black wheras 0x00 would be transparent in the sprite layer.  The minimap rectangle is in a background layer and te minimap marker would be in a sprite layer.
