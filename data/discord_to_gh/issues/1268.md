As the Candle has options for melee sprites, it would be nice to see those have the potential to cause damage like the Wand melee can.

i don't quite get it - can't the wand rod code be copied?
the only thing they can do is harm and use can slash flags
(meta) thread name was changed: Candle Melee and Can Slash Flags

can the *insert melee anything here* be done easily? no

it's not like the sword where you have all the spin attack charge up stuff

it's not so simple as copying one thing
it's copying all very specific like 80 things
without fucking any of them up
and making sure it works right for the candle without fucking things up with the flag off

i could have sworn byrna had melee without an associated combo trigger... maybe i was wrong
