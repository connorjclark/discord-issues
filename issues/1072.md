A new dialog for all types of QRs

so adding a new QR just requires adding a string and the qr constant to a listdata
....only did the compatrules so far, but, shouldn't be bad to add them all
and then we no longer need separate dialogs for every type of quest rule

....That was REALLY fucking easy

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 17:00

old cset2 handling?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 17:01

that's a bugfix for....
#1047

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 17:01

oh mm thanks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 17:02

but anyway, the big point is, all the QR dialogs now being one
....well, just Anim, Combos, and Compat so far, but it is going quickly adding more
And also it makes it SO MUCH easier to add new QRs in the future
because, what this is doing is
I just give it a list of QR constants paired with strings
and it generates all the checkboxes automatically
including adding new tabs
so just add `{ "Some New Rule", qr_SOME_NEW_RULE }` to the end of a list, and viola, new QR added
instead of needing to add like 10 different things manually

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 20:06

OK
So I realized quite suddenly
that Small Mode was going to be a big problem
....so, did some work

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893895991458148372/893952256775430194/unknown.png?ex=65ecc16a&is=65da4c6a&hm=6d68a7285b20ab7060c099bc09ec1e1dca468f3a759d30a7f779a9bb628deb1f&)
and viola it fits in small mode

Now, if there's only 1 tab, it doesn't display a tabpanel
it just displays the contents

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 20:57

should bs zelda animation and expanded link LTMs be moved to link?
given that new enemy tiles is in enemies
also "Scroling"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 20:59

you know
part of the reason that none of those were moved
is because moving things between dialogs was absolutely painful
.....with this system it's literally moving one line.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 21:48

oh yeah i'd say invincible link flickers -> link
items held continue to animate -> link or items
(whatever it goes under, the "link holds up bombs too whenever other items would be held up" one should go there too)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 21:50

BS Zelda Animation affects more than just link
so, that stays in animation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 21:52

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "(whatever it goes under, the…"): That's NES Fixes, so stays

It doesn't need arrows to scroll, at least in large mode

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 22:02

does "disable 4-way gridlock" grey out without new hero movement?
if not, it should at least say it requires the above rule

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:02

does it require that?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 22:02

coulda sworn it did but... old server
i'll download the newest nightly later and see
oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:03

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): @ Moosh ^

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:04

now, small mode, is less fortunate

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893895991458148372/893981840052998194/unknown.png?ex=65ecdcf8&is=65da67f8&hm=afdc3dfa17bffd14f08e5d0949e70b27d7cc1cdd9d04434d0bbc15c7fbe986e1&)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 22:06

looks fine to me
much better than pre-2.50 small mode where all the rules were just blobbed together

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:13

OK, so now it's time for crazy ideas

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:14

I'm thinking of changing it from `Quest Rules` to `Quest Options`, and including an `Options` tab at the far left, which has a button to go to the Header, Pick Ruleset, and Map Count options
(which means I need to take the time to re-make all of those dialogs in the new system, so uh, that'll be a bit longer to get to)
but, then I can remove the submenu
instead of
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893895991458148372/893984490773418004/unknown.png?ex=65ecdf70&is=65da6a70&hm=175b5de43d65e5e27a618e23d60928dad2c6292477788b8595a2f9cfe2d46d13&)
it can just be the `Options` button itself

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 22:26

and init data

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:29

oh god
Init Data is a large project
(given, Saff showed some work on it)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 23:03


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893895991458148372/893996627319209984/unknown.png?ex=65eceabd&is=65da75bd&hm=609ec5b0b27ff089b832c24b1f2f8b2a66fe2f3de052b86a991b4449062c2a99&)
and zscript rules, too

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 23:12

mind if i start a second thread asking for some clarifications on the undocumented 2.55 rules

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 23:21

Sure

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 23:30

ok i will after the next build gets posted

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 10:22

OK, so

Options tab now
The `Header` and `Map Count` buttons don't do anything yet
but

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893895991458148372/894167534830485514/unknown.png?ex=65e44f69&is=65d1da69&hm=21622ad5cbe345855380be5ac3a4846804f89a922eb33f1277aacbb64c42338a&)
`Pick Ruleset` works just fine, including the text in the right box swapping when you click a radioproc

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893895991458148372/894167782747406336/unknown.png?ex=65e44fa4&is=65d1daa4&hm=d9c9eb118a2040fe5ee86161a9cdeeddc11d2143d270612247944546817d70d7&)

small-mode view for those who care
Also @ Saffith , that's a frame proc.... but not a frame widget.
I added a property `f_FRAMED` to all widgets
and if a widget has the flag set `framed = true,`
it will generate a frame proc as part of the widget
Likewise, I added `Padding` for all 4 sides
similar to margins, but padding is *inside* the border area, while margins are *outside* the border area
default widget value now has 0px margins, but the old default margin values are now the default padding values
Also added `new_text_proc`, for `Label` to use, and improved `Label`'s width calculation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 10:27

`new_text_proc` should absolutely prevent draws outside the proc area (via subbitmap), and also handles alignment (it calls `jwin_text_proc`, `jwin_ctext_proc`, or `jwin_rtext_proc` based on d1, set by the `textAlign` property

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 11:03

pushed and merged what I have here, the buttons that do nothing are greyed out now
gonna take a break for a bit, and I'll probably work on those next

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 00:48

So this is the old header

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 00:55

now

(The favorite command for `Header` will still directly open the header dialog, bypassing the quest_rules dialog)
