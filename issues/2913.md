@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) If I have an existing, but unplayed on, save file, then there's this oddity:
- Press A to bring up the quest info, then A again to re-select the quest.
- Upon selecting a new quest, playing the save file plays the newly selected quest.
- Upon quitting (without saving), press A on the save slot tells you it still belongs to the newly selected quest.... but trying to play it again loads the PREVIOUSLY selected quest.

Pushed some fixes to main, try now?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2023 19:42

file starts as `testsign.qst`. Changing it to `testloop.qst` works, at first, but then it unexpectedly reverts to loading `testsign.qst`

not reproducing..

was that slot _made_ w/ my latest changes or was pre existing?
may not matter but idk whats going on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2023 21:57

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "not reproducing..

was that s…"): yes, made w/ your changes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2023 21:58

saves folder looks like this:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1186292546851323984/1187876760696651826/image.png?ex=65eb89f1&is=65d914f1&hm=c4f7306b6cecbdd72411d33e637c0b61bb665679e65680aedf507d8b4057740a&)
the `yuu` save was made before your changes, which I assume is related to the quest file name appearing
note that no `testloop-qst-foo.sav` was created

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/22/2023 22:01

it should save when you start for the first time (w/ the "has played" flag false), then if you reset and reassign the qstpath and start again, it should delete the old "unplayed" sav and make a new one in the same way
`saves_do_first_time_stuff` does all that

does not occur
`testsign-qst-foo` is the only file ever there
`order.txt` was updated when I loaded this, but it also says `testsign-qst-foo`
so perhaps whatever path you used is itself failing to be updated?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/22/2023 22:10

Can you explore `saves_do_first_time_stuff` in the debugger

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2023 22:10

sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2023 22:12

`save->write_to_disk` is false

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/22/2023 22:12

ooo
that be it, thx

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2023 22:22

ahh, it's because I wasn't recording replays, makes sense lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 04:55

pushed more fixes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 08:02

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ok to close now?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2023 08:04

seems ok now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 08:05

great
saving code is more complicated than it should be. not certain why but I blame the title screen code ...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2023 08:11

yeah, #2891 to just re-write the title screen would be nice

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 08:14

It may be more reasonable to greatly improve the launcher and manage saves there instead. Not sure what direction I want a new launcher to take just yet.
Last I was looking at it I was trying out Flutter for a better UI framework.
