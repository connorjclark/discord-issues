exactly what it's says on the tin. I have a custom Peahat 2 enemy that I made and well it's not firing it's project I set for it (I kinda expect it to fire the projectile intermittently while flying) and near the end of it's animation it flickers in and out of existance. I have gone ahead and taken screenshots of the enemy editor on my end so the devs can have an easier time replicating my edit, I've only snapshot values outside of the default for this enemy type.

Just now tested that build, still not shooting the fireball but the animation now works otherwise.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 11:49

oh, duh, entirely missed the part where it wasn't firing
but the flicker issue was a bug with `4-Frame Flying 8-Dir Firing` animation style

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/04/2021 11:50

I was kinda expecting my peahat 2 to shoot it's fireball while moving and ideally on the last frame where it's all yellow.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 11:52

Peahats have no weapon firing code

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 11:53

adding such would need to be a feature request... and likely one we would not take up because enemy code is not something we really want to touch right now
Or, you could use an NPC script

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/04/2021 11:55

I see...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 11:56

```cpp
npc script doFiring
{
    void run()
    {
        while(true)
        {
            if(this->Tile >= this->OriginalTile + 80)
            {
                while(this->Tile >= this->OriginalTile + 80)
                    Waitframe();
                this->Attack();
            }
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
That should work for you
When it hits the end of the 'firing' animation, it will shoot it's set weapon
