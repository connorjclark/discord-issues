Extra settings for the sound setting of a combo
-Play: (Once/Loop/Step): Loop is current behaviour, Once plays it once when the combo is cycled to, Step plays it when the combo is being treaded upon (Link state is walking and is on this combo. Needs air checks like conveyor belts!)

What exactly do you mean by "current behavior", combos don't have a generic sfx at the moment?
Adding the ability to have combos either:
- Play an SFX once when they appear (assuming they stay appeared for a full frame)
- Play an SFX continually while the combo is on screen
- Play the SFX on combo step similar to tall grass combos
...sounds pretty nice and probably doable.

I'm crazy.

The `appear` happens when the combo first goes to handle trigger timer checks for the first frame that combo exists
the `disappear` happens the first frame that the combo *is no longer there*- yes, the disappear for the combo happens after the combo is already gone. Magic.
loop sfx just repeats while the combo exists
walking sfx/spr loops / follows the player like Tall Grass sprites. Notably these both only occur while the player is in the `walking` action, which means standing still stops playing/displaying these.
The `standing` sfx/spr loops/follows the player EXACTLY like the walking ones, except, when the action is anything BUT `walking`. So, if you set both the same, it will always display.
Note that if you want to emulate a tall grass that ruffles as you move but does not while you stand still, you would want to use a separate animated walking sprite and nonanimated standing sprite.

Also, I split the general advanced paste into 3 categories

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "The `standing` sfx/spr loops/…"): wait uh oh... what about jumping and such

similar to how Ripples work, these require `z == 0` to occur.

phew, thanks
