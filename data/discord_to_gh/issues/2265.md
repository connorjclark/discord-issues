Set 2P for Flash, only shows one color.  Something seems to be fishy

Does this apply to other types of EWeapons? And does it apply to all sources of the EWeapon? Magic Octoroks, Wizzrobes, Magic Statues/Shooter Combos

I'll check it out later tonight
I know it definitely applied to Red and Blue Wizzrobes

=== @ NightmareJames 03/29/2023 17:26

Add Octorocks on Crack too

=== @ NightmareJames 03/29/2023 17:34

Yeah, fireballs dont' work either.  Have to auto-flash or manually animate them too

I'm pretty sure this is not a bug, this is these fields being meant for specific hardcoded purposes
