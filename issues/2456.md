We're kinkshaming the heck out of this function. Anyways, did a bit of a test to see what breaks in normal use of the function, that being trying to imitate all the default engine warp types:
* Opening wipe warps play twice, once reversed and then once forward, unlike engine opening wipe warps which start with a blackout. I think this should be an option but not the default because it's inconsistent
* Opening wipe warps fail to black the screen for one frame when using the fade to black warp type
* There is no good way to conditionally keep playing music like an engine warp would. It either always plays (even if the new dmap uses different music) or always restarts
* Cave/Item cellar and passage warps just don't work at all, they behave as instant warps and will bug out if directed to screen 80

I realize that last one seems unimportant, however _there are still quests that use these features_ so I think it's important that custom combo types using WarpEx to imitate warp functionality also be able to trigger those warp types.

1. fuck, gotta love wipes
2. fuck, gotta love wipes
3. That sounds fucking stupid, and definitely a bug.
4. This.... ü§¢ makes me feel pain, and is not critical to the functionality.

If there's any other quest rules I should know of that affect wipe animations (such as removing the blackout) LMK. I tried testing it with everything I could. Wipes seemed to be the only one that broke ~~Though I swear I had a similar bug with wavy in the past...~~

(meta) thread name was changed: WarpEx issues

(replying to @ Moosh "If there's any other quest ru‚Ä¶"): Double checked this one, seems it was a ZASM issue of some sort. Recompiling that quest in the newest fixed the double wipe. So that's not an issue any more then

Oh? interesting

=== @ Moosh 06/15/2023 10:17

Wish I'd thought to backup before recompiling so I could compare. Darn

(if you can edit the original post with the new info, `~~text~~` does strikethrough)

=== @ Moosh 06/15/2023 10:19

done
All the issues mentioned in the OP were tested in...actually I guess I'm not on the latest nightly, but very recent
lemme go update now...

As for the passageway issue: #2457
instead of fixing the garbage with passageways/cellars, just let any warp type imitate their wipe style
then you can simply make manual passageway/cellar screens whose warping should work correctly since it's just a normal warp to a non-80 screen

=== @ Moosh 06/15/2023 22:33

Doing passageways, or worse yet item cellars, manually would get very confusing

=== @ Moosh 06/15/2023 22:35

Like for cases where you're planning on tens or hundreds of duplicate screens, screen 80 and 81 are actually a really good thing if you'd believe it
