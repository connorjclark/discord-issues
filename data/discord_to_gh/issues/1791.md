`Push->` triggers after pushing against it (same frames as push block timing) if solid.

`Light Beam->` since it is not an lweapon, I put it with "Other" (OR: add a flag and attribs to the Light Trigger combo type to not activate secrets, but level switch states)

=== @ Alucard648 08/01/2022 08:35

EWeapon->
Self Explanatory. Lure enemy into hitting trigger with his eweapon to activate.

=== @ vlamart 08/01/2022 08:37

Already requested, but as check boxes for each eweapon type

=== @ vlamart 08/11/2022 01:03

`Quake->` (from the hammer) trigger (min level determines normal or super, activates combos within the quake's `Stun Radius`)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/13/2022 00:16

invert checkbox for required item, 'consume' checkbox for required item

=== @ vlamart 08/13/2022 23:56

`Lens On->`
`Lens Off->`
Triggers for Lens of Truth being activated or not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/14/2022 13:53

~~Push->~~
~~Light Beam->~~
**EWeapon->**
**Quake->**
~~Invert Req. Item~~
~~Consume Req. Item~~
~~Lens On->~~
~~Lens Off->~~

=== @ vlamart 08/14/2022 14:15

Is ~~that~~ no or what is done?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/14/2022 14:15

what is done

Getting stuck in the wall is hilarious and I love that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/14/2022 14:32

And of course, you could have it only trigger when you turn on the lens / hit it with light, and *not* revert
Do note that solid things cannot be hit by light beams unless there is a `glass` combo in the same position (on any layer)
Here, either the orange walls could *be* glass combos themselves, or you could place invisible glass combos over all the orange walls
EWeapons is going to be a lot of work, which is why I've put it off
Quake I'm unsure if is worth adding

Dope 👏👏👏

=== @ vlamart 08/22/2022 19:27

After playing around with `Proximity`, I can't seem to make a combo that changes stepping off of it. Would that be a bug or should we add `Invert Step` (inverts respective step trigger)  to the Other triggers list?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2022 19:28

errr, step really isn't built to handle that
that would be like, extremely difficult
(replying to @ vlamart "After playing around with `Pr…"): Does a proximity of 16 not get close to what you're looking for?

=== @ vlamart 08/22/2022 19:30

Nope

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2022 19:30

what exactly is the problem with that, though?
need more details than just `nope`

=== @ vlamart 08/22/2022 19:31

Sorry, whether I set prox to 1 or 16, or invert it, if I start already standing on the combo, there is no change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2022 19:32

. . . ????
if it's 16, it should change when you are standing on it
if it's inverted, it should change when you are not
Do you have the combo change set up correctly?

=== @ vlamart 08/22/2022 19:35

Previous combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2022 19:43

so, if Link is 16 pixels away from the combo, it should become the previous....
OH
duh
proximity is not a trigger CAUSE
it is a trigger CONDITION
so, uh, set `Automatically Triggered` as well
err `Always Triggered`

=== @ vlamart 08/22/2022 19:46

That works, yay! 👏🧃🍪

`will trigger` vs `will only trigger`, different meanings
`will trigger` = `this causes it to trigger`
`will only trigger` = `this is a condition added to triggering by any other means`

=== @ vlamart 08/22/2022 19:50

That's not difficult to understand, but was easy to miss because I didn't even notice whether or not the word _only_ was there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2022 19:50

yep, easy to miss

=== @ vlamart 08/24/2022 00:45

To make a few more combo types and flags obsolete or redundant: `Enemies->` (if no enemies, trigger), `Secrets->` (if screen state secrets, trigger), and `Copycat (Trigger Only)` (if combo with the same trigger (combination does not matter) is triggered, so is this (in accordance to the copycat's effect)), `Copycat (Trigger & Effect)` (same as the other, but copies the same effects as the triggered combo)

=== @ vlamart 08/28/2022 17:40

Also for the Effects tab, `Change CSet` number box

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/28/2022 17:41

Surprised it took that long for that to be requested lol

=== @ vlamart 08/28/2022 17:43

Let's make generic combo type even more redundant and add `Spawn Sprite` and `Spawn Enemy` too (double whammy, enemies busting out of pots. Triple bonus, busting out of pots via proximity)

=== @ vlamart 08/28/2022 17:52

And `Spawn Item`:
0 > Dropset
0 <= specific Item
(Onus will be on quest maker to set the item flag for Special Item, for the item itself to only ever spawn once, I would assume same with enemies)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/28/2022 17:54

(replying to @ vlamart "And `Spawn Item`:
0 > Dropset…"): If the special item were not built in, it *wouldn't prevent the item spawn*

=== @ vlamart 08/28/2022 17:56

Oop, my next idea was to make it a check box, then if checked, the number box will un-grey. Then:
0 = Special Item
0 > Dropset
0 < specific Item

=== @ vlamart 08/29/2022 20:59

Also make `Secrets->Next` obsolete/redundant

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 12:20

`Spawn Item`
`Spawn Enemy`
`Enemies->`,`Secrets->`
`Trigger Copycat`
`Change CSet`
`ExState`

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 12:59

Also `Spawn Sprite` like smashing a pot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 13:05

bleh, you can probably just use one of the types that spawns sprites when broken

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 13:32

Then instead, maybe someway of adding the `Combo Change` value to `ComboType Effects` (or a new checkbox)? (E.g., slash grass, `+3` instead of just `next`)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 13:33

you... can already do that
just use the generic combo change
and combo type effects
the generic combo change takes priority if enabled

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 13:34

Oh, dope cool, then never mind 😊

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 13:37

basically, `combotype effects` is the first effect to occur
and change combo/change cset, store the combo ID before anything changes, and then use that for their change

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 13:55

Doprah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 13:56

OK, currently building a first test, which includes:
`CSet Change`
`Spawn Item` + (special item flag)
`Spawn Enemy`
`ExState` (linking the combo triggering to a screen ExState[] value)

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 13:58

Is it only triggered by `ExState[]`, or can it trigger an `ExState[]` too? (I guess that would be more appropriate for the `Switch` combo type)

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 13:59

Never mind, just remembered triggering `ExStates[]` is already a thing, and is in fact _the thing_

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 14:00

(replying to @ vlamart "Is it only triggered by `ExSt…"): It would trigger an ExState
and if that ExState is already triggered, the combo will trigger ONLY it's 'Combo Change' and 'CSet Change' attributes (i.e. won't do combotype effects, spawn item, spawn enemy, etc)
so, it's effectively an 'only trigger once' effect
It has a flag to not trigger the exstate until the spawned item is collected or the spawned enemy is killed, as well
so you can tie the behavior to the item or enemy itself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 14:04

Also, using this, you can change the exstate behavior of say, a lockblock, to do `+3` instead of `->Next`
as the generic exstate takes priority over the combo-specific exstate

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 14:44

bwahhahahaha
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "OK, currently building a firs…"): ^All works
That just leaves...
`Enemies->`
`Secrets->`
`Trigger Copycat`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 15:48

OK, `Copycat` works perfectly

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 16:21

Can you do conditional effects via scripting, like
```if(triggered by sword) combo change+1
else if(triggered by arrow) combo change+2```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 16:32

err, not really

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 16:35

Can there be?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 16:40

if you check the collision with sword/arrow/etc yourself, you could do this
using generic triggers, no

=== @ vlamart 08/31/2022 16:50

Ah, I was thinking for the more complicated triggers like light beam or lens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 18:01

https://youtu.be/gZv_0BciQ7E

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2022 18:04

I think that's everything I had listed here to add

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1003454389383594004/1014596700242980914/cmbtrigtest.qst?ex=65e8b04f&is=65d63b4f&hm=b094785535e698cba688847046993475c4fa45c4c2c05bfa86525b1bcf884e1f&

=== @ vlamart 09/02/2022 13:46

Another effect for redundancy, `Cooldown Timer`, a number box where the combo isn't able to be triggered until time is up (could also just be a check box or negative value that changes the timer behaviour)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2022 13:52

that's way too smart an idea
(sounds good, though nightly is already mid-post so not today)

=== @ vlamart 09/02/2022 13:55

Also, the kill weapon flag would still apply during the cooldown

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2022 15:52

cooldown works perfectly

=== @ vlamart 09/02/2022 15:53

👏👏👏

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2022 15:54

I just tested by making something trigger every frame and change it's cset by 1
and compared 0 cooldown to 60 cooldown... very easy to tell it works

=== @ vlamart 09/02/2022 16:00

STROBELITE

=== @ vlamart 09/02/2022 20:50

Does the cooldown delay combodata scripts? Could it be a QR?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2022 23:45

no, no
