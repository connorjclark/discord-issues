This is an issue I'm fairly certain *isn't* user error.

Basically, enhanced music (particularly OGG and MP3) is not starting at the correct point in the song. In my case, they tend to start a few seconds after the track is supposed to.

provide example quest that exhibits the issue please

Test the quest on Screen 35, Map 1. Head north into the castle. You'll notice the first second or so of the track is skipped.

Been looking at this, no luck so far.

Any idea if this happened in older alphas?
I did try changing the warp to Insta (no wipe) but that didn't matter.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 06:09

(meta) thread name was changed: mp3 starts couple seconds too late
(meta) thread name was changed: mp3 music skips first couple seconds

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 06:17

Same issue with some other mp3 I tried.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 06:36

107- not working

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 06:47

so allegro 5 didn't break this. the almp3 library seems to have a bug

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 07:07

almp3 was made by some guy we'll never know (who is Javier Gonzalez?). at some point Zoria added it here: https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/almp3 . References to this library from beginning of git repo, so it's been around a while.

anyway, it stole some decoder code from a project called mpg123 https://www.mpg123.de/api/mpglib_8c.shtml

I'm seeing the project has had many updates since 2000-whatever (as recent as last month). I didn't find a changelog but there is this:

> The old mpg123 versions contain various problems including security vulnerabilities. That doesn't mean that mpg123 is insecure and bad, this is just a result of aging code that lacks active maintainership.
> So please use these downloads with care and check the news section for known issues.
so bad stuff all around. this code is very bitrot

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 07:08

Author of the Allegro Legacy library has this simple example of using mpg123, but what looks like a much newer version: https://github.com/NewCreature/MP3A5

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 07:12

So has every mp3 ever in ZC had the first couple seconds skipped like this? Is this maybe just some types of mp3s?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 07:14

oooh someone added mp3 support to allegro 5 already: https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5/blob/master/addons/acodec/mp3.c

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 08:24

Got allegro 5's mp3 working. And it fixes this bug.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 08:28

Will post a test build. FYI @ Matthew please take a look when you have a chance.

=== @ Matthew 11/30/2022 13:01

Thank you @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) . I’ll take a look later today

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 17:55

The test build: https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-12-01

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/01/2022 06:33

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/01/2022 17:04

Planning to merge this later today

=== @ Matthew 12/02/2022 16:27
