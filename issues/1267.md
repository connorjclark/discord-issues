So as it is charge scrolls use their cost when you successfully charge up, not when you actually release the button to use the charged attack. This means that you can waste your magic on a spin attack or hammer quake without actually doing anything because you got hit after you charged but before you let go of the button.

With this item flag or QR the cost would only be subtracted when you let go of the button and the sword/hammer is swung.
