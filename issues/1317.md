this quest uses the "swap boss and non-boss fireball status" EWeapon script included with 2.55
you start with the mirror shield
screen 1 has a gleeok, screen 2 has an aquamentus, and screen 3 has both
the desired behaviour is that the gleeok's shots should reflect, while the aquamentus' do not
because the script is supposed to swap their boss/non-boss fireball status
oh so let's see here...
the gleeok is working on both screens
however, the aquamentus' fireballs are always reflectable even though they SHOULD be boss fireballs and the mirror shield does not reflect/block those

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 21:02

ok this is extremely weird

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 21:03

in THIS quest, i have added a gohma 3 to the 4th screen. its fireballs are swapped. i have changed the mirror shield flags to 8 for both block and reflect - reflect small fireballs ONLY. this still has the issue of the aquamentus fireballs being reflectable

however in THIS quest, the mirror shield is set to the exact same thing, the gohma is set to the exact same script, yet its fireballs are NOT blockable
(use cheat 4 to give yourself a mirror shield)
i have absolutely no idea what the difference is - i just cloned the gohma 3 enemy in my quest and gave it that eweapon script
should be identical to the gohma 3 in eweaponswap2.qst except for enemy # id

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:29

ok so issue here is that this script turns boss fireballs into normal fireballs (Gohma/Gleeok), but not vice versa (Aquamentus)
maybe i should just have two scripts, one that forces the fireball to be non-boss, and one that forces it to be boss, instead of the singular "toggle" script?
i'd be completely fine with that - no difference in gameplay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:30

The script isn't a toggle
It's based on the initd[0]
... you just left the initd at `0`, didn't you? @ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:34

Oh god damnit.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:34

lmfao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:34

It helps to actually look at how the literally 2-line script is set up...
the script is literally this:```cpp
eweapon script toggleBossFireball
{
    void run(bool enable)
    {
        if ( enable ) this->Level |= 1;
        else this->Level &= ~1;
    }
}```

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:35

I mean

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:35

So 0 InitD0 for an enemy = normal fireball, 1 InitD0 for boss?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:35

That isn't commented
at all

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:35

yeah i am seeing nothing there that refers to the enemy's weapon's InitD0 variable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:35

`void run(bool enable)`??

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:36

And what exactly the level is doing isn't immediately clear unless you're familiar with A: what bitwise looks like in code, and B: whether or not having a Level gives the boss fireball status or not

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:36

Oh I figured the Level set the status.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:36

You have a parameter `bool enable`
If it's true it's enabled
If it's false it's disabled

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:36

what is enabled? boss status being unset is enabled, or boss status being set is enabled?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:36

If you don't set it.....
Boss status enabled

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:37

Like, it's obvious for you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:37

Why would enabled disable the boss fireball?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:37

because you have the general "oh, this is how it works" figuring out knowledge

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:37

I figured because it was named "Toggle" that it flipped the boss fireball flag. So for Aquamentus it would give him boss fireballs, and for Gohma it would give her normal fireballs.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:37

The script name is "toggleBossFireball"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:37

Aye, probably a poor name

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:37

Like it would make them the opposite of normal.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:38

You're trying to argue smarts when most people default to unknowledgeable @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:38

Zoria doesn't know how to name shit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:38

Also ^

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:38

And I did read the script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:38

But regardless, the fact that `void run()` has a parameter means you have initd to set up
That's zscript 101

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:39

```if ( enable ) this->Level |= 1;
        else this->Level &= ~1;```
I read "if this weapon's level is unequal to 1 (so a boss fireball), change it to 1 (a normal fireball), and else (meaning it IS 1), add 1 to the weapon's level (to make it 2, a boss fireball)"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:39

```eweapon script toggleBossFireball
{
    void run()
    {
        this->Level ^= 1;
    }
}```
This would actually toggle it
er
there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:39

Aye

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:39

I might be giving ZScript too much credit to have bitwise Xor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:39

It does

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:40

okay, good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:40

It has *boolean* xor

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:40

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "```if ( enable ) this->Level…"): *fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:40

`6 ^^ 0 == true`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:41

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "```if ( enable ) this->Level…"): A fair accessment; I can't blame you for misreading that "if (enable)" as "if (this->Level)" or something similar

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:41

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "```if ( enable ) this->Level…"): The thing here is
The weapons level isn't in the if

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:41

I do shit like that all the time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:41

Its `if(enable)`

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:41

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "```eweapon script toggleBossF…"): Ok so I can use this script as I was misusing the prior script? It just toggles it like a light switch?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:41

So whatever `enable` is (here, InitD[0]) is the condition

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:41

Should be able to, yeah

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:41

Thanks, let me try

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:42

@ P-Tux7 also, helpful trick for future script debugging
``Trace(3);`` or etc
Place that down somewhere and have the zscript debugger open, and it'll print a 3 in the console when it's hit

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:43

Thanks!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:43

you can put any number in there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:43

Or variable

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:43

There's a string variant but I don't remember offhand what it is
And yeah
could put a variable in there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:43

`Trace(this->Level)`
`TraceB(enable)`
The `B` is for boolean, it'll print `true` or `false`
