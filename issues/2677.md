Would be nice to be able to temporarily alter Link's sprite depending on context for whatever tile is being walked on. The simplest use case would be for climbing ladders/vines, but it could also be used to give Link a different gait when in shallow water, tall grass, etc.
The modifier would only be in effect when the player is occupying that tile, similar to how you can set a footstep sfx / sfx to loop continuously

not fucking with tile modifiers on combos
that sounds like it'll be a big headache...
(if someone else feels up to it they're free to, but I'm not likely to add this myself)
