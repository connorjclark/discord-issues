So you know how we've all gotten used to changers being shown by a little flashing pixel in the upper left? That's a little strange isn't it? It can be a little hard to see at times. But also a lot of scripts run off an invisible FFC. It's tradition to hide those in the upper left corner, but it's still easy to lose track of them. So what I'd propose is a checkbox under the View dropdown that makes all FFCs more visible, drawing rectangular hiboxes around them.

This is really smart

Also clicking on FFC script list entry at the top left corner of editor should highlight FFC`s actual position and doubleclick opens FFC in editor.

That's a smart idea, though it'll cause a little bit of trouble for me when my scripts with long and goofy-ass names that reach across the screen start obstructing things

Also should maybe be disabled in small mode because there script names actually do fairly frequently cover portions of the screen. Portions where nothing much is happening but still enough for it to get irritating

Frankly it would make most sense to just draw a button to the left of the name
