Diagonal hookshot's grabbing collision is *very* off

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/04/2021 11:48

and whenever a hookshot post is grabbed, Link just gets moved upwards sometimes for no reason

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "and whenever a hookshot post…"): Oh goddamnit, I know what this is. The diagonal hookshot change made it so that Dir is no longer checked when checking your position relative to the hookshot
and it's just a simple if position is greater than hookshot head or position less then hookshot head

So New Hero Movement can cause buggy behavior with it because the decimal will throw it off

oh fun

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/04/2021 12:27

an Abs check should fix that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2021 12:27

?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/04/2021 12:29

Only do the thing if the difference between the two is equal to or greater than 1

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2021 12:31

ah, makes sense

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/04/2021 12:34

doesn't explain the wonky diagonal hookshot grabbing collision though

Diagonal bookshop is dead alpha and meant to be perfected in beta. I KNEW going in that it had flaws.  I asked for help and testers,  got none and put it on the backbench
The head and chain links work mostly right, q huge improvement over 2.futur3
But the actual angles and latching need fine tuning
