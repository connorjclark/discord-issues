Ive had that nightly crash 3 times thus far, twice relating to the boomerang returning to link, and once due to unknown causes. I haven't been successful in recreating the crashes in any other build thus far

=== @ THEMDODO 02/09/2023 22:54

When it crashed due to the boomerang, as soon as the item touched link, it crashed the game. I'm unsure if i had switched link's direction during that period or if an enemy died simultaneously.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/09/2023 23:00

Let me know if it happens with the most recent nightly. In the meantime, I'll explore again how to get crash reporting for Linux.

=== @ THEMDODO 02/09/2023 23:03

Alright. Ill make sure to let you know

=== @ THEMDODO 02/10/2023 18:45

It's happened again while i was testing out my quest, while i was exiting a cave using a sidewarp
I'm not sure if it's a memory issue on my end
Cause so far two crashes seem unrelated to the boomerang
And have happened when i had alot of stuff open
The boomerang ones didn't happen when i had alot open though

=== @ THEMDODO 02/10/2023 19:44

Ok it happened again i think its due to memory overload on my end

=== @ THEMDODO 02/11/2023 13:30

Ok i got it to happen again due to the boomerang
I managed to get a screenshot if that helps

It always seems to happen when it returns from the upper side of link

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/11/2023 17:28

Do you have access to a windows machine? If you can get it to happen there, we will get a crash report.

=== @ THEMDODO 02/11/2023 18:10

I'll try that

=== @ THEMDODO 02/12/2023 22:12

Ok it's done it again in a newer nightly
I'll try it on windows

=== @ THEMDODO 02/12/2023 22:15

This time it happened while i was using the hookshot

=== @ THEMDODO 02/12/2023 22:27

The windows version seems to work in wine. Does it still generate a crash report ?
If so,How do i get the crash report?

=== @ THEMDODO 02/12/2023 23:13

(meta) thread name was changed: Crashes in Nightly (linux build)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/12/2023 23:21

It's sent automatically

=== @ THEMDODO 02/12/2023 23:38

Ah i see

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2023 07:33

@ ~DodonArgustius~ any chance you can try to get this to crash on Windows by tomorrow evening? Looking to cut an alpha, would be nice to get a hint on where this crash is and fix it in time

=== @ THEMDODO 02/13/2023 11:03

I'll try

=== @ THEMDODO 02/14/2023 07:33

I've tried crashing it in the windows version but I've had no luck so far. It only seems to happen with the linux builds

=== @ THEMDODO 02/14/2023 07:34

Is there any way a crash report can  be generated in the linux builds?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/14/2023 15:10

Not yet

=== @ THEMDODO 02/15/2023 00:20

Oof

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/15/2023 08:26

Next nightly (~25min) will have crash reporting on linux, please get it to crash with that

=== @ THEMDODO 02/15/2023 18:26

Alright I'll try it out

=== @ THEMDODO 02/15/2023 18:59

I've noticed that the linux build is significantly bigger now than the other builds

=== @ THEMDODO 02/15/2023 19:00

Why is that the case?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/15/2023 19:02

dumb bug with symlinks
thanks for letting me know

=== @ THEMDODO 02/15/2023 19:59

Oof
I've been trying it out and it hasn't crashed thus far
Or even drop in frames (it usually drops before it crashes)

=== @ THEMDODO 02/15/2023 20:01

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "thanks for letting me know"): Sure

=== @ THEMDODO 02/15/2023 20:03

I think ill try launching the executable in my terminal. Im not sure, but usually when i test out my allegro programs if it crashes due to a memory access violation it returns a segmentation fault. That might help if this version doesn't crash. Thus far it seems to be working pretty well
I'll fiddle around more with the new versiom then try that
Strange how it seemingly crashes randomly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2023 18:56

Any update?

=== @ THEMDODO 02/18/2023 23:41

No crashes so far
Tried the other versions as well nothing yet
It crashes whenever it feels like it for some reason

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/30/2023 00:10

Guess the bug got squashed one way or another ü§∑
