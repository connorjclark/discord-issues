``Player/Hero/Link->InputAxisRight`` and ``Input->Button[CB_AXIS_RIGHT]`` always return true even if no directional inputs are made.
This is not an issue with their ``Press`` variants

Despite using a controller, the opposite seems true: it's always false for me it seems
all of them are always false
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I'm unsure if this even works at all
