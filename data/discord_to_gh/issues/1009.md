Not sure if this is a "bug" per se or some sort of intended behavior, but when you set the screen midi on guy caves, it still doesn't play. I can't think of any advantage to this behavior; it'd be neat to be able to set music in a guy cave.

...I'm not sure whether it works or not in Item Cellars and Passageways? I forgot to test that before I posted this

Gonna guess it reads from the main screen, not screen 80
Screen 80+ shit is jank as fuck

ah
For what it's worth, scripts _can_ use Game->PlayMIDI() and Game->PlayEnhancedMusic() on those screens without issue
