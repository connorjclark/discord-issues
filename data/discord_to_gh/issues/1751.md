When reading a read-only file display (such as viewing `zstrings.txt` via the `Help` button in the string editor), you cannot type anything; but pressing keys, despite not typing anything, scrolls you to the cursor position. Only the arrow keys should be valid (as they allow you to move the cursor), as well as other scrolling keys such as PgUp/PgDn; any other keys should NOT cause a scroll.
