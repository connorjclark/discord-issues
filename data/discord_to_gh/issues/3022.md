Title. They ain't moving

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/28/2024 19:34

Script?
I don't really know offhand how to spawn a fairy, which means I can't just start debugging this right now.

=== @ Moosh 01/28/2024 19:46

Made a test script and they seem to be schmovin just fine

(replying to @ mitchfork "Title. They ain't moving"): gonna need a test

=== @ mitchfork 01/28/2024 20:25

(replying to @ Moosh "Made a test script and they s…"): Can you post the script? Can't open the quest rn

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/28/2024 20:26

(replying to @ mitchfork "Can you post the script? Can'…"): he said that the fairies are working properly in his test
meaning he doesn't have the issue, only you do so far

=== @ mitchfork 01/28/2024 20:26

I'm aware
That's why I want to see his script to see if there's any differences

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/28/2024 20:28

ah, makes sense
```
#include "std.zh"

ffc script Fairy
{
    void run()
    {
        itemsprite itm = CreateItemAt(34, this->X, this->Y);
    }
}```

both the placed and spawned fairy move
~~though @ Moosh that test IS in `3.0` not `2.55`, so theoretically possible its a 2.55-only issue from something not backported?~~
~~I don't think it particularly *likely*, but possible~~

=== @ Moosh 01/28/2024 20:30

Is it 3.0? O.o It shouldn't be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/28/2024 20:31

err wait
brain dumb
(My RelWithDebInfo was the one erroring, which was last compiled in 2.55)
(but brain dumb... it was giving me the error loading the last open quest, not your quest, 🤦‍♀️)

=== @ mitchfork 01/28/2024 21:27

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "```
#include "std.zh"

ffc sc…"): Hmm, okay
I am setting a pickup flag, IP_TIMEOUT
There may be some other stuff I'm doing too. Would have to diagnose further but probably not a bug then

=== @ mitchfork 01/29/2024 02:34

....ah
It's because I'm using `itemsprite->Misc[]` for arbitrary data storage....
and `Misc[]` is also `Attributes[]` for itemsprites 🙃

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/29/2024 02:36

...what?
`itemsprite->Misc` should be fine
`itemdata->Misc[]` is the attributes

=== @ mitchfork 01/29/2024 02:37

oh that wasn't it??
ugh, more debugging needed

=== @ mitchfork 01/29/2024 02:39

....it's this
`fairy->Pickup |= IP_TIMEOUT;`
this causes the fairy not to move
which was not always the case for 2.55

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/29/2024 02:40

huh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/29/2024 02:41

I don't have a specific reason to suspect this, but can you try running with `[zeldadx] optimize_zasm = 0` in zc.cfg?

=== @ mitchfork 01/29/2024 02:41

flag behavior is disabled (as default) in editor
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I don't have a specific reaso…"): if I add this it should affect test mode too right?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/29/2024 02:41

yup

=== @ mitchfork 01/29/2024 02:43

no effect

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/29/2024 02:43

yay (for me lol)

(meta) thread name was changed: [2.55] Moving Fairies spawned via script with IP_PICKUP do not move

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/01/2024 00:20

I made a test qst with

```c
#include "std.zh"

ffc script Fairy
{
    void run()
    {
        itemsprite itm = CreateItemAt(34, this->X, this->Y);
        itm->Pickup |= IP_TIMEOUT;
    }
}
```

but the fairy moves. @ mitchfork am I missing something?

=== @ mitchfork 02/01/2024 03:28

Hmmm
Let me try again in the latest nightly in a bit

=== @ mitchfork 02/02/2024 19:00

this still occurs for me, and removing the `IP_TIMEOUT` line does make it move. But it's buried in a boss death function, let me try just the ffc script

=== @ mitchfork 02/02/2024 19:03

yeah, this script has the exact same behavior. But now I have a hunch that there's some confounding thing going on...

=== @ mitchfork 02/02/2024 19:10

Yeah, ignore the `IP_TIMEOUT` thing. That's a red herring - it's making it findable by another script that's handling an item magnetism effect
```const int MAGNETITEM_VMISC = 8;
const int MAGNETITEM_ANGLEMISC = 9;

const int MAGNETITEM_RANGE = 96;
const int MAGNETITEM_MAXSPEED = 2;
const int MAGNETITEM_ACCEL = 0.025;

void itemMagnet() {
    for(int i=1;i<=Screen->NumItems();i++){
        item itm = Screen->LoadItem(i);
        if(GetItemPickup(itm,IP_TIMEOUT)){
            //Modify attraction values
            if ((Distance(itm->X,itm->Y,Hero->X,Hero->Y) <= MAGNETITEM_RANGE) and (JEFF[JEFF_ITEMATTRACT])) {
                itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC] = Min(itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC]+MAGNETITEM_ACCEL,MAGNETITEM_MAXSPEED);
                itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_ANGLEMISC] = Angle(itm->X,itm->Y,Hero->X,Hero->Y);
            } else {
                itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC] = Max(itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC]-MAGNETITEM_ACCEL,0);
            }
            
            //Handle Movement
            itm->X += VectorX(itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC],itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_ANGLEMISC]);
            itm->Y += VectorY(itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC],itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_ANGLEMISC]);
        }
    }
}```
This script is what's doing it. And I've "fixed" it but don't know if this is still a bug... it's these two lines:
```            itm->X += VectorX(itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC],itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_ANGLEMISC]);
            itm->Y += VectorY(itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC],itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_ANGLEMISC]);```
seems like setting the fairy's X/Y like this disables the engine movement for that frame
So if I wrap it like this ```            if (itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC]) {
                itm->X += VectorX(itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC],itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_ANGLEMISC]);
                itm->Y += VectorY(itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC],itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_ANGLEMISC]);
            }```
Then that fixes my issue
(replying to @ mitchfork "seems like setting the fairy'…"): But it feels like this shouldn't really happen?
so I dunno. you may consider this a bug or not, it's resolved enough for my purposes though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 10:44

(replying to @ mitchfork "So if I wrap it like this ```…"): This stumps me. You're certain about this?
Can you set us up with the qst/scripts to compile?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2024 10:45

I'd expect those methods to evaluate to zero when the length is zero, so the conditional shouldn't make a difference

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2024 06:28

It's ummmm
quite a big script setup
I could try to isolate the problem things

            Waitdraw();            
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
This is all inside the ZScript buffer...
```            //Handle Movement
            //if (itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC]) {
                itm->X += VectorX(itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC],itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_ANGLEMISC]);
                itm->Y += VectorY(itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_VMISC],itm->Misc[MAGNETITEM_ANGLEMISC]);
            //}```
As set up, this induces the bug. You'll have to get out of range of the magnet effect but when out of range the fairy is frozen
If you un-comment this if() statement, it will cause the fairy to move normally when outside of magnet range

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/06/2024 06:45

Thanks for narrowing it, I'll take a look tomorrow.

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2024 06:49

(This is Jan 30 build at this point)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/07/2024 00:46

well _that's_ a thing to look into

```
case ITEMX:
    if(0!=(s=checkItem(ri->itemref)))
    {
        (s->x)=get_qr(qr_SPRITEXY_IS_FLOAT) ? zslongToFix(value) : zfix(value/10000);
        
        // Move the Fairy enemy as well.
        if(itemsbuf[((item*)(s))->id].family==itype_fairy && itemsbuf[((item*)(s))->id].misc3)
            movefairynew2(((item*)(s))->x,((item*)(s))->y,*((item*)(s)));
    }
```
setting this has special behavior for fairy

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/07/2024 00:48

lol only that last cast to item* is needed
however it doesnt do anything interesting

```
// Move guy with item (used by FFC scripts and hookshot-dragged fairies)
void movefairynew2(zfix x,zfix y, item const &itemfairy)
{
    enemy *fairy = (enemy *) guys.getByUID(itemfairy.fairyUID);
    
    if(fairy)
    {
        fairy->x = x;
        fairy->y = y;
    }
}
```

so hard to see how this would prevent the engine doing its own thing with the fairy

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/07/2024 01:03

i think i got it
the item fairy sprite ... has a guy sprite associated with it
these are distinct game objects
when setting item x you actually write to the guy x (in addition to the item x)...
but when reading item x... you get the item x
the animation logic that moves the fairy is on the guy
so it gets blown out every frame

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2024 01:06

...timing issue, yay

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/07/2024 01:06

lets see if we can just read from the guy?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2024 01:06

That'd probably work

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/07/2024 01:14

what should happen if cannot find a enemy sprite for the fairy?
return 0, return -bigoffsecreennumber, return item x? should an error be logged?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2024 01:17

item probably safest

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/07/2024 01:29

fixed!

@ Moosh is the notification a ... fairy item?

=== @ Moosh 02/07/2024 02:28

no???
It's spawning an item and moving it to the player's position every frame. is that related?

weirdddd
https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/commit/50189ca23f72c9014add2ffd0afe48c32bd5262a

the fact that only stellar seas and yuurand failed tells me we need way more replays of script heavy quests
