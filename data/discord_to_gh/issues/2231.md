Mitch's question of how to make a jump button inspired this.

Options in the "Game Data" settings for the A, B, X, and Y buttons for whatever class of items to be forced to use in that slot. For example, if you select Swords in the A button, only that itemclass can be used on the A button. This can be used to, say, simulate the original Zelda 1 limitation of the Sword on the A button, or have one of the buttons be for Roc-Class items to have a "jump button". This is especially good for sideview areas and quests.

Setting the fields to "None" keeps the original behaviour of allowing the player to select which item they will use in thaf slot. This means that there is no QR governing this. Simply set the fields to "None" to disable this behaviour and anything else to enable it. All imported quests will set these fields to "None" as well.

To avoid weirdness and glitches, this enforces the Zelda 1 limitation of how not only is the item automatically placed in its slot for use when you obtain one of its class, but also that you CANNOT assign other items to any itemclass-reserved buttons even before you obtain an item of the reserved itemclass. For example, if you have the Sword mapped to A, you can't get Bombs and go to the subscreen and press A on the Bombs to assign them to the A-button slot. That slot is simply unavailable for use besides Sword-class items.

This might also be a good time to implement a "buzz" sound similar to LTTP which could be used in such a scenario to show how your choice was rejected. More on that in another feature request

I'd like to point out how this doesn't involve the Subscreen Editor at all, just Game Data in ZQuest and the gameplay code

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/13/2023 18:09

Bleh, this sounds difficult

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:19

I'll claim this for later

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:27

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "I'll claim this for later"): I would recommend Init Data as the dialog for this, and if you're gonna go all out:
-checkbox for each button being assignable on the subscreen or not
-checkbox for each button being USABLE or not
-dropdown for each item's "forced itemclass", with a (None) option for a free use button
this would need to like, replace the existing QRs though?
so it would need a bunch of qst.cpp forwarding stuff

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:31

Ideally it should be per-active subscreen, and specifically for item slots instead of classes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:32

ü§¢
*Veto*
active subscreen
fuck
god
why
no
jank
fuckery
that's.... pain
and then all the code related to handling anything to do with items
would have to be tied into the active subscreen
so, unless you are planning on ***completely rewriting active subscreens, IN THEIR ENTIRETY, from SCRATCH***, that's a big no

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:33

I'd make it a checkbox on the active item subscreen object for each button; if you have more than one for a button then it grabs the highest levelled one (or if equal, the first or last object it finds); this would let you have multiple characters
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "would have to be tied into th‚Ä¶"): they already are though?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:33

????
No they aren't
they are qrs
everything currently related to this is qrs

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:34

you forcibly unequip any item you don't have in the current subscreen when changing subscreens
so the code for this is already there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:34

....bleh, that.... ok, you know, that's fair
but
like
you're talking about
adding a ton of stuff to the actual subscreen editor itself
and tying it in a lot more
which is really really really the EXACT OPPOSITE of what we should be doing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:35

I don't see a problem with it? Not everyone's going to script a subscreen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:35

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "you forcibly unequip any item‚Ä¶"): and, this has to do with what items are available to equip, but

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:35

the entire point of the subscreen editor is to make it so you don't *have* to script a subscreen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:35

NOT A SINGLE THING to do with what item buttons are available, or forcing the sword on A, has ANYTHING  to do with the subscreen
so you would be tying all of that in as well
and also you can't really just forward the existing rules to all the subscreens in that way
it wouldn't work compat wise
and could break existing 2.55 quest, or would need to be behind a compat rule, which then would make several things VERY janky
I really do not want this on the engine subscreen unless you intend on rewriting engine subscreens entirely

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:37

if rewriting them makes it easier for me, then I'll do that. otherwise I'll do it in whatever way I find sane

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:37

engine subscreens are already far to jank spaghetti to try tangling more spaghetti into them

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:37

It's not like you're going to be touching engine subscreens to care, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:37

I have had to
and if you don't completely rewrite them
then I'll probably be the one
forced to entirely rewrite them
so I'll end up very much caring
This really belongs in Init Data
This is something I feel quite strongly about
I do not want engine subscreens getting any more spaghetti fuckery

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:38

and I feel quite strongly that they should be tied to active subscreens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:39

We should take time to discuss this at some point

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:39

I'm likely not touching this until after June 6th

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:39

like, not in text walls
Also, if it's in engine subscreens, scripts can't touch it at all
if it's in Init Data, scripts have full access
and, if it's in Init Data, you can even let Cheats change it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:41

(mayhaps @ P-Tux7 can contribute an opinion?)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:42

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "if it's in Init Data, scripts‚Ä¶"): okay, fair. Honestly though that points more to "scripts should be able to modify the engine subscreen", which... ew, but it needs to be done at *some* point.
on the other hand

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:43

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "okay, fair. Honestly though t‚Ä¶"): That isn't happening until the engine subscreen is *completely rewritten from scratch*
I have looked into the idea
it is NOT good
engine subscreens badly need a full redesign
....which, if it is done in 2.55, needs to somehow maintain compat?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:43

if it's in Init Data, then you can't have forced items per dmap, or have multiple forced item classes in a slot without a script

=== @ P-Tux7 05/23/2023 14:44

yeah i would like to say
this really, really isn't a priority or in fact anything i even need for a quest

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:44

both of which feel like they should be in-engine, and not something you *need* a script for

=== @ P-Tux7 05/23/2023 14:44

i think at the time of requesting it i was under the impression roc items didn't allow you to hardcode them to a button

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:44

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "both of which feel like they‚Ä¶"): ....why do these feel like they should be in-engine?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:44

multiple characters

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:45

multiple characters is something that generally requires scripts to pull off

=== @ P-Tux7 05/23/2023 14:45

which solves the "jump button" problem for sideview i outlined in the original post, so i'm pretty much good

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:45

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "multiple characters is someth‚Ä¶"): Rosemaster
Glory Squad

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:45

(I don't know those quests, how did they do it?)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:45

you just need SCCs or dmap shenanigans

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:45

SCC: Change Forced Itemslot

=== @ P-Tux7 05/23/2023 14:45

they used SCCs, map shenanigans and LTMs, yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:46

`\whatever\0,1,2,3 for a,b,x,y\itemclass to force`
sccs can be added if such is needed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:46

okay, that makes sense.
really though this just makes me want to rewrite engine subscreen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:46

there are ways to fix problems like this that aren't "tie it to the janky existing engine subscreen"
tying anything to the existing engine subscreen is LITERALLY a ***last resort***

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:47

if it being the way it is is such a huge hassle where it can't be touched and users hate having to use it, then maybe it needs to be rewritten sooner rather than later

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:47

Rewriting the engine subscreen to be better, would absolutely be a good thing, though
it does need to happen at some point
the major problem is, trying to do it ***without breaking compat*** makes it like, at least twice as hard of a task

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:48

Like, you should be able to drag subscreen objects with the mouse

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:48

That entire dialog needs to be rewritten in the new GUI system
which, requires creating a metric fuckton of new widgets for the new gui system
because that entire thing is old gui dialog array bullshit
(I handled the properties dialog, which only needed like 2-3 new widgets, because that was managable)
(the main thing is PAIN)
Also, frankly
Multiple PAGES should be an engine feature, if we are going proper rewrite
i.e. L/R cycles through pages re: OOT,MM

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:49

absolutely yes!
I was going to add that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:50

and, the cursor should be able to highlight passive items
and display their current item name
without allowing them to be equipped
which, would need a new subscreen widget type

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:50

which goes back to "can be equipped to A/B/X/Y" flags for active item objects

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:50

also, a widget that lets the cursor select it and displays an *arbitrary string* as the current item name would also be good, to like, let you hover over a triforce frame and have it say that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:51

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "which goes back to "can be eq‚Ä¶"): If you're doing that, make sure there's a button to toggle all 4 checkboxes at once
for convenience

=== @ P-Tux7 05/23/2023 14:52

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the major problem is, trying‚Ä¶"): can there just be two subscreen systems? that's absolutely sucky code/script/GUI/quest data-wise, but allows for a clean break
no having to implement all the current subscreen's junk, no having to convert current subscreens to a new format...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:55

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "can there just be two subscre‚Ä¶"): I mean, yes, there's a lot of jank involved in that too though
see: old/new enemy tiles
with old/new dropdowns
old/new animations
etc etc

=== @ P-Tux7 05/23/2023 14:56

that's fair
like i said i don't really care about this now that lift gloves and roc items have the functionality
now deedee as for the enemy editor ü§§

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/23/2023 14:58

right... I need to rewrite that *again*.
assuming I didn't push it; in which case I need to shift through merge conflicts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 15:00

big oof

=== @ vlamart 05/26/2023 10:57

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "without allowing them to be e‚Ä¶"): This would also be neat for items that can only be used in the active subscreen (like eating food in botw)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/26/2023 11:01

yeah, if we're doing new subscreen stuff, adding a `RunFrozen Generic Script` option would let you do some basic scripted stuff on pressing a button

=== @ cbailey78 05/26/2023 15:29

Maybe Elon Musk could easily rewrite the subscreen!
