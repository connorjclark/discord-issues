A mode for Relational Combos and Dungeon Carving that uses 13 combos for each. Something like this, with the middle, the four corners and compass directions, and inside/outside corners.

We need proper documentation for setting up combos for relational and cungeon carving modes.

=== @ Moosh 01/02/2023 14:13

While 13 combos seems like limitatingly few, I am interested in the idea of a simpler carving mode. The existing ones have confusing layouts and too many combos, but the question is, how to strike the ideal balance

=== @ Moosh 01/02/2023 14:16

Also kinda wanna make a GB mountain carving mode at some point.

The documentation about this relational/carving feature has been loooooong overdue!  It's no wonder I've seen any use with this amazing feature since it came about over a decade.  It takes so many combos like you said, time consuming to set up and  just too complex.  This simpler like RPG Maker style would be a god send.  I doubt it would be possible for dev's to program such thing into Zquest besides a rewrite. 

Perhaps implement a 4 section tile (8x8 pixel) setup into a combo first, then it would be more possible.

this would be awesome for something like GB walls, or one tile high walls, but you'd still be missing out on some the weird corner edge cases (no pun intended) if corners were adjacent to each other. I'll just post a screen of what I mean since explaining it is not my strong suit. That said, I'd be willing to live with that, if it meant a simpler set up

=== @ Anthus 01/06/2023 02:10

use cases like this is what I meant:

=== @ Anthus 01/06/2023 02:11

and you could also design screens not not have walls be one tile wide, or if you must,  just go back over them with some tiles on layer 1 if you needed to (which is what is needed anyway with these particular tiles)

=== @ Anthus 01/06/2023 02:16

... you know, I kind of just realized, what I described is exactly how relational mode works now. oop

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2023 04:28

yeah i'd be willing to have to manually polish those in exchange for using a simpler mode
it'd still beat actually *placing* every tile like you do in the game boy tilesets

=== @ P-Tux7 01/06/2023 04:29

i view it like the "random combo from a list brush" that Emily made, where that brush gives you the screen's basic framework quicker and you polish it manually

=== @ Anthus 01/06/2023 05:38

ideally what I'd do with this style is, have all borders be relational mode draws on layer 1 then just put the rest of the "walls" on layer 0

=== @ Anthus 01/06/2023 05:39

and if I recall right, there is a template for dungeon carving, and relational drawing modes, in classic, but it's uhh, yeah not always the most intuitive to copy and paste over.

=== @ Anthus 01/06/2023 05:41

that said, I'd always be down for a simpler relational drawing mode, so this is still a valid feature request imo

=== @ Alucard648 01/13/2023 07:01

Here is my variant of relational and dungeon carving template. If hard to understand, tell here.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/13/2023 20:43

It's not so much of it being complicated, but rather having to draw so many tiles and for situations in which I would not use it often.

=== @ Alucard648 01/14/2023 03:03

Here we go - Wall building and dungeon carving template for GB tilesets. Uses only 15 different tiles.
