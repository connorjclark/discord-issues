In Yuurand specifically, lock blocks on layer 2 no longer work on the newest nightly. They work in alpha 107. Per jman, the new lockblock logic no longer checks on layers. The old lock block collision rule should be enabled automatically for older quests, preserving the old behaviour, but this does not seem to be happening
Relevant conversation snippit
11:31 PM] jman2050: yeah I'm looking at the github
[11:32 PM] jman2050: looks like Emily overhauled lock blocks (among other things) about three weeks ago, then set up a quest rule if the old behavior is wanted
[11:32 PM] jman2050: notably, in the new logic it doesn't check for layers at all
[11:32 PM] jman2050: as far as I can tell
[11:33 PM] jman2050: the old function checks for valid lock block combos on layers 0,1, and 2 as was standard
[11:33 PM] Russ: Ah...
[11:33 PM] Russ: Okay, then lemme just go ahead and make a bug report for this right now
[11:34 PM] jman2050: for now, just setting that quest rule on should fix any issues with Yuurand 
[11:34 PM] Russ: Which rule?
[11:34 PM] jman2050: it's called Old Lockbock Collision or something like that
[11:34 PM] jman2050: it's a quest rule
[11:34 PM] Russ: Wait, is this a new 2.55 rule?
[11:34 PM] Russ: Yuurand's saved in 2.53, so that rule SHOULD be set by default when it's played in 2.55 
[11:35 PM] Russ: So the issue might be that that rule is not being properly set for older quests
[11:35 PM] jman2050: possibly
[11:35 PM] jman2050: still, having certain combo behaviors on layers 0-2 can be useful, so this should be evaluated anyhow
[11:35 PM] jman2050: as far as the new behavior goes

huh, ok, I'm very confused now

because it most certainly IS being enabled for old quests on this very line

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/09/2022 11:25

....and also
with the rule ON, it looks like it should work on `0,1,2`
with the rule OFF, it should work on `0,1,2,3,4,5,6`
so there is no case in which it should not work on layers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/09/2022 11:30

OH
I think I see what's wrong
bleh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/09/2022 11:31

there's an off-by-one error
so it's trying to trigger the lockblock one layer lower than it's placed on
and it only does that *with the compat rule ON*
so, it definitely is enabling it properly if you're having issues

(replying to @ Russ "In Yuurand specifically, lock…"): For the record, you could have opened the quest file in ZQuest and checked if the rule was enabled, which it in fact would have been

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "there's an off-by-one error"): wait, nope, that's not what's wrong
that fucking variable is never used
fuck
...oh
oh
it's even stupider
Fixed.

there was a 1-letter typo in a variable name... which happened to be a valid different variable name of the same type.

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅Lock blocks no longer work on layers 1 and 2 in older quests

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "there was a 1-letter typo in…"): Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa this is what my nightmares look like
Thanks for fixing it!
