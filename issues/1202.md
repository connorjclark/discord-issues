1. Do Not Drop Bomb Item When Killed While Stunned by an Explosion - does not drop the 4 bombs item (whatever ID that is) when killed while stunned by explosion smoke
2. Do Not Drop Super Bomb Item When Killed While Stunned by a Super Explosion - same but for super bomb explosions
3. Do Not Auto-Drop Super Bombs If Killed By Eating One - does not drop (default super bomb item #) if it eats one and this depletes its HP and it dies. So you can't "recycle" the one Super Bomb.
4. Use Choking Frames While Stunned - uses the choking frames while stunned by an explosion. Visual indicator to let you know you can hit it

(todo: list whatever IDs 4bombs and super bomb are hardcoded to be)

it might also be worth it to add an option to change its auto-drops by entering an item # instead of them being hardcoded. but that could be costly

ok so apparently the dodongo drops use hardcoded dropset #s
instead of item #s
