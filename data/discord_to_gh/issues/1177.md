=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:35

so, lets put some ideas down in text
One itemclass
Attribute 1 is which bottle "slot" to use, limited to some max number
Tile displayed is offset by the *contents* of the "slot", similarly to how 4-dir sprites are offset by their dir value

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:56

New room type; "Bottle Shop". 3 slots. Select for each slot: A combo (for visual), a Cost (to buy), and a Value (the bottle-fill value to fill a bottle with).

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:57

Another itemclass, "Bottle Filler". When picked up, fills the first empty bottle with a value from an attribute. Bottle shops allow you to fill bottles *without needing bottle filler items for every possible fill*, but Bottle Fillers can be placed in normal shops, or dropped in dropsets, etc. In a normal shop, bottle fillers need special handling to not allow buying without an empty bottle; would act as though you don't have enough money, just not letting you buy it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:00

Bottle fill values:
`0 = empty`
`1 = Red Potion` - heals health to full
`2 = Green Potion` - heals magic to full
`3 = Blue Potion` - heals both health and magic to full
??? Any other ideas for engine ones?
and after all the engine ones, 50 script ones, which do absolutely nothing; but an Action script on a bottle could be used to give them purpose. Why 50? Well why the fuck *not* 50?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:10

Makes perfect sense
Uh... hmm
Having customizeable heal values would be good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:10

well, where would that be stored?
can't be on the item, as it's not associated with the particular item
so that would need a whole new editor of some sort
which would be *blehg*
using a script one as a custom healing value would be dead-easy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:12

Milk
has two servings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:13

k, so
`4 = Milk (2)` - heals health to full, becomes state 5 afterwards
`5 = Milk (1)` - heals health to full, empties afterwards

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:13

I wouldn't even heal health to full; I'd go with 5 hearts
That's the value OoT goes with

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:14

ahk, sure

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:14

Gives it use as an early game healing/when you have limited bottles, but has it fall off later when you get more than 10 hearts and just want a good full heal

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:15

```cpp
itemdata script EmptyBottle
{
    void run()
    {
        int bstate = this->Attributes[0];
        if(bstate < 0 || bstate >= NUM_BOTTLE_STATES)
             return; //bad bottle state
        switch(Game->BottleStates[bstate])
        {
            case BSTATE_SCRIPT1:
            {
                Game->DCounter[CR_LIFE] += 8*Game->Generic[GEN_HP_PER_HEART];
                Game->BottleStates[bstate] = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}```
there's an example of how a script would work

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:15

Makes sense, yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:15

that makes the `Script 1` state heal 8 hearts
then become empty

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:16

I'd also have a flag for "gives positive drain" (with a better name of course)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:16

?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:16

As in, instead of just setting your health or doing the slow health crawl, it sets the drain value to fill up that many hearts or magic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:17

that wouldn't be a flag

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:17

(basically, a gradual refill for polish)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:17

that'd just be how it does it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:17

Ah, yeah
Fairy in a bottle
can't forget the iconic classic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:18

oh, of course
...which means adding a way to *catch fairies*
questioning then which method is better, LTTPs or Moosh's
a bug net item, or just using an empty bottle swings it
....probably a bug net item

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:20

okay, cursed idea: ghini/poe in a bottle
caught the same way you catch fairies

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:21

and add the use table from Majora's
sounds fun
flag on bug net would make it easy
another reason to make it a separate item, so it can have such flags, instead of needing to set that on each bottle

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:21

yuup

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:23

either heals a portion of Link's health, or reduces him to just a quarter heart

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:25

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) bottled firefly
acts as a lantern item while you have one in your bottle

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:26

....interesting, but that would require a passive scan of every bottle every frame, and where would it get the lantern attributes from?
could be done with a script, once I allow direct access to the darkness bitmaps (still to-do)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:28

Elixir Soup: Acts as a double use blue potion, and gives you the effects of a double-damage attack ring until you take damage
...why did Nintendo have this? This completely makes the potions irrelevant

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:29

blehg

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:31

they reduced it to single use in Twilight Princess (in the form of the great fairies tears)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:31

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....interesting, but that wou…"): this could be saved on by only performing the check while inside a room with darkness maybe?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:31

well, yeah, sure
but still
> and where would it get the lantern attributes from?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:32

though i'm unsure how the lantern interacts with z1 dark rooms
true

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:32

it does not interact with old dark rooms
but new dark rooms are default

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:32

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "> and where would it get the…"): Init Data?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:32

🤢

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:32

Yeah, not a good solution

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:32

frankly, it's an interesting idea

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:32

and what would happen if you release it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:32

but it's more one that I would see being scripted, than engine

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:33

It'd be neat to see as a script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:33

have a scripted npc for a firefly, and hitting it with a bug net catches it into an empty bottle
then either you could do scripted draws to the darkness, once I add that
....or you could just add a hidden lantern item, and remove it if you release the firefly....
which would be far saner

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:34

if you go with a scripted NPC, you could use the NPC for determining the light radius
cause maybe some fireflies are better than others

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:34

aye, and the script could store that info for each bottle, and use the largest one you have
these are all perfect reasons why that would make a good *script* rather than *engine option*
would certainly be cool

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 06:35

If you ever implement these bottles, I'll probably release a day one script that does that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:35

and that's why I wanted to add like 50 script slots, so scripts have room to do whatever the fuck

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:36

script the good bee from lttp but make it have a light radius and follow you across screens
muahahaha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:18

clearing the off-topic discussion

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 07:18

yeah, I figured
I'm just being a shitter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:19

So, bottles ain't happening tonight, because
but, I very much like this idea

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 07:19

I wasn't aware tonight was even on the table lmfao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:19

definitely something to keep on my list

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 00:05

OK, so new idea
because I'm just crazy enough
A bottle contents editor menu
where you can set each bottle contents to have a name
as well as 3 counter dropdowns
a number (`word` size) for how much to refill of said counter
with a checkbox for each for `is %`
and another textbox which is `After drinking, become...`
this would need a new script variable type for accessing these, along with all the shit that requires
and, the `After drinking, become...` would take effect *after* the action script on the bottle item, to allow scripted effects

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 00:10

so, think:
```
1. Red Potion
Life: 100 (%)
None 0
None 0
Become 0

2. Green Potion
Magic: 100 (%)
None 0
None 0
Become 0

3. Blue Potion
Life: 100 (%)
Magic: 100 (%)
None 0
Become 0

4. Milk (2)
Life: 80
None 0
None 0
Become 5

5. Milk (1)
Life: 80
None 0
None 0
Become 0```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 00:12

....now, as for fairies, perhaps another checkbox for `Auto-Use On Death`
Bug Net would have a flag for `Can catch fairies`, and fairy items would have an attrib for `Bottle Fill`, to know which it stores as

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 00:45

i wonder if we should recycle the sword class for bug nets?
maybe add the auto-swirl behaviour flag and a can catch fairies flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 00:45

🤢
nothing about the sword
no
sword bad
sword bad
sword dies
no

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 06:58

K, so I'm officially insane

...gui only has the titlebar done thus far, but I have the backend storage for all the data laid out in zdefs already
also note that `?` button on the titlebar?
and also that the `?` and `X` both are using the actual font color that stands out enough in dark mode?
So, I added the `?` as part of `jwin_win_proc`, just like the X; and fixed the color while I was at it
`jwin_win_proc` now uses `dp3`, as a `char const*` pointing to help text
if the dp3 is non-null, then the `?` button will be displayed
and clicking it....

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909677871423950930/910061826383945738/unknown.png?ex=65e6c31f&is=65d44e1f&hm=561f6a1a5229a974a9d385a436db54f1b29a6beb3b9f930058dc1de73038f8a4&)
will display an info popup, with `Info` as the title, and whatever helptext is in dp3 for the body
so now any dialog can have a simple, built-in help button
....should bind `F1` to opening it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 07:06

.......not so easy for old gui, so only gonna add that for new gui

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 07:27

.....well that wasn't so easy for the new gui either, damn
but I got it working
now every TopLevelWidget (for now, that's just `Window`), after adding its' specified key shortcuts, adds a special shortcut for F1 to call help text.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 08:09

Think I've got the GUI done for this
....still no way to fill bottles, no bottlefill shop, no code for using bottles, no code for bottle graphics, etc
so quite a bit to do still

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 08:58

```cpp
byte get_bottle_slot(dword slot)
{
    if(slot > 256) return 0;
    return bottleSlots[slot];
}
void set_bottle_slot(dword slot, byte val)
{
    if(slot > 256) return;
    if(val > 64) val = 0;
    bottleSlots[slot] = val;
}
bool fillBottle(byte val)
{
    for(size_t q = 0; q < 256; ++q)
    {
        if(bottleSlots[q] == 0)
        {
            set_bottle_slot(q, val);
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
bool canFillBottle()
{
    for(size_t q = 0; q < 256; ++q)
    {
        if(bottleSlots[q] == 0)
            return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```
whew, code for handling the slots
gotta add this to readsaves/writesaves so it gets stored in save file....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 09:02

should now be saving to save file
now time to give scripts access, so I can write some test scripts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 09:04

....I never gave scripts access to `lvlswitches`, either.....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 22:35

Okaaaaay

think I have the basis for bottle shops ready
oop that third one was set to green instead of blue whoops

if you don't have them named, it gives numbers
also I swear to god some stuff is annoying
```cpp
#ifdef IS_ZQUEST
extern miscQdata misc;
#define QMisc misc
#else
extern miscQdata QMisc;
#endif```
but this new `IS_ZQUEST` macro is a life saver
funny thing btw, `QMisc` exists in zquest.cpp
it's just *never initialized to anything and is always blank*
while `misc` contains the data
....but for zelda.cpp, `misc` doesn't exist, and `QMisc` holds everything.....
gonna have to clean that up sometime

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 22:38

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) idea: curiosity shop room type
if you use a bottle'd item in the room, it'll empty your bottle without getting used and give you rupees

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 22:39

interesting, though it would need a way to set how much for each bottled item
which means it needs *yet another* shop type gui and struct
so, gonna shoot that down for now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 22:40

with scripts it'd be easy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 22:40

(keyword for now, I'm just not doing that in the initial bottle implementation; we can always add it later)
of course it shouldn't just give rupees, it should give an arbitrary counter

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 22:40

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "(keyword for now, I'm just no…"): makes sense
and yeah
or an item

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 22:41

counter fill (% checkbox) + item
can set counter to none or item to none to use just one or the other
good ideas
gonna give that its own thread
#1186

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 22:45

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) idea:…"): what game is it from
as a script that also sounds extremely handy for "i need a potion"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:04

OK, I have most of the bottle room type set up
as in, everything in ZQ is set up
...need to actually *implement the room's behavior now*
which will be a fucking *joy*
Because of how shops work, I'm going to need to spawn dummy items, with their graphics set to look like the combos you set in the shoptype dialog, for the price things

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:05

hey yo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:05

and then cancel picking them up
but make you "hold up" the bottle that got filled

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:05

that might lead to OOT-style SOLD OUTs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:06

err, wouldn't really work that well

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:06

the code to change the shop type's item sprite would already be written
oh mm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:06

there wouldn't be a way to stop you from *buying the sold out sign*

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:07

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Because of how shops work, I'…"): wait *combos*? shouldn't it be a misc. sprite?
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "there wouldn't be a way to st…"): could have sworn there was already a can't buy something you already have rule that prevents you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:07

....they *are not items*
so that rule wouldn't help
a dummy item is being used for the collision
but its' item ID is meaningless

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:08

i'll explain more what i'm thinking in a FR later
it'd just be z1 shops, nothing to do with bottle shops

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:10

oh wait ammo expansions would throw a wrench in that
because you can never "already own" one
...unless you make every separate one-time-buy HCP its own item? i wonder if that already works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:11

🤢
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "it'd just be z1 shops, nothin…"): then it shouldn't be in this thread

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:13

yeah it was speculation anyways
again i'll need to do it later because fucking android discord

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:24

look at all that dummy item *bullshit*
I hope it works.....
it should spawn item 0, but with the dummy flag
and then override it's graphics with that of the combo
and override anything the constructor might have set from item 0's item editor settings, back to default

so, what's left:
-ZScript access to the `Bottle Types` editor
-ZScript access to the `Bottle Shop Types` editor
needs 2 new data types (probably `bottletype` and `bottleshopinfo`), and all the crap that requires to make work in the parser, PLUS all the arrays and functions it'll need for modifying the data

OH SHOOT EMILY

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/18/2021 19:59

yes

=== @ P-Tux7 11/18/2021 20:15

phew
i wonder if the lttp death animation and the fairy sprinkling magic could be done with a script
i dont care if its in engine as long as the script possibility can interact with the revival mechanic
...you know, when that happens, are OnDeath scripts run? or is he not "dead" yet?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/18/2021 20:25

There should be an onRevive script slot
I think I saw Emily implementing it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/18/2021 20:27

I haven't implemented it
but I have the prep ready to do it
it will run for exactly 100 frames, which are the 100 frames of a bottle being used

=== @ P-Tux7 11/18/2021 20:44

thank you!
wow i wonder what else this can be used for
incrementing the death counter and punishing you otherwise, sure, but what else!
hmm i wonder did lttp increment the death counter for fairy revivals
and if that should be a QR
interested in me requesting it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/18/2021 20:45

I'd love to know if LTTP did or not
if you can find that out

Using the `Bottle Fillers` itemclass, yes
But that uses an item slot; while a purely bottle shop uses 0 item slots

no problem
