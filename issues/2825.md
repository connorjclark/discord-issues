For example, if you have a tile warp on the screen, clicking the text on the bottom right about tile warps should open the tile warp dialog.

Maybe should be a right click menu, as this text is overlayed on the bottom row of the screen so we can't make that harder to place combos.

Also just saw someone new to the program try to modify the cave warps they put down by clicking on the combo on the screen. Seems natural. So: Add to right click menu of that combo to open Tile Warp? Or Shift + Click to open it (is shift taken?)

1. Oof, actually setting up a clickable box for the info text... I definitely don't want to touch that, but could be interesting
2. Cave warps ALREADY have that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 16:52

Oh nice. Wdyt of moving that to the top? Seems most specific options should be on top?
Or at least... On bottom
In middle seems worst choice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 16:53

I have no clue why this is set up this way and I'm guessing there's some big jank
frankly, we should probably rewrite the main screen rclick menus here from scratch

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 16:53

Probably index specifc crap disabling other options

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 16:53

yeah it's all index specific
so changing orders of stuff fucks with a bunch of shit
...and reminder that we have no "new gui" version of menus or anything
definitely *worth* redoing and reorganizing this stuff tho

=== @ mitchfork 11/06/2023 20:38

Would like to please ask that Select/Scroll remain on top for all combos. This is hard muscle memory and by far the most used right click options

=== @ Russ 11/06/2023 21:18

Hard agree with Mitch
If you move those, it’ll cripple me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 21:20

aye, agree as well
To be fair, I never use select though?
because like, alt+click just does that
but scroll is totally needed

=== @ Russ 11/06/2023 22:09

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "because like, alt+click just…"): … is there a master list of keyboard shortcuts somewhere? Cuz I’m still recovering from leaning K for combos earlier this year and now there’s this. I feel like I shouldn’t still be discovering new shortcuts like this after 17 years.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 22:09

in gmail press shift ?

I want that for ZC
GitHub has it too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 22:10

ok that's cool

for discord it's `Ctrl+?` btw
(replying to @ Russ "… is there a master list of k…"): anyway, for main combo placement
`Shift` = `Interact with cset only`
`Ctrl` = `Floodfill`
`Alt` = `Grab`
...combinations that make sense work, ex. `Shift+Ctrl` = `Floodfill cset only`, `Alt+Shift` = `Grab cset only`
there's a reason that `Alt`/`Shift`/`Ctrl` do what they do in the tile editor now
(hold `Alt` temp-swaps to the dropper tool, hold `Ctrl` temp-swaps to the fillbucket)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 22:13

it'd be nice if when holding these modifiers something on the screen said you were in a special mode
like the bottom right text but...I'd put this on some other corner

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 22:14

For the tile editor, it changes your cursor
...but no such equivalent for the main screen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 22:15

Ohhh let's do that. Bucket for flood fill
Eye dropper for cset
Idk something like that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 22:15

definitely togglable on an option
because I know I probably won't like the change myself
but, seems sane as a default setting
Doing new mouse stuff should be a metric fuckton easier than it used to be btw
we aren't using Allegro Legacy at all for mouse stuff
it's all pure direct A5

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 22:17

Do we have special customized cursors?
or just colors swap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 22:17

`namespace MouseSprite`
full customization should be trivial
it can take any A4 bitmap as a cursor
it stores it using the current palette when you call `assign`

This in `zq_misc.cpp` is handling all the current cursors
(loaded from `.dat` file)

and handles color swapping for the `Flag` cursor type for all 16 colors
There were bugs with allegro legacy's handling of this stuff, so I designed this whole system to replace the legacy code a while back
and it has access in the player, where scripts are able to set custom mouse sprites to display

basically, you just assign an index to a specific bitmap (with optional x/y focus point)- then you just `set` the mouse to that index to use that cursor.
`MAX_MOUSESPRITE` will obviously need to increase if you add more sprites
though the tile editor already has these

(top-right, `ZQM_POTION`, is the fillbucket; while below it `ZQM_LENS` is the dropper)
(replying to @ Russ "… is there a master list of k…"): btw, in the tile editor...
