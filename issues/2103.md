Test quest provided below:
Bomb Trigger combo flags (e.g. combo flag 6) on the edge of a screen will detect explosions that touch the edge of the opposite screen edge - if they're on layer 1 and 2 (layer 0 placed flags aren't bugged)

It seems like as far as default ZC items, only the super bombs can trigger this.  However, I've got some custom normal bombs with a much larger hitbox that can trigger this.

Seems like this is a fairly old bug.  It's happening way back at a110 for me.

=== @ mitchfork 12/21/2022 16:16

...in fact, way back at a106
that's the oldest version I currently have

Thoughts on just fixing or making a compat QR?

=== @ mitchfork 01/31/2023 13:13

Is the behavior old enough to need a compat rule?
If it was in 2.53, probably

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 14:03

(replying to @ mitchfork "If it was in 2.53, probably"): could you possibly test how old it is?

=== @ mitchfork 02/23/2023 16:23

Yeah, I can try out a couple of versions. Just have to get around to it

=== @ mitchfork 02/24/2023 03:41

So this occurs in 2.53.1, b55
So yeah, this is not a newly introduced 2.55 bug, it's been around a while.  Compat rule seems necessary I suppose

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2023 17:30

Should be fixed, compatruled.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 10:39

Can't test until after this week, but will try to remember
