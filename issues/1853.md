err, nope, not from the compression code
that's from the zasm array initialization optimization

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/10/2022 17:20

whatever

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 17:20

this is #1846, probably

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/10/2022 17:20

gotcha
ooh that stack trace just changed and made a "new bug" in sentry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2022 17:22

huh

I should really get you access to this tool
but it costs 30/mo to have unlimited members üëÄ

Just fixed #1854 , I think, lets see if that fixed this too...

Pretty sure this one is the one that got fixed, and the others are separate
