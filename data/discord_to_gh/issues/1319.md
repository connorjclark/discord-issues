Already has a lot expanded and used every Attribute already. I need to expand enemy attributes further to have more patra-related expansions.

whoop whoop

Data 2:
Type: True 2x2 (The BS Patra USES 2x2 graphics, but the hitbox is the center 32x16)
Data 3:
Stays Still: When Core is Firing, Expanding + Firing, Expanding + Warning + Firing
These would be really handy for bootleg 8-way "Newbie Bosses" that just be 2x2, fly around, and shoot. We already have that for the Walking Enemy type
Also, Misc Attrs 11/12 and 14 aren't used. I have one in mind if Misc. Attribute 14 can be used
Also... I understand this is probably gonna be a dickens, but what about a visual change for when the inner eyes/core are vulnerable?

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "These would be really handy f…"): Remember when "Silent World" tried to do that by using 2x2 Manhandlas and BS Patras?

I can already think it would make a pretty good Mothula boss.

Wait, why is "Shot Chance" an attribute? I thought that was Random Rate.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 21:35

Oh wait, Patras don't have a Halt Rate
