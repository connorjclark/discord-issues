Flags to make certain enemy classes take into account Sideview areas. This is low-priority, but would make for some good enemy variety and polish in sideview areas.
Note: When deciding where to spawn, enemies will never choose empty space that is their size + 16 above a combo. For instance, a 32x32 Walker would only spawn at 32px above a solid combo.
Enemies will also only choose combos whose top two Solidity or Effect squares are selected.
They will also decline to choose any combo with a No Enemies/No Walking Enemies flag.

Walker: How it already acts. Importing a quest sets this flag to on. The flag being off just makes it still act "4-way" even in sideview.
Lanmola: Ditto
Wizzrobe: Spawns atop a random solid combo. None of this "spawns above and falls on the player" nonsense lol. "Red" Wizzrobe facing makes it just face left and right, like Zelda 2. "Bat" Wizzrobe facing makes it able to appear above and below the player. "Phase/Blue" Wizzrobe facing gives it gravity and makes it unable to phase unless the area it would be phasing to would be a valid spawn location for it - no phasing into the floor.
Zora: Spawns on a random Liquid combo
Leever: Spawns on a random solid combo, obeys gravity (might turn at cliffs?)
Tektite: After hopping, continues to fall until reaching a solid combo.

if you're gonna add the mod-only tags yourself, try to add all of them (you missed `Open`, which is, *kinda* important)

(sorry, just wanted to get some things about the nature of this request VERY clear lol)

(Just mentioning because, normally I add the tags when I see a post with no tags- so by adding some but not all, I might have missed it. Not having the `Open` tag would mean if the thread archived itself, it would NOT show up when filtering by open reports, and would be buried/lost/forgotten)
