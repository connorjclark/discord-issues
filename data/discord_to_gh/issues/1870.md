This could be incorrect, as I'm not truly sure what the checkbox for "Invisible" should do if this is the behavior that I'm seeing, but it seems that if you have the "Invisible" checkbox **checked**, the subscreen item is __not__ invisible.  But unchecking it turns it invisible.

If this is intended behavior, perhaps a [?] block is in order to describe how and why it works?

----
Two side-by-side screenshots are included.  One with the flippers visible with the "Invisible" checkbox checked, and the other screenshot with the opposing situation.
I mean it's weird how literally all of my items on the subscreen have that "Invisible" box checked.
Just like in the pre-built Subscreens.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 13:45

check 2.50.2, is it the same? @ Changeling

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:12

Somehow, it seems to be confined entirely to Alpha 109.  I even made a new quest file with all of the default selections chosen and went immediately into the active subscreen and checked on the properties of some items, and they're Invisible.  Not so in earlier Alphas.  

Can anyone else confirm this?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:23

As in, I imported a quest I was working on from Alpha 108 into 109 (I overwrote the nightly from 9/16/22 into 109.)  and when I started working on it in 109, the Invisible box was checked for everything, but it wasn't checked for anything in 108.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 16:29

Err, wait, you went from the sept 16th nightly to A109? @ Changeling
...err, not that there was a sept 16th nightly, but it doesn't make a difference if you meant 15th or 17th here
but uh, A109 is from *August 17th*
So, you went *backwards* in version
that does not work, and will heavily corrupt a ton of shit in your quest

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:46

Nah, I went from a quest in 108 and brought it into last night's nightly.
I wouldn't in my right mind go backwards. üòõ
Maybe I'm just bad at explaining things.  I overwrote 109's files with the nightly because I don't know which Alpha this is yet until I download the nightly.
The nightlies aren't immediately obviously labeled with an alpha number, so I just overwrote the nightly build's zip file into whatever I had there.
But okay, whatever works.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 16:48

ok wait so
you were saved in A108
and then loaded in the latest nightly

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:48

And then copied 'n pasted it into the 109 folder -after- I had already overwritten everything using last night's build.

My apologies for the confusion.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 16:50

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "As in, I imported a quest I w‚Ä¶"): `(I overwrote the nightly from 9/16/22 into 109.)` that sentence is backwards
no problem though

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:51

It's 9/17/22.  Yesterday was 9/16/22. There was a release last night.  Alpha 109 has been out for a while.
I'm rethinking my entire life here.  D:

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 16:51

...oh
(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "It's 9/17/22.  Yesterday was‚Ä¶"): It says the nightly date in the link and the title of the nightly, last night's was actually this morning

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:52

I mean I'm buying you a drink for your hard work regardless at some point here.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 16:52

anyway uh, I think I just backwards the name
and that should say `Visible` instead or some shit
or, the flag needs to be inverted
for some reason

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:53

I suppose referring to them by the nightly date is more important than referring to them by the alpha name.

So, the "Invisible" checkbox that was in the past alphas has been altered or ...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 16:53

subscreen fucking sucks

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:53

Because it was always unchecked by default until this latest build.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 16:53

That entire dialog is new

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:53

Mm, fair.  Gotcha.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 16:53

I upgraded the dialog
to new system
and clearly missed a part where it reverses that flag

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:54

Ah.  Happy I could help somehow.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 16:54

If the behavior works normally, then it's just a dialog typo

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/17/2022 16:54

Yep, sounds like it.  üëç
I am relieved.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 16:56

should be fixed
