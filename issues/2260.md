Basically wondering if it would be possible to have an option for the combo pages to view **multiple columns of combos already offset**. Similar to if you bring up the combo menu with k and it shows you multiple columns of combos, which all are offset the same amount even when you go to another combo page. An example is also shown, where in the combo selection menu every column is offset by the height of the combo selector (30 combos in this case). The feature request being, an option to make that offset permanent. 

The reason for this feature would be to have better access to combos in the combo page, since having each of the columns able to independently go to different sections of the combo page is a bit clunky, especially when you switch between which column you are actively using. This would allow you to have significantly more combos organized into contiguous, large chunks in the combo page, which would be easily accessible from the combo menu.
