If a bomb's fuse timer expires whilst it's mid-air from being thrown, the bomb does not visibly explode and disappears shortly after landing.

Video demonstrating the bug in action, along with proof that the bomb is functioning in all other expected states: Placed, held, and grounded after being thrown.
