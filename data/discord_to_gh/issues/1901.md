`As of right now in ZC (pre-existing enemies included) there's a max total of 512 enemes that can be customized and edited and I would appreciate having that number bumped up to 999 at the very least.`

Same with SFX data, Items,  Palettes (Levels), etc.  Computer hardware today have advanced so much and are far more powerful, so I don't see why not.
