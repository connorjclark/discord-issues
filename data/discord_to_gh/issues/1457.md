I was trying to item bundle a bomb bag (with all the increase settings correct, correct counter setup in the subscreen, etc.) and the bomb item itself. However, it will not let me access it in the subscreen unless I also bundle at least 1 Bomb Ammo. This is the same with Super Bombs, but does not occur with Arrows and Quivers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/09/2022 23:22

Bombs don't appear on the subscreen when you have 0 bomb ammo
that has been a standard thing
for a long time
and is not a bug

=== @ vlamart 03/09/2022 23:24

It still appears on the subscreen, just can't select it

oh?
What?
That's.... odd
Is that rule on or off?

=== @ vlamart 03/09/2022 23:25

On, so it makes sense on paper at least
But also, I set the bomb bag to increase ammo with the max. Counter on the subscreen says I have more than 0 bombs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/09/2022 23:27

Oh????
wtf
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) haaaaaalp

=== @ vlamart 03/09/2022 23:32

I even set the bomb item itself to increase ammo by at least 1, and still not working unless also bundled specifically with at least 1 bomb ammo item (the test I'm doing sets ammo and max to 15, but no higher than 60, the last level bag quantity)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/09/2022 23:32

wtf
this is very weird
I'd love to look into it now, though I left some stuff in a crashy state last night that I need to finish up first

=== @ vlamart 03/09/2022 23:38

In that demo, the item bundle is "Adventure Bag" and the "bomb ammo (1)" is the 10th item

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 00:46

...it lets me select it just fine?
changing item 10 to `-1` (no item), it lets me select it

=== @ vlamart 03/10/2022 00:48

Huh...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 00:49

and just to poke around, I just removed the Bomb item and Bomb Bags from Init Data
starting without any of those, it still allows me to select it after grabbing the adventure bag
What version are you using?
(specific build date if nightly)

=== @ vlamart 03/10/2022 00:50

Latest nightly Feb 25 "immediate SCC fix"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 00:50

hmm
nothing should have changed since that
nothing anywhere near items has been touched at all
so, uhhh
<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>

=== @ vlamart 03/10/2022 00:52

I'll play around with it again, if I accidentally fixed it, go me I guess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 00:52

oh, though hmm
the super bomb is *visible* but not *selectable* as well
but you have no ammo for it
...seems like that might be intentional behavior for being out of ammo for them
but, if I have >0 bomb counter, I can select it on the subscreen
also tried removing the `1 bomb` that the `Bomb (Normal)` item adds to the counter
still works fine
even with the bomb bag being the only thing giving bombs
so, yeah. I'll close this thread (without locking); feel free to reopen it if you find an actual issue with this
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîíBomb Bag Shenanigans

=== @ vlamart 03/10/2022 04:01

So it worked for like a second, then I unchecked all the items from Init Data and tried again, and it still doesn't work, now neither does the arrow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 04:08

???

=== @ vlamart 03/10/2022 04:12

I even downloaded the quest file I posted up there, tested it there (on newest nightly posted tonight) and still not able to select them on the active subscreen. Here is the quest after some more fiddling

(Given I know the arrow doesn't shoot without the bow, I was still able to at least select the arrow before)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 04:17

I don't think you are meant to select an arrow without a bow?
adding a bow I am able to select both
I have a feeling your subscreen isn't set correctly
Notably, do you understand how subscreens handle items that you don't have?
It acts as if you kept going in the direction you pressed
so, with how you have it set up, if you have only boomerang and bombs
you have no way to change your selection
as going straight up, down, left, and right will never lead to bombs from boomerang
Going left from the far-left column should go to the end of the *previous* row
and going right from the far-right column should go to the start of the *next* row
never the *same* row
Also, quickswap with L/R act as pressing left/right, so the way you have it set up, you can only quickswap within the same row

=== @ vlamart 03/10/2022 04:21

This was all very helpful, because what you described was wrong is exactly what I did üòù
