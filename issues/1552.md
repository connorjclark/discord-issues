So two things, for starters, I believe this rule is incorrectly categorized. It's listed as a bug fix when it should be a combo rule. This has way more gameplay repercussions than a simple bugfix should. Secondly, on attempting to check how it handles cycling pits, it dumped me at dmap 0, screen 0. Could be a quirk of test play mode, but I made certain to take multiple warps and step over several valid respawn points first.

that is extremely odd
test quest to replicate @ Moosh ?

=== @ Moosh 04/18/2022 18:07

I sure do not. God this thing is being a pain to figure out :/

=== @ Moosh 04/18/2022 18:09

Oh ffs, I see what happened

=== @ Moosh 04/18/2022 18:11

There's a script in my quest that predates the rule that does pretty much the same thing, recording a safe spawn point and warping Link there. And having the new behavior enabled broke it apparently

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/18/2022 18:11

ah, so script error
any idea what specifically broke?

=== @ Moosh 04/18/2022 18:11

Still think you should move it to a different rule category though. This is _not_ a bugfix in my books

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/18/2022 18:12

ahk

recatigorization, thankfully, takes exactly one copy+paste, within one file

=== @ Moosh 04/18/2022 18:17

Okay script bug seems to be a test play thing. I was not expecting me to spawn in on the screen I did and so the respawn point wasn't getting set. This script is kinda jank and in need of a rewrite tbh
Apologies for the false alarm on this one
