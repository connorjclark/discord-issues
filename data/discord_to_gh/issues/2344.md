Switching from tab 1 to tab 2, then back to tab 1 seems to bring up different colors for tab 1. Not sure if this is still a thing or not but I noticed it in alpha 112. There's a short video included.

also idk why it's tagged as a "crash" I couldn't remove that from the post

heard from someone else that this doesn't seem to happen in alpha 113, fwiw. so it's probably been fixed

this was fixed a couple months back IIRC
