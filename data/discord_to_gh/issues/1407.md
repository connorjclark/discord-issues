For the LTTP tileset. A tile that you can set to be the item's representation on the active and passive subscreen instead of the tile of the sprite that you pick up/get from a chest.
Nothing fancy - just hijack the subscreen item draws with a non-animated tile. Doesn't even touch the subscreen editor.

(Okay, that code might need some updates to preview the item subscreen tiles... but that's all rendering. No new/modified subscreen elements or anything)
