In particular, ffcscript.zh 2.0.1 had two versions of CountFFCsRunning, one that took "char32 ptr" as an argument, another that took "int scriptnum" as an argument. 2.0.2 only has the latter function. Scripts will still compile fine, but any call of CountFFCsRunning that uses a string will simply fail to function. This appears to be the case for most functions in the header.
This feels particularly bad as it doesn't throw any error messages, so users would be none the wiser. Scripts that used the old functions that took a string as an argument simply stop functioning

Which scripts used that version?
It really isn't efficient to be using a string literal every time anyway
but, they were removed due to a separate issue
Also, the version with strings was NEVER posted anywhere, it was only included in the ZC package, hidden in a damn folder. I literally didn't know it existed until it caused compile errors with something else for Moosh.
There is a new function at the top, which takes the string, and returns the script ID. Using that is far preferred, as it also has an included error message indicating that the script was not assigned to a slot, which is much MORE user friendly for people setting up database scripts.
So, intentional update, of a header that was never posted in the DB, because Zoria wrote his update to it poorly.
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîíffcscript.zh now bundled in std is broken

```cpp
if(int scr = CheckFFCScript("ScriptName"))
{
    ffc f = RunFFCScript(scr);
}```
