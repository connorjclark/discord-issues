This was reported by JulianVerse in the PureZC server. We did some testing and I think have narrowed the issue to screen flags. Both Zoras and ladder screens in the quest Return to Hyrule aren't working at all. Resaving the quest in 2.53 fixed the issue. So my hypothesis is the editor is able to see what the flags should be set to, but the player is reading them incorrectly.
Here's the quest file demonstrating the issue. Just right of the start there should be a zora.

This may be the same bug as https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/943287134423511050
Just with broader effects than we thought
