Add a QR to autofill InitD[] labels from ZASM metadata for the selected script

(If enabled, InitD labels will stop being editable, and will auto-populate from whatever script is assigned)
(Item scripts, and Active/Passive Subscreen Scripts, will pull from the `Action`/`Active` script metadata)

Fantastic! This will save some headache for quest designers so you don`t have to check script setup instructions to remember which D input which setting defines, especially for complex scripts.
