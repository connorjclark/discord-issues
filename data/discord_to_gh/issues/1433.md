Most sprites, including enemies, have an innate -2 Y offset, which throws things off when scripting. Can we have a way to remove that?

=== @ Moosh 02/26/2022 05:40

I think there's already a rule for this. It's just named something goofy like BS Animation or something

=== @ Orithan 02/26/2022 06:25

Huh?
I did not know this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/26/2022 07:14

Yeah, BS Animation Quirks
first rule in the animations tab

=== @ Orithan 02/26/2022 12:22

I take it this is not in 2.53

=== @ Moosh 02/26/2022 12:37

It had a different name in 2.53. BS-Zelda Animation

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/26/2022 12:49

Still first rule of the animations tab

=== @ Orithan 02/26/2022 22:17

(replying to @ Moosh "It had a different name in 2.…"): That doesn't remove it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/26/2022 22:29

no, having it checked causes it
unchecking it removes it but causes other jank to happen

=== @ Orithan 02/26/2022 22:51

Unchecked it. It still persisted

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/26/2022 22:54

Okay, is this offset applying to Link, and are you in a dungeon?

=== @ Orithan 02/27/2022 00:36

No and in Interior

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/27/2022 11:40

weird.
