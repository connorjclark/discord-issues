Is this possible? It would improve the preview mode substantially.

this discussion was literally had like yesterday somewhere lol
but, uh, very much *no*
triggers stuff is not touching ZQ at all that's a huge rewrite and fuck that nope.

In case someone else is encouraged to do this: please wait post-z3 as this merge conflict would make me lose my mind

Yeah a big difficulty doing preview mode in the first place was that ZQ doesn't actually *do* any of the logic ZC itself does
I can't remember if I explicitly exposed the engine logic to ZQ or just recreated it in ZQ itself
but either way, doing that for more involved features is likely the reason Preview mode was never really expanded upon

Does that mean that if ZQuest was open and Preview Mode was on, and I suddenly renamed the ZC Player to something else, Preview mode wouldn't work properly?  Or is that not it at all and I'm just daydreaming.

no no, nothing like that
