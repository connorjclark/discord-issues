A way to when you call a music track by script for playback, it will take priority. Meaning that it won't go back to the regular DMap track as soon as you switch screen.

Differenty priority levels on the calls would be nice:
Retain while on the same DMap or canceled by script.
Retain Globally no matter the DMap till canceled by script.
-
where did the message go?
ugh
anyway, guess I'll re type it

Priority playback as an option when calling music playback via scripts. So that a track can be maintained and don't switch back to the DMap track as soon as you screen transition.

More than one priorty level would be nice too if you could set it when doing the call:
Retaining while on the same DMap till either you switch DMap or a scripts calls for the priority to be canceled (or new track to be played)

Retaining globally till a script calls for cancel or a script calls a new track.

This would be nice. The current only way to do this is to update the dmapdata music track as well, which you then have to manually "clean up" later - often in a different script scope than you started with
