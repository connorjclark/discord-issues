I don't know if this is possible or difficult for devs to turn most combo attribute type in fields into drop down menus.  It would make it alot easier for questmakers to set attributes to the values they want.  SFX data, Sprite Decoration, etc. Dropset for example where you can see the name of the value right away rather than having to close the combo editor dialog and go into the SFX or sprite data to find the number what slot you want and go back into the combo editor dialog remembering what slot number to type in the attribute field.  in a nutshell, it's like the palette dropdown in the Dmap editor where you can see the palette names in the dropdown menu.
