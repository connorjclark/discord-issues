I have strings in my quest for a variety of things and purposes and the current system leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to simply keeping track of what string goes into what category. What I want is a sort of virtual folder or custom category system where you can move a bunch of strings into a custom virtual folder you can name and have the strings there. Although I could see implementation being something of a bugbear.

Tagging / filtering based on a single tag sufficient?
If we want to be very minimalistic...we'd just have tagging with a fixed set of colors üòõ
only reason for that is just doing any UI work is a PITA (for me, at least).

At this point anything would be better
but I still earnesty want a category/virtual folder system

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) I think I got a solution for achieving better string organization: String Banks.

For the purpose of older quests all strings would be assigned to string bank 0, and new strings can be assigned to new string banks to achieve better string organization
