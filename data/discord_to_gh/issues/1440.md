Right in the title. Similar to the hurt SFX script in the database, but also for other player actions. I can see many others using this feature if it's made!

wait, is the spin attack sound not in the item itself?
that would be more logical
a la the swords
i might as well request item flags for them then, they don't have much else to use them for

=== @ P-Tux7 03/02/2022 00:18

also hrm i think drowning sound should be a liquid attribute (i.e. water vs. lava). i'll check to see if we have any to spare

=== @ Jared 03/02/2022 00:22

I agree!!

=== @ Jared 03/06/2022 22:28

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) have you seen this yet?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/08/2022 00:54

ability to customize player sounds?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 00:55

it would be a single sound for each action
so @ Jared if you were thinking of the like, varied hurt sounds thing, then no
...but adding a single sound for the actions would allow scripts to do that type of thing
My question is, what does the SFX field on the spin scroll do, if anything?

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 00:56

You know, I haven't actually tried

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 00:56

because, that's where I'd expect to set a sound for the spin attack
with a potential separate one for a hurricane spin

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 00:57

It has a spin sound sfx

=== @ P-Tux7 03/08/2022 00:57

oughta do it then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 00:57

that should be all you need then

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 00:57

Too bad the spin sfx's are broken on the noproblo website

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 00:58

pits have a fall sfx
...though, I don't see a drown sfx on water @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 00:58

Is that for enemies AND Link tho?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 00:59

yes, though we intended to add a separate one for enemies
I think

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 00:59

I wanted ones for Link and a separate one for enemies in general
We don't need Link shouting every time an enemy falls in a hole lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 00:59

hmm, but that one is also items
so
yeah
having one for each enemy customizable
and one for link
would be smart
and if the link/enemy one is set to 0, use the one on the combo instead

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/08/2022 01:00

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...though, I don't see a drow…"): Should be combo attributes for liquid?
I *know* it's a thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 01:00

it has an sfx for the hp mod
from like, healing/damaging liquid

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 01:00

Only attribute is drown damage

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 01:00

but not one for drowning
(replying to @ Jared "Only attribute is drown damage"): flags change attributes
based on what flags are checked

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 01:01

???

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 01:01

Ohhhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 01:01

the only attribute is most certainly not drown damage
but, that sfx there is for the `Modify HP (Passive)` effect
not for drowning

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 01:02

was looking at this lol
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948361857062805525/950559081528168569/unknown.png?ex=65e66f21&is=65d3fa21&hm=04a268c3f9546f75278e464d37555526890f13bbdd51f37963019012b6d539fa&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 01:02

yeah, gotta look at all the flags and stuff to actually see everything
some attributes will have different names depending on what flags are set, because they do different things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 01:04

...though I can't actually find a good example of one that doesn't just swap between named and blank
might not actually have any right now?
but, in theory, we can

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/08/2022 01:04

uhhh
Does Link even have a drowning sfx?

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 01:04

Nope

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 01:05

...oh
fun
so, default value is 0
makes it much easier, frankly
no need to attach a flag to it
can just be an attribyte directly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 01:06

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) you should be able to add any global sounds for link here

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948361857062805525/950560137913958420/unknown.png?ex=65e6701d&is=65d3fb1d&hm=49a02d72b33f68a393c6b4eac867ed39b2506e1a1ee07875d8ad63af67d4ae23&)
which, should be extremely easy to expand
the gui side works just like adding QRs
auto-formatted, auto-new-tabs, etc

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 01:09

Oh cool!

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 01:13

That's one thing out of the way. Now I just need a script/scripts for three random sfx of spin attack and hurt sounds

=== @ P-Tux7 03/08/2022 01:48

yeah um
#1350
check pins for all we need
also, "error"?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 01:50

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "also, "error"?"): Try the ? Buttons

=== @ P-Tux7 03/08/2022 01:50

oh right
btw grass slash and pound pounded definitely sound like they need to be transferred to said combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 01:51

Why don't you look at said combos before saying that

=== @ P-Tux7 03/08/2022 01:54

because i have a migraine and am going to bed at 8 PM and i don't want to get light blasted by my laptop screen right now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 01:54

Fair
(It already is, at least on bushes; idr if pound does)
