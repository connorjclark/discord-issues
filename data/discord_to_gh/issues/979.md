This is the nittiest of nitpicks out there so keep in mind that I realize this. When you click the item square button in ZQuest it auto opens a prompt to select an item. Currently if you select (None) it treats this the same as having hit cancel. And in most cases this makes sense, if you're placing an item you probably want to place an actual item. But there is one exception to this: item cellar screen 80. In that one case, the item spawn position is used for an item set on another screen and no item will normally appear there. Whenever I set up a new screen 80, I'll just place a random item and then go back and set the screen item to (None), but since the cancel button is already a thing it'd be nice to cut out that extra step. Thoughts?

I also realize that there's no harm in leaving an item on screen 80. It'll get properly replaced. But it looks better in the editor without. Also the contents of screen 80 can still show up in quest reports, which may or may not be a bug itself

i'd call items an issue for quest reports, but the screen (or staircase and cave screens) can't be excluded entirely due to it having valid user-placed combos and enemies

this makes sense, though I could see it being annoying for some; can probably make it a ZQ config

Sounds good. Either that or a screen 80 specific exception
