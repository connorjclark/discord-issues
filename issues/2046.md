Setting an FFC's Data to a combo with type "Screen Freeze (Except FFCs)" no longer appears to work.
For reference, these are the tango freeze/unfreeze functions I'm using:
```void __Tango_FreezeScreen()
{
    ffc freeze = Screen->LoadFFC(32);
    freeze->Data = 53;
    SuspendGhostZHScripts();
    startCutscene();
}

void __Tango_UnfreezeScreen()
{
    ffc freeze = Screen->LoadFFC(32);
    freeze->Data = 0;
    ResumeGhostZHScripts();
    clearCutscene();
}```

And that's the combo 53 setup.  My strings are not freezing action properly in this version

I think this might be fixed already, but, mixed with the slope code. Should be merged shortly.
