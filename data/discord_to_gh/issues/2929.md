I think it'd be cool if we had options to center, left or right the text in text boxes. Would make it easier for things such as cutscenes or signs.

I don't even begin to know how this would work...

Surprising considering scripted string can already do a selected format,? What makes it diff for engine strings?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 04:31

well a scripted string is drawn all at once
engine strings... are drawn character by character

wouldn't this make more sense as a flag/attribute per-string?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 05:58

even then it wouldn't be easy

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "wouldn't this make more sense…"): I actually misread this request last night as being this

Darn. It’s just hard with using spaces because sometimes it’s not perfectly centered depending on the letter and font.
