Really , Really needed for making menus!!

?

@ DergerSwerson the title does not give anywhere near enough detail for me to understand what you want

=== @ DergerSwerson 02/26/2022 10:19

I apologize. The request is so that, when you mouse over the string menu, it displays the x and y of that mouse position, in order to make setting up menus with SCCs easier
i mean
the string preview
not the menu

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 10:19

... how would that help with menus?

=== @ DergerSwerson 02/26/2022 10:21

I guess it should say the 'position' then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 10:21

?

=== @ DergerSwerson 02/26/2022 10:21

whatever position your mouse is hovering over should be displayed below the preview somewhere

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 10:22

.... 'position' has NOTHING to do with x/y

=== @ DergerSwerson 02/26/2022 10:22

yeah, i misread the string control code text file earlier
i thought it wanted an x and y position, my bad

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 10:22

It works the same way position works on the engine subscreen

=== @ DergerSwerson 02/26/2022 10:23

like say you wanted to know what that boxes position was... youd have to count up each time, yes?

oh
i see now
apologies
it works as though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 10:24

You'd use 0 for the first choice
Then 1 for the second choice
Or 1 first 2 second, it doesn't actually matter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 10:26

(Realistically, you could use 42 first and 69 second, it's entirely arbitrary)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 10:27

So, if you wanted up/down to swap between the 2 choices, and left/ right to do nothing
You'd use `\129\0\1\1\0\0` and `\129\1\0\0\1\1`
Placed where,  *in the string*, you want them to appear
Be sure to do the `\128` code with whatever args you want *before* the `\129`s
And, it should show the menu cursor in the preview window

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 10:30

Let me know if you need any help

here's a simple example
the menu cursor here is tile `52000` in cset `0`
if you select `yes`, it goes to string `3`, selecting `no` goes to string `4`
so
`\128\52000\0\6\6\0` = `Set the menu cursor to tile 52000, cset 0, 6x6 pixels, not flipped`
`\25` = `line break`
`\129\0\1\1\0\0` = `This is cursor position 0. Pressing Up or Down goes to position 1. Pressing Left or Right goes to... position 0, which is this position, so they do nothing.`
`\129\1\0\0\1\1` = ...same as above, but flip the 0s and 1s
`\130` = `make the player choose`
`\131\0\3` = `if position 0 was chose, goto string 3`
`\131\1\4` = `if position 1 was chose, goto string 4`

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîíMouse Over X and Y in String Preview

This on the engine subscreen for item selection
is basically what the `\129` code does
except, if any of the directions is equal to `position`, it does *nothing*
