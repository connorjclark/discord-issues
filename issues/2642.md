Oddly specific issue I encountered trying to help Nightmare with something in his quest. I can only reproduce the issue in his subscreen.

Okay correction, it's the Cambria tileset specifically

...And it's tied to having any counter on the subscreen

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> TWO spots
(So, if you had a Counter or Button Counter on your subscreen, this would happen)
(fixed)
