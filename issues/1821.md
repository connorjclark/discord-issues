If an item was spawned from the CreateItemAt(); script and the ruleset 'Hold Up Items' is checked through the screen data, Link still doesn't hold up the item.

=== @ Tabletpillow 08/20/2022 02:03

The item is picked up but there is no animation
Even with the ruleset checked

That'd be correct
you need to set the spawned item to hold on pickup
the screen flag is only for items placed on the screen normally via zquest
```cpp
itemsprite spr = CreateItemAt(id, x, y);
spr->Pickup |= IP_HOLDUP;```
(meta) thread name was changed: ❌No hold up animation on items spawned through scripts through screen data

Can't this also be forcefully enabled in the Item Editor now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 02:24

yep, that too, you can set it for each item ID there

I see, but it wasn't always like this right?
Since the GB chest script for example I noticed that some quests that used it in the past could be affected by that.
But the script itself could be edited to allow pickups at least.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 02:26

err, I wouldn't think it would ever have been different
nothing's been changed with this that I'm aware

all items SHOULD retain their default pickup properties when played in 2.55
