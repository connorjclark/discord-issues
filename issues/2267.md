I would like to ask for a custom ZC player.exe next to the normal ZC player in future Alpha versions or after them. It would simply be labeled ZC player (Stretch) so it would not overwrite the normal one. Some people have longer computer screens and need that like me, so they can take full advantage of the screen is why. 
Basically every time combo data is changed in an Alpha to include one. 
Also I absolutely love this setting you made Emily and I wanna keep a copy. Please make this feature come back but on the side \0-0/
