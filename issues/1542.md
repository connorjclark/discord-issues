``npc->Knockback()`` can knock NPCs into the edges of solid combos

@ Orithan @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) it appears to be tied to the offgrid enemy flag for some reason

if it isn't checked, then the canwalk function it uses skips the 15 pixels that aren't the leftmost or topmost side that's being checked
if offgrid is enabled... it only skips 7 pixels instead of 15
yeah I think I'm just gonna replace the canwalk function it's checking with the ghosted one.
