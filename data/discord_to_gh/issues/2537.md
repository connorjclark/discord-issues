`HeroClass::finishedmsg` clears A and B button states. This was happening in @ Majora 's global script (calling `Message(0)` every frame, it seemed), which resulted in his combo button trigger (configured for A) never firing, because the button state was being eaten by that point.

Not sure what could be done here. If this "canceling" is necessary, can we somehow do it just one time until the next non-zero value is seen?

🤢 Cancelling should NOT be necessary *when called from a script*, I wouldn't think
but it is when called from engine
`Screen->Message(0)` needs to specifically avoid this

kinda lost, what is "this" it should avoid?

(cancelling the buttons)
that's a completely unexpected behavior
(needs compat rule, of course, for old quests)

=== @ Majora 07/19/2023 07:45

wait uhhhhh
it was a script I hadn't set up (and tbh it's very old so i'm gonna axe it)

I mean, still, a bad/unexpected behavior

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "`HeroClass::finishedmsg` clea…"): the point, as far as I gather, is that you normally press A or B to close a string- so it's trying to eat *that press*. Obviously `Screen->Message(0)`... is not a button press closing a string.
