The game sometimes fails to register release of direction control input. Which causes Link/Hero to move uncontrollably in one direction until pressing then releasing that direction manually. Happens uncommonly and cannot reproduce specifically. But when it happens, it`s very annoying. The most glaring occurence of that bug was in replay of 100 Rooms of Wisdom 2 at room 85, where Link started moving downwards with all inputs on keyboard being off. 
Issue like this never happened in other games.

@ Alucard648 Are you using the 4 way movement like Z1?

=== @ Alucard648 02/14/2024 23:28

8-way movement used.

Okay, I guess that means it isn't just for 4-way.
