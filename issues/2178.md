=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 17:14

Technically this feature was available in 2.53 and early 2.55, but was removed at some point. Although you don't use CSets 12 - 14 in normal situations (and I believe 14 changes to reflect the current Boss Palette loaded), these are stored and can be used with scripts setting ->CSet to 12, 13, or 14. I even have some older pre-2.55 quests that took advantage of this feature.

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 17:20

What's the function of accessing these csets when they display the wrong colors in ZQuest? I'd say previewing tiles in sprite csets, but that already exists with load to cset 9 I believe?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 17:21

You don't use them in zQuest at all. It's the scripted part that is their unique use.
A couple quests of mine have a unique "super enemy" CSet 12 that gets used with an "enemy rando"

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 17:23

As in you placed combos in cset 12 to be read by a script?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 17:23

Yes.

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 17:24

oof

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 17:25

Definitely of the mind that if this returns it should be restricted by an editor setting and that setting should be hidden away enough (in config files) that only those who understand the extra csets can use it

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 17:26

Because "three extra csets" sounds real enticing to new users who don't understand how the program uses them and will cause major confusion for them
Like when I tried using the system colors in 8-bit tiles in LQftH1

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 17:29

As seen in 2.52. Only used CSet 12, didn't really look into 13 and 14 until later.

As mentioned, 14 is special since it's the loaded boss palette.
But 12 and 13 work fine when used with ->CSet
(14 works, you just have to keep track of the palette last loaded)

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 17:31

ZQuest can load boss palettes? Or you just mean in ZC

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 17:31

In ZC

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 17:31

gotcha

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2023 17:31

That's the trick, you can't use these CSets in zQuest, but can in ZC
(mostly cause regardless of what you set them to, 12 - 14 are used for engine stuff in zQuest)
I have no issues with it being a toggleable option, to avoid confusion.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2023 18:26

Speaking of boss palettes - are those spoken for in ZQuest and are only "freed up" in ZCP?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 22:28

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Speaking of boss palettes - a…"): The minimap in the bottom left of ZQ takes up 2 full csets

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 14:08

so.... what exactly is the request here? You've asked for them in the `Main Palette Window`, but, what's the point of that? They never had any use in the main palette window, as edits to them would not be saved, I'm pretty sure?
Regardless, this really gets into some buggy/janky bullshit, which makes me really *not* want to touch this.....

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 16:22

The request is, these used to be available, I have a use for them, and would like them accessible again.
(I think Dimi said she was the one who made them hidden / "removed", but she hasn't been doing dev stuff in a while so I can't ask her)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 16:33

Just tested in 112, these CSets are still saved and usable. At minimum, this is a form of compatibility, since I have quests that use these CSets since earlier versions.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/23/2023 18:09

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "(I think Dimi said she was th…"): for what it's worth, i recall emily approving that change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:10

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Just tested in 112, these CSe…"): in what way did this even work that was not unusably buggy
need to know exactly what you need back

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:12

`targetNpc->CSet = 12;`
This uses the CSet 12 - 14 of the Main palettes.
It's used in Mirage Island for the enemy "rando" when an enemy rolls a bunch of +Stats and is meant to represent the enemy being above average in power.
In DDD, it's the palette assigned to all enemies in "Nightmare" difficulty.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:14

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "As seen in 2.52. Only used CS…"): so, you need the *palette editor* for this?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:14

To be able to change those CSets.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:14

...those actually save???

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:14

They do.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:14

I *know I have tried to use those before and had them not work*

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:15

I loaded DDD in 112, and sure enough the enemies are using the CSet 12 just fine.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:15

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> I fucking hate this program

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:15

I know CSet 14 updates to the most recently used Boss Palette
And obviously, all three of these CSets are unusable in zQuest. This is a ZC-exclusive trick.
But it gives me 2 special-use CSets. I have not tested if anything else also works with ->CSet = 12 / 13
(how did you try to use them, maybe it's npc only... which then begs the question, why do they work?)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:17

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "(how did you try to use them,…"): they work because someone failed to prevent their use
they shouldn't be usable, because they aren't usable in ZQ

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:17

Wait, so it's prevented elsewhere?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:18

in some places

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:18

So I basically stumbled into a loophole.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:18

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> What I'm honestly wondering
at this point
is if we can free those up in ZQ, and just add 2 more whole csets
which is a lot more work, and will require A5 bullshit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:20

(I'll need to free 13 and 14 in ZQ which are used for the minimap)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:20

For awhile, Zoria had made it where you could scroll through CSets 12 - 15 in the tile editor. And it was bad, since those CSets were in the unusable state there.... or maybe looking at different data than wherever the Main Palette CSets were stored?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:20

(then, move everything in ZQ using 12 to use 14 instead)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:22

So for whatever reason, the Main Palette window was the only place zQuest could properly display those CSets?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:23

If you'll note, when you open the main palette window, the background blacks out

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:23

While that window was up, CSets 12 - 14 were not being overwritten by zQuest stuff?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:23

because that window has different palette info

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:24

So out of curiosity, anywhere else you know CSets 12 - 14 be called via script? (places without the prevention)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:24

🤷‍♀️
and there's no guarantee those will have stayed the same compat wise either
they were not *ever* intended to be used
....I do feel like I may be able to free up 12 and 13 though, as actual real usable csets
though it'll be a lot of work

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:25

Makes sense, 14 is still the dedicated Boss Pal CSet

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:26

In ZQ I'll be freeing 13 and 14, but then moving everything from 12 to 14

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:26

Even though I can call ->CSet = 14, it will produce differing results based on the last boss loaded.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:26

I think anyway, pretty sure 13 and 14 are the minimap colors

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:29

Yeah, that looks about right. Also, those are the CSets used in 8 Bit and combos with a CSet2 offset that displays them.
Wait....
If I made a combo with the CSet2 Offset, placed it so it would display CSet 12... it would probably look different in ZC over zQuest cause of this palette stuff.
Did.... did no one actually use *this* trick in a quest?
Did no one figure out that the CSets in the main palette get used in ZC even if they appear unused in zQuest?
Is it jank? Absolutely? Are there quests that use jank for crazy "advanced" trickery? Yes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:31

Does that still even work

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:32

I mean, since you cannot edit those CSets in versions since.... some Nightly I don't have on this comp but the prior.... it's a bit harder to test, but...
Since I do have two Tilesets that did set CSet 12 for usage, I can check quick in one of them.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:35

It does.

That is the grayish-green of CSet 12

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:35

....huh

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:35

See, I am really curious if *no one* did this in a quest at some point.
Yes, the screen will look dumb in zQuest, but functional in ZC
So, here is the short term question.
How hard would it be to have a ZQ setting to toggle access to CSets 12 - 14 in the main palette?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:37

harder than I'd like

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:37

So they are hidden from the casual user, but those who know the trick can still use it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:37

especially when it's jank bullshit
and again
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....I do feel like I may be a…"): ^
give me a minute

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:37

(I meant short term as I don't expect the CSet 12-13 freeing up for a good while)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:39

I guess it's not critical, I don't have any plans right now to suddenly use CSet 12 or 13 beyond what is already there, and the CSets were functional when I made them and have been saved even when access was lost.
I'm more putting it on the radar that there was a use for them, and there could be some quests out there that figured out the trick and maybe desire access to edit those CSets in the future.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:47

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "(I meant short term as I don'…"): you underestimate me
(she says cockily, definitely not about to regret such boasting)
oh, also, I'm wrong, it is already 12/13 used for minimaps

=== @ P-Tux7 02/23/2023 18:48

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Even though I can call ->CSet…"): I think every boss except Ganon can be made to not load a BPal anyways

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 18:48

which actually makes it easier

=== @ P-Tux7 02/23/2023 18:49

...jank idea, load a dummy enemy on the first screen of the quest that loads a BPal, and then you have that BPal for the rest of the session

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:49

I forget what the default CSet 14 is.
I don't think it's actually the 14 of the Main Palette Window.
(did I test this at some point, can I find that test quest?)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 18:55

I *know* I had this discussion with Dimi at some point, I may have even done a test quest for it... but I don't know how long ago, and it's possible that specific test quest was not transferred off my old comp last May

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 19:41

sooooooooooooo

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1074740347164446761/1078401237126484068/image.png?ex=65ea186a&is=65d7a36a&hm=fdcab8147770b70466ac3974b9e4ade1aa04b0de2b8d57fdbf12212c7ed90746&)
....do note that that's more minimap colors than previously was *possible*

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 19:42

Was CSets 12 and 13 just the DMap Minimap stuff?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/23/2023 19:43

I thought.... some of the colors had other uses? (at minimum, I recall some of the Minimap colors changing after going into the tile editor)
Still, would be convenient if that was most of it's hardcoded usage in one place.

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 19:44

Were they not used for cheat colors too? Or was that all in 15?

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 19:45

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): Also are these colors all pulled from level palettes? Because pog if true
yeah these do look like Classic's palettes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 19:47

(replying to @ Moosh "Also are these colors all pul…"): So, basically, how it worked, is it pulled from the first 16 level palettes
2 colors from each
which fills 2 full csets
and it mod 16'd the palette number to figure out which of those to use
....this is truecolor A5 shit, so, I'm just grabbing it from the level palette *directly*.

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 19:49

And this is all done in a later pass after the whole editor UI is drawn?

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 19:51

In which case how's it work with cursors and tooltips? Both can potentially draw over the map right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 19:53

yeah, uh, so those are the current problems
The cursor itself is already a5 shit so that's fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 19:55

but uh
if you were to say
open a *dialog popup*
....that also appears *under the minimap* right now
so, probably going to have the minimap just go invisible while dialogs are open

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 19:57

A little janky but understandable
Alternative would be what? Draw all dialogs to a new bitmap and then blit that after the map pass?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 19:57

....the alternative would be making dialogs do a5 shit, but that's fancy shit
here's the thing, we're set up for fancy
connor set us up a whole render tree system
that isn't being used like at all in zq
(it's being used in ZC, responsible for the transparent blue pause and such)
ideally I'd make dialog popups be their own layer above everything else
but, this is dealing with some pretty serious jank

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 19:59

Right, you said that's using a shader right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 19:59

err, no

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 19:59

oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 19:59

I was *attempting* to get it to use a shader
never got that working

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 19:59

darn but understandable

So, there are now 3 a5 layers
the main window
the minimap
and the tooltips
Currently, both extra layers blank out when a dialog is open
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1074740347164446761/1078415278813225001/image.png?ex=65ea257e&is=65d7b07e&hm=9471a6959eddab5c0d52a2bf63c299c60954292b3291aa333b182877daa80527&)
as otherwise they would draw *over* the dialogs.
Next step is trying to add a dialog layer, though that's more complicated.
oh, should add @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) to this thread
your render tree stuff is getting some fancy use

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 20:42

pushed what I have so far as a branch

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/23/2023 20:59

Glad you've been able to make use of it. Did you want me to look at the branch?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 21:03

I have just hit a hard brick wall with dialogs
....I feel like I'm going to need to split the `gui.cpp` functions (`do_zqdialog`, etc) into separate zc/zq versions
hmmm
or I need to majorly rework it where it is
not sure what's best

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 21:22

oh I pray that what I've just attempted just works
and doesn't have any memory fucky crashy bullshit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 21:25

....that did.... like, literally nothing?
no crashy, but also it doesn't work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 21:26

oh, wait
no, it only works on new gui dialogs where I put it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 21:38

PAHAHAHAA

hmm

so the minimap draws fine... until I tab out and back in?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 21:40

...that seems odd to me
might need your help with that bit once I push this
but first to make it work for the normal dialogs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 21:47

there we go with normal dialogs
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1074740347164446761/1078432819442888754/image.png?ex=65ea35d4&is=65d7c0d4&hm=be711606f838f6df9913c7fd4a7ad463ca4de45412d0be7dd021b1886f4c6c74&)
though, now zc is broken, need to mirror what I did in zq

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 21:54

basically, every dialog that opens, creates a brand new A4 bitmap the size of the screen
which temporarily replaces the `screen` global variable
and steals the mouse
the topmost dialog always has the global and the mouse, and those get passed down as each dialog closes, until it reverts to the original screen
in the render tree, `rti_dialogs` exists, and it's `a4_bitmap` gets the combined result of all of the individual dialog A4 bitmaps, layered
...mm, it isn't working for zc though....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 22:05

ah, there we go
the `saved_gui_bmp` thing was... already kinda doing a similar thing? but it was conflicting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 22:19

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) k, so it's mostly working, need your help with one thing though
So, the minimap's colors work wonderfully
and if you open a dialog, the minimap's colors still show, wonderfully
....but if the window loses and regains focus, the minimap's colors blank out!
and I have no idea why
`zq/render.cpp`, `rti_mmap` is the node
it has a `bitmap`, but no `a4_bitmap`- it's drawn to directly via A5 draw commands
...and I see no reason why it should be changing in any way on the window losing and regaining focus

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 22:24

...oh, I just noticed one thing I can clean up. Doubt it'll fix anything though....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 22:27

yeah, no fix.
Ahk, enough of that, now on to the rest of the cset shit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 22:29

...ACK

so, that works beautifully!
....EXCEPT, it has the exact same issue!

tab out and back in, the a5 bitmap is cleared!

...ah wait

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 23:11

`ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE`
yep, that's it!
all fixed

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 23:17

Meant to ask, why's the new minimap have a grid? Or a second grid rather, because the two color squares are there to form a grid pattern in the first place

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 23:18

err, on the dmap page you mean?
Not intentional

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 23:20

or, oh, over the bottom too
also not intentional

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 23:22

I kinda like it in some situations. That being mainly when a palette has two of the same color for its map square

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 23:24

those are mostly only blank ones and ones that are divisible by 16
(the ones divisible by 16 *don't have an inner square*)
(which is because those were meant to be the 'overworld palettes' etc etc bullshit)

=== @ Moosh 02/23/2023 23:32

Personally I'd be perfectly fine with un-grandfathering that behavior.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 23:43

opinions?

Yeah I'm not feeling the longer middle rects

yeah, didn't think so either

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 01:42

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "It does."): ah, that only still works because it was compat ruled

I left a note on the PR.
Looks good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:17

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I left a note on the PR."): Those bitmaps overlay over the contents of the A4 bitmap for that node

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:18

as for using children nodes, I had done that, at one point

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/24/2023 02:18

Yes, my point is that then the child elements (if any) would then render above those
So overlay is a bad name

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:19

well, can you think  of a better name?
It's an overlay for the a4 bitmap
I just broke my brain for 8 hours getting this to work, and I'm pretty stoned, so not exactly in a naming type of headspace lol
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "as for using children nodes,…"): ^ So I had done this, but it felt pretty clunky to work with while I was doing it
having a direct set of a5 layers for the dialog node felt cleaner
....`layers`, could be a better name.
does that sound good?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:24

also, mechanically, the layers don't need separate data, and share a tint
so, for instance, if I make the walkability cheat displays an a5 layer like that
and if I were to give zscript the ability to tint the game screen with an a5 tint
that tint would apply automatically to the walkability layer as well (which would be the desired behavior)
(...probably)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/24/2023 02:28

adding another hierarchy to the render tree abstraction when it's already got one built in isn't cleaner. What was clunky about using the children? Just instantiating each item, or manipulating the children array?

It could maybe be a good idea if drawn after the children... I think doing it before the children turns it into a really weird construct.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:29

...idk anymore

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/24/2023 02:29

But if you're too high or tired to talk... Just merge when you're happy
I can play with it some

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:29

actually thinking it through it makes more sense how you said
IDK what was clunky, because that was 4 hours and 3 refactors ago
so
🤷‍♀️
feel free to change it to work how you said

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/24/2023 02:30

I can definitely see needing more functions for like, remove this RTI from children, or give me the index, or whatever. 

And maybe helper functions to make a RTI that is just a a5 bitmap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:31

mm, yeah, that would be helpful
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "feel free to change it to wor…"): if you do this, then feel free to merge + post a nightly
I gotta grab some food and chill for a bit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:33

ooh, no, I remember now
it was clunky when I tried it for the separate dialog windows
because that was directly tied with `popup_zqdialog_start()` and shit
but, that's using a vector of A4 bitmaps now, and doing that all in a4 before the render tree stuff
(that goes on the a4 bitmap of the rti_dialogs node

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 16:47

ahk, I've woken up and taken care of it
`add_dlg_layer` instead of `add_dlg_overlay`
adds a child rti node
instead of a bitmap to a vector
...still RETURNS the allegro bitmap, as that's the only thing the calling function needs a pointer to
also, `bool owned` added to rti nodes
if true, it considers itself to own its' pointers, and will attempt to delete them when it is destructed
the new nodes generated by `add_dlg_layer` have this set to true, other nodes all false

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 16:50

oh, also if ANY rti node is deleted, any of its' children that were `owned` are also deleted
...should be enough sanity to ensure no leaks there
bleh, though if I have a dialog with one of these layers that *opens another dialog*, it won't work, will it?
the layering is wrong and I need an entire other layer of rtis

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 17:08

...yeah
and that case needs to be handled
because

....GAAAAH
I've stumbled into quite a mess here
I'm just going to merge it how it was last night, that's functional enough for the most part, and gives extra csets
and hopefully @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) you can help me some
because right now I have shit mostly working
except when dialogs just kinda
decide to fucking
be invisible
and IDK why

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 18:43

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) merged what was working last night
pushed new branch with today's work
issue: dialogs keep being invisible
...and
uh

right there I got it to display it's A5 minimap layer which is a *child* of the dialog
but the main dialog... is not rendering?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 18:56

oh
fuck me
fucking constructor bullshit
nevermind connor I fixed it
