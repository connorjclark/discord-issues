Creator crashes everytime I attempt to open Quest->Init Data

=== @ vlamart 02/18/2022 01:48

Actually just tested it on a new quest and works fine. It seems to crash when there are absolutely no items (makes sense)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 01:48

Oh
That
That would be an odd edge-case

=== @ vlamart 02/18/2022 01:51

Very much so, for personal experimentation and organisation purposes, I was trying to make myself a completely blank of data templet. No items, enemies, sprites, etc., pure scratch

Guessing it'll be a quick fix
Once I get upstairs

So, because testing this requires deleting a bunch of items
I uh, got very tired very quickly of doing `rclick->paste` repeatedly
so, now, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+L` activate the `Copy`, `Paste`, `Save` and `Load` options from the rclick menu
(needs the Ctrl because typing normally searches)

Special handling case now displays this if no items are found
as, both the lister and the switcher full of checkboxes were *empty*
and thus when they reference their default option of `[0]`, they are uh, nullpo
so now, those gui objects just... don't exist at all if you don't have items

Thank you, I literally did it one by one, even with enemies and sprites, even though sprites was nice enough to copy the name too, so it was easier to sift through a bunch of "zz000"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 02:43

I only added it to items there, adding to the others is separate work unfortunately

Should have copy+paste+save+load with `Ctrl` for Items, Enemies, and Sprites
