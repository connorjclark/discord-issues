I don't know if it's just me, but I cannot open ZQuest.  I get an error message.  This is the latest nightly.

What Windows version are you on?

=== @ cbailey78 07/31/2023 00:04

Windows 7

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/31/2023 00:04

Not sure what uses this API but it was first introduced in Windows 8
Do you know the last nightly that worked?

=== @ cbailey78 07/31/2023 00:05

It was exactly one previous nightly before this latest nightly.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/31/2023 00:06

Can you specify the date string?
It's too easy for us to accidentally talk past each other
Currently not seeing anything in `nightly-2023-07-30` that would have added usage of this API

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/31/2023 00:09

> Retrieves the results of an overlapped operation on the specified file, named pipe, or communications device. To specify a timeout interval or wait on an alertable thread, use GetOverlappedResultEx.

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)
reading the API description here narrows it down

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/31/2023 00:10

> GetOverlappedResultEx is only supported on Windows 8 or later. If you want to be compatible with Windows 7, then you need to stick with GetOverlappedResult.

Obviously we won't do a special build for windows 7, so ignore the solution here. But can do something similar to what we do in `zc_get_monitor_scale`
(Or just use the older version always, if it works for us)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/31/2023 00:14

ah, fun.....

=== @ cbailey78 07/31/2023 00:16

I hope this doesn't mean I am forced to go out and buy a new computer or upgrade windows.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/31/2023 00:16

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "> GetOverlappedResultEx is on…"): `GetOverlappedResult` doesn't have a timeout, so that completely defeats the purpose
unless I'm missing something
this is legit the only way I could find to get timeout working
..also `zc_get_monitor_scale` hurts my head

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/31/2023 00:24

So what happens if we use the non timeout version just to get things to compile? We won't catch hangs on win7?
Seems fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/31/2023 00:32

...I suppose that's fine.
this and MAYBE #2557 if you care should be done before an alpha

Building next nightly now. @ cbailey78 please try it, ~30m
