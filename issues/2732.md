Running an SCC menu I'm watching my framerate slowly inch downwards to nothing and oh boy does this not spark joy. Thinking I broke something when I tweaked the refresh rate to fix the input bug üò¨

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) since I believe this is your system, any immediate suspects what could cause such a behavior?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2023 17:06

hhhahahahahahahahhaha
not a damn clue
this thing is cursed

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2023 17:07

oof

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2023 17:07

Most things I build, end up fucking *cursed af*
and get better over time
like lightbeams, super cursed
but my recent optimization makes them a lot lot lot cleaner

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2023 17:08

makes sense
this one is pretty cursed in concept altogether, but the end result is pretty cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2023 17:08

yep yep
that's the thing, you can't make good shit without making cursed shit
....well, most of the time
subscreen stuff is pretty damn clean
but that also took weeks of spending most of the day, and a ton of forward planning
and was converting an already-existing system, so, I suppose that doesn't really count does it
that was just me un-cursing the old subscreen stuff
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "that's the thing, you can't m‚Ä¶"): ...so this still applies, just, I had no hand in the cursed part this time
and frankly, the big problem with the scc menus
is that I didn't rewrite how strings work from the ground up
I had to work around the existing string system
which is fucking cursed bullshit
therefore there's not much that can be done to NOT be cursed

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2023 17:11

yeahhh
Here's hoping this one is just a stupid oversight and not a cursed conceptual problem. because it seems like it shouldn't be. Strings are confusing and all but it shouldn't be processing too much per frame

Wanna try the profiler in Visual studio?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2023 17:17

as soon as I saw connor typing my brain just went "he's about to suggest profiling, isn't he"

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/11/2023 17:17

Is this just more of that gui performance stuff I was working on?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2023 17:17

lol
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Is this just more of that gui‚Ä¶"): no this isn't gui
this is zc
like an npc asking you a yes/no question

Okay update on this, it's not the control codes. It's all strings in my quest. I think this has to do with an interaction between strings and generic scripts but I'm not entirely sure what

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2023 20:00

Are generic scripts even supposed to run during a Freeze All Action message? I think it's cool that they can but I noticed they weren't cleaning up script draws so I disabled them. Wondering if it was more than just the draws

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2023 20:02

they are intended to run during that, yes
pretty sure that was intentional anyway
....but if it's not clearing script draws, that, err, is a problem
as it would just stack them up infinitely and eat all your memory and fps
so that'd need to be fixed

=== @ Moosh 10/19/2023 10:17

(meta) thread name was changed: Slowdown caused by draws not clearing during frozen messages

=== @ Moosh 10/19/2023 10:22

Okay so I thought I'd ruled out draws being the culprit because I was checking for messages playing in my generic scripts, turns out I missed a couple spots and that was just it. 
```        if(!freezemsg)
        {
            if ( !FFCore.system_suspend[susptSCRIPDRAWCLEAR] ) script_drawing_commands.Clear();
        }```
It's happening here, because the draws don't clear but the generic script can still run, it will continue to accumulate more and more draws. A bit unclear on why this is able to go over the 1000 draw limit, but it shoots way past it and slows everything to a halt

=== @ Moosh 10/19/2023 10:28

So I imagine the solution here for having generic scripts work is just a script rule like "Draws Clear During Frozen Messages". But I'm a little unsure about how best to continue supporting the old behavior without triggering the bug. My thought is setting a bool FFCore.disablescriptdraws, and then checking that to break out of every draw instruction happening during the message. But that seems janky and gross. Don't suppose you can think of a cleaner way @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ?

Ah yes, the shrug of "jank it is" üòõ
