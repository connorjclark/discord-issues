Per @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 's directive, we will discuss the functionality here or if it's possible

Basically it comes down to "do I feel like taking a swing at it"
It's not out of the question, given that I did something kinda similar with palette expansion

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:40

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) , what exactly is the issue exactly expanding save file slots?  RAM usage?  Crashes?  All of the above?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:40

It's file stream stuff
You fuck up one tiny thing
You corrupt everything and everything crashes and nuke explodes and volcano erupt

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:41

Hrmmmmmmm

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:43

This is a known feature request and should be physically possible, if there any way it can be started with one addition then move on, or am I completely wrong on that?
I certainly know file stream stuff can be very tricky

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:44

Like
This needs a full rewrite of how saves work
Which also, if you think about it
Means a rewrite of how the *save select* works
So, uh, it'll require a LOT of work
And it all has to be done at once
Because if you were to do any part of it without finishing, then well, you wouldn't be able to play any quests at all

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:45

We do have stopgaps with ZCL and the test feature being done, so this doesn't have to be like tomorrow's thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:46

The test feature, for reference, was 100x easier than save expansion will be

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:46

It's also very much appreciated

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 20:46

the big thing is rewriting save selection

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:47

This is a huge overhaul, which needs to be done slowly and carefully, by someone insane enough

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 20:47

that's a bunch of tedious gui work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:47

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) my idea would be dialog loader
So just a new gui system popup for save selection

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 20:47

I mean I've been considering doing it anyways because the 8 character limit on save names bugs me so much

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:48

If I were to ask you to do this on behalf of the community, what would be your ETA or version to do it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:48

No ETA

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:48

Without stressing you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:48

It'll happen if/when it happens
Too complex to make any estimate

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:49

Literally one typo could cost days of debugging with something like this
So

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 20:50

ETA implies a linear production
more likely it'll be "oh hey I'm bored with nothing to do and I feel like doing something magical" one morning and it'd be out in a day or two

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:50

I tried exactly that already, but it burned through all my energy
And just didn't work at all

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:51

@ HeroOfFireZC @<role: Tester> Please input on this thread your views but just to reiterate, this is not a "do it now" priority.  I'd like to see this done eventually
This RN is more of a roundtable discussion

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:55

My basic hope would be:
`saves/` folder to hold all save files
Dialog loader system, allowing loading any save file or making a new one
Save *file* name and character name separate, enter both on create new file.

Due to file system, it might take longer to load each save (as it would load from file each time you load, instead of only on launch). However, this would also mean crashing would no longer lose progress saved once you return to the menu, as it would write the data to file then.

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:56

Sounds reasonable
See how the general testing group feels about it, as I don't want to speak for everyone

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 20:57

This requires:
-rewriting a lot of save file code
- completely replacing the save select screen with a completely new dialog
Which, while only 2 bullet points, is a fucking lot

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:58

Keep us informed @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 20:59

(replying to @ NightmareJames "See how the general testing g…"): I mean, whether or not it gets done is ultimately up to the two people capable of doing it

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 20:59

As I said, absolutely no rush

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 21:01

ZCL and the new testing feature should provide people with 99+ save slots for now

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/16/2022 21:04

Can you clarify what you mean by "load every time you load instead of launch"? What would this effect, and what would remain unchanged load-time wise. I assume it just means the file select menu and loading the quest is slower, so F6->Retry would be a bit slower, anything else?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/16/2022 21:06

Depending on the scope of this rewrite, this might not make sense a 2.55 feature. The question is, how much effort would a smaller improvement be? Namely number of save slots increased, and size of save file name increased?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 21:06

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Can you clarify what you mean…"): Yes
(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Depending on the scope of thi…"): You can already use multiple `.sav`s with zcl
Save name length will require the title screen rewrite

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/16/2022 21:11

Hmm... I'd say set this idea aside for now (or play around with it in a side build), and maybe consider attempting it when the 2.55 to-do list is smaller. This re-write sounds like a big commitment, and better focused on if there was a "stable" 2.55 build that didn't need updates for a good while.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 21:15

To be fair, we've done some fairly extensive rewrites of systems already
it just takes one of us having enough energy in a burst to plow through it

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 21:18

I'm in agreement, I'll just make a video on how to manip save files
We can do this at a better time

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 21:20

I don't think we're that computer illiterate as a community where we can't use Windows copy and paste.  🤣

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/16/2022 21:39

I don't recall where I've last seen this done, but I know there have been games with "experimental builds" that are dedicated to massive changes like this. That is one way I could see this happening "short term". I'm just concerned that working on it now could derail other development. This does not sound like a change you put into a nightly build and call it done, there will likely be weeks of testing.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/16/2022 21:42

It does sound worth doing at some point though, the question is when is a good time to put all the development and testing focus on it.

=== @ NightmareJames 02/16/2022 23:43

Yeah, this might need a side/experimental build
