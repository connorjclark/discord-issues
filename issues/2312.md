SFX used when an enemy fires its weapon

Default sounds (for when importing old quests into 2.55)
Boomerang: 4
Flame and Flame 2: 13
Magic and Whirlwind: 32
Fireball and Fireball (Rising): 40
Rock: 51

(Unsure how to handle Lit Bombs/Super Bombs, though Rocks have a death sound in LTTP so adding a 2nd sound option [or having the second sound be the one immediately following the previous in the list] might be neat)

For lit bombs, leave it as 0 (silent).

Yeah, which also is used for arrows and swords, but I didn't include that info because I thought it was already known
