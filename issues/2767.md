It would be rather useful to be able to essentially store counter values using one of the many custom counters. The simplest use case for this would be in minigames, where the player is supposed to have a limited supply of arrows separate from what they had upon entering the game. Their normal arrow count can be stored in custom counter 1 and the minigame overwrites the arrow ammo counter with the desired amount for the game. Once the game is over, a string sets the arrow ammo counter equal to what was stored in custom counter 1 and custom counter 1 is subsequently cleared. 

Essentially, having this feature, combined with the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division control codes that already exist for individual counters, can turn these custom counters into open memory addresses for the quest-maker to manipulate without scripts.

Bare minimum, it would be nice to be able to set counters equal to other counters.

Additionally, having a string control code check for a counter to be a specific value instead of just >= would help.
