@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) I know you were wanting to work on this, it needs to happen at some point. I would love to work on it *with you* if you have the time sometime?

This would probably be a total rewrite suggestion, but if it could be done "now", neat: separate number of frames, movement, and specials. So you can freely choose something like 2-frame 8-direction flying and firing; or something like that
