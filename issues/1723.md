Starting with nightly 2022-07-08, ZQ runs at around 2 times CPU usage. I presume this has something to do with the ability to resize the window.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 18:38

How certain are you about that date? I kind of figured it would have started since allegro 5
You tried the one just before ?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 18:40

That nightly also has some changes to the timer code, could be that

=== @ Bagel Meister 07/09/2022 18:41

maybe
I tried going back from the most recent build, and the first one to be in x64 was the first build i found that runs normally
Before this, i used that build for a while and noticed no problems, then upgraded today and it started

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 18:44

Cool, thanks for the deets

=== @ Bagel Meister 07/09/2022 18:45

np, hope i'm right about the date

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 20:00

Did you start using 64 bit? I think 64-bit is the one that goes sicko mode on the CPU. 

32-bit allegro 5 build from 6/20 still has normal CPU usage.

(i'm only testing using ZCL since its the same shit)

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 20:07

**TL;DR: **

Last build before allegro 5 jump: low CPU usage (<1-2%) 

32-bit allegro 5 second release build: low CPU usage (<1-2%

First 64-bit build: elevated CPU usage (~13-15%)
32-bit build accompanying first 64-bit build: elevated CPUusage (~13-15%)

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 20:12

Latest nightly 64-bit: Ass% (30-ish)
latest nightly 32-bit: Ass% (ditto)

I'll check that out tomorrow, it's getting late here, but thanks

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 23:30

test build ready in ~20m https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases
should fix, please check. And check the slow MIDI tempo bug hasnt returned

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 00:07

@ Bagel Meister @ Majora test build ready

=== @ Majora 07/10/2022 00:07

o7

=== @ Majora 07/10/2022 00:09

yooooo
out of the gate, ZCL and ZC CPU usage slashed roughly in half
ZQuest about -33% (of previous max) usage. From 30 to 17-22
around 13-15% for ZCL and 11-13% in ZC
big noticeable performance improvement, is the takeaway

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 00:21

coolio
midi still ok?
sounded fine to me
but just double checking

=== @ Majora 07/10/2022 00:21

oh I'll play a MIDI

=== @ Majora 07/10/2022 00:23

yeah MIDI sounds flawless in ZQ

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 00:24

coolio

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 01:17

@ Majora newer release, same link above
how much better is it now??
just zquest changed

=== @ Majora 07/10/2022 01:18

I will check in a few mins and ping you with info

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 01:18

ok thx
i'd check but you're already the benchmark/baseline lol

=== @ Majora 07/10/2022 01:18

plus my computer is ancient so differences are much more noticeable o7

=== @ Majora 07/10/2022 01:25

ZQuest fresh launch now only uses about 15-17% of my CPU @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
edges up another percent if I maximize the window

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2022 01:28

nice
also, no edging plz

=== @ Bagel Meister 07/10/2022 13:03

Sorry ive been out, i'll check now

=== @ Bagel Meister 07/10/2022 13:11

Oh my god, not only is it better, it's way better than before. I'd say it's about 40% less cpu than before the cpu usage doubled.
This is incredible, what did you do to fix it?
