EDIT:  Thread name changed in accordance to later discussion tidbits.

This is a completely stupid idea and I have no idea how well it would work within ZQuest.

The concept is, there's a combo type, just like any other, that wouldn't do anything _on its own._  The only thing you can do with it is list as its Attribute 1 and Attribute 2 a beginning and end range of combos, respectively.  That's literally all that you'd do with it.

What that would do is immediately replace the combo you just placed on the map with one of the combos from within the range of that combo's attributes.

This would be used to put down random combos that are just floor decorations.  If you have ten different piles of bones or forest floor leaf arrangements, and don't want to be bothered to have to place them one at a time in random locations, all you'd have to do is define your range as the ten combos of bones or leaves, and just put down that random combo that you made that represents that range of bones over and over and over again all over the screen where you want random leaves or bones.

....then they would change every time you re-enter the screen
that'd look really weird

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 03/05/2022 20:01

Well, it would be a ZQuest-internal thing that the combo you put down wouldn't remain there.  It would immediately be replaced by one of the combos in the range that was defined.  You'd never actually see the "Random" combo in-game, or even on the map in ZQuest.

But I don't know if that's even remotely possible in ZQuest, to replace a combo with another.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:01

that isn't how combo types work
if it were a combo type, it gets handled in ZC

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 03/05/2022 20:01

I figured.  Thanks anyway!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:01

to add some sort of ZQuest *tool* might be possible
but definitely not a combo type
because like, a script can change a combo's type
so scripts could place them mid-gameplay
and that... obviously wouldn't do what you want

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 03/05/2022 20:02

Mm, as long as people are interested in such a tool.   It needn't be a script for anything mid-game.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:11

something like an alias
basically

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:11

yeah i think a right click to enable random combo mode and also in the right click menu you can enter what range of random combos (contiguous in the combo table) you want would be neato
like if you wanted one of 10 combos
you'd click the first combo
set random combo range to 10
enable random combo mode
and start drawing (using the first combo to draw being the key thing here so zquest knows where you want it to select from)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 03/05/2022 20:12

I can see that being functional in terms of GUI access, yes.
(meta) thread name was changed: Feature to place random combos with the combo brush.

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:13

so you don't have to enter a combo range or anything it just works if you have the table set up right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:14

eh
or it could be a field on aliases
so you can save an alias to be a random range of combos
which would also allow 2x2 and such

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/05/2022 20:29

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)"): hmmmm
Having it as a combo type *could* work, if it's just "this turns into another combo automatically"
Use a noise pattern combined with X, Y, screen pos, and map number to get a unique pattern per screen that's consistent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:33

Eww
Far more complicated than it needs to be

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:33

yeah yuck no

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:33

I think adding it to aliases would be better

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:34

i think it should be baked into the quest file instead of using an algorithm
that way, you can manually tweak it too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:34

It shouldn't be a combo type
Period
It shouldn't have anything to do with ZC
Only ZQ

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:34

^

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:34

Which means it can't be a combo type
But aliases are perfect

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:35

also making it not a combo type allows it to be used with anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:35

?
The way it was suggested as a combo type wouldn't have had issues like that

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:35

oh whoops

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:36

But, it would change every time you reenter the screen
Or be algorithmically hardcoded
Both of which are blatantly bad

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:36

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "But, it would change every ti‚Ä¶"): deedee said it wouldn't because it would be seeded the same every time
which is bad yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:37

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Or be algorithmically hardcod‚Ä¶"): ^
You're really good at just missing half of my text

=== @ P-Tux7 03/05/2022 20:38

sorry i was typing while you were and we posted it at the same time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 20:38

Oh, that must be some serious lag
You posted almost a full minute after I did

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 03/05/2022 20:42

That lag has happened to me before.  I don't even question it anymore.  üò¥

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/05/2022 22:18

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Or be algorithmically hardcod‚Ä¶"): having a noise seed in the combo type would fix it, but that's still overly complicated and doesn't need to be like that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 22:20

it shouldn't need to be in zc at all
it should be entirely handled in zq

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/05/2022 22:24

okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2022 22:24

frankly having it be part of aliases makes a lot of sense
as that allows larger than 1x1 effects of this
and, it would choose which random combo to place when you place the alias
so if you want to change it you can just place it multiple times to cycle through
