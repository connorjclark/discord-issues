This is a very rare issue I've run into, possibly not a bug. More than seeing it fixed, I'd like to first understand why ZC is doing this.

So I made a set of enemy sprites in Aseprite and wanted to rip them into ZC.
ZC has having none of it and not rendering them in the right colors. So I tried ripping the palette data from the image and ZC gave me this

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893736095689342988/893736446400294922/unknown.png?ex=65ebf86d&is=65d9836d&hm=77418c544112ddb7c2735c1f010364293a1e4eda314b2e944d6cab581f141321&)
The starting row in that palette features all the colors in the image. Would normally be indicative of something being saved incorrectly
The thing is, my palette in Aseprite looks like this. Aseprite disagrees with ZC on what this image's palette is

And when I open it in Gimp, same result

Both programs agree that the image is indexed and only ZC is disagreeing and giving me that wacky palette. I suspect this has something to do with ZC being as old as time, could be it ignores some parts of the PNG format that more modern programs are catching
So I'd like to figure out where it's getting this palette data from and how to save it correctly in these other programs so that ZC respects it

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 05:55

For comparison, when I saved the same image as a BMP it worked fine. But that doesn't particularly surprise me

=== @ NightmareJames 10/02/2021 09:46

I'm actually going to second this.  I noticed palettes can be off when translating from Paint Shop Pro unless I do special things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 10:49

(replying to @ Moosh "For comparison, when I saved‚Ä¶"): ^ This is what I was going to suggest as a fix
I have no fucking clue why this would do this, but bitmap is the image type ZC uses, so it makes sense that that would work better

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 10:52

So at no point does ZC itself read the image headers? It's all allegro witchcraft?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 10:52

I have no idea
what menu are you doing this in, exactly?

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 10:55

Grab menu initially. Colors went all fucky so I went to investigate. Same behavior in the palette grabber

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 10:56

Now what it looks like it's done is what happens when you try to rip in a non indexed image
In which case it auto generates a palette for it

where palette grabber
oh

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 10:57

Quest->Graphics->Palettes->Main and then Grab

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 10:57

duh
can you send the original png image?

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 10:57

Already did, very start of the thread

here's a repost

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 10:58

oh bleh
I literally didn't see it because it blended in XD

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 11:12

Umm
Nothing we can do about this
it all occurs within allegro
fun times

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2021 11:13

alas. Well good to know it's not on me. Or at least I can't figure out why it's on me
Might be some setting in gimp that'd do it. I had problems loading images on 1.92 in the past until I fiddled with some shit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 11:14

Best of luck
marking unfixable

Hate this as well, but glad to know
Thank you @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)

Allego bitmaps use a specific format of indexed colour: Modern Windows ` .bmp` is not the sane format as pre-XP `.bmp.`

You can use TARGA (as I recall) to avoid some of these issues.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:38

The modern bmp works fine

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:38

I believe that I had to use TARGA when I edited the packfile contents.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:38

It's an indexed png that fails
(replying to @ Moosh "For comparison, when I saved‚Ä¶"): ^

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:40

Indexed PNG is a whole diff beast, but (e.g.) MS Paint BMP files are no longer compliant with the spec for AG4.
PNG as also undergone internal revisions that alpng.lib does not understand.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:41

Aye. So, unfixable until potentially AL5+AL might fix it.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:41

TARGA TIFF and AIFF have been pretty nuch static for twenty--plus years
Possibly yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:41

So, 3.0

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:41

for whenever we a toss in our hats and start that update
Anyway, it is a library problem caused b changes to the data format.
