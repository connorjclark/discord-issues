Requested to put this up by Emily so she doesn't forget.
``Graphics->GetTilePixel(tile, cset, x, y)``
This would get the colour data of a given pixel of the given tile in the tile table.
The primary purpose of such a function would be to analyse the colour contents of a tile without needing to blit it to a bitmap and thus not have to deal with frame delays like what ``Bitmap->GetPixel()`` does.

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 07:40

@ Orithan Is the cset arg necessary when you can add cset * 16 to the result?

=== @ Orithan 10/23/2023 07:40

Maybe not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:28

(replying to @ Moosh "@ Orithan Is the…"): you would need to handle 8-bit tho
because like, you don't add anything if the tile is 8-bit
I would probably add cset as the LAST arg though
so it can have a default value of 0, able to be omitted
(...maybe make x/y first then so tile/cset are still next to each other?)

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:29

Good point and that'd be smart

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:30

nice thing is, default values actually do have optimizations when used, so there is purpose to that

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:30

Could also add `Is8Bit(tile)`, though I can't imagine there's many more use cases for that than this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:30

(replying to @ Moosh "Could also add `Is8Bit(tile)`…"): I mean, there's `Graphics->IsBlankTile[214500];`

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:31

hmm, true

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:31

so could add a matching 8-bit checker

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:31

Yeah that's probably worth

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:31

...being able to toggle the 8-bit status of a tile by writing to it might be neat too
(IsBlankTile is read-only... or, at least I would assume so, it does not actually list that in the docs, so that should be updated)
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...being able to toggle the 8…"): err, except you'd want to set a cset if you were writing it to true....
so that probably would need to be separate if exist at all

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:32

Being able to toggle 8-bit would be cool. How...possible is that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:33

(You can do it with draw commands already)
(via `bitmap->WriteTile()`)

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:33

oh right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:33

but that has the draw command delay
...given, most cases where you would probably want to change 8-bit, you probably also want to edit the graphic somehow...
so, unsure if worthwhile

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:33

yeahhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:34

might be best to leave it at the read-only array like IsBlankTile, then
so `Graphics->GetTilePixel(int x, int y, int tile,int cset=0);`, and `bool Is8bTile[214500];`
also err, writing to 8-bit without it being a draw command... would probably be fucky with draw order stuff anyway
.....fuck, my brain just, no, why do I suddenly get ideas

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:36

mildly bugs me putting this under Graphics when all the other tile stuff is global.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:36

(replying to @ Moosh "mildly bugs me putting this u…"): err? what tile stuff is global?
oh, err, copy stuff
yeah, bleh

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:36

CopyTile, SwapTile, OverlayTile yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:37

to match how `Game->` went to `Audio->` for audio stuff we should honestly put those in `Graphics->` too
...except, well
undocumenting *global* functions sounds a bit more troublesome than undocumenting *pointer'd* functions
....though we have done it with some, so, meh
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ".....fuck, my brain just, no,…"): anyway uhhh

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:38

I noticed Rand() is undocumented and this greatly discheeses me because I still use it all the time, can't get used to the randgen range differences 😛

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:38

...how about this crazy fucking idea
.... `bool bitmap->Immediate;`
if set to true, all drawing commands execute IMMEDIATELY, ignoring their layer argument
....It would be fucky with some stuff, for sure, like trying to blit anything related to `RT_SCREEN`

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:39

hey guess what I was also contemplating

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:39

(either to or fro)

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:39

I don't think it's worth

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:39

It could be useful for a lot of script setup stuff though
and would give immediate `GetPixel` access

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:40

Reading to / writing from tiles are basically the sole exception where the draw delay can screw you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:41

(replying to @ Moosh "Reading to / writing from til…"): how about external image files?

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:41

Though if you're considering doing that I should probably drop  this idea as it'd be obsoleted

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:41

well, no
GetTilePixel would be FAR faster an operation
for the use case of single tiles specifically

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:41

By how much? You load the bitmap, you do many getpixel operations on the bitmap all in a row

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:42

but you have to DRAW to the bitmap still

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:42

Depending on the use case you may not need to redraw the bitmap as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:42

GetTilePixel doesn't need to do any draw operations AT ALL
Immediate is *specifically based around draw commands*, so you need to run a draw operation to use it
depending on the use case, it could be significant enough to care about performance
(...probably less so given connor is a beast at optimizing shit, but, still)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:44

so,
`int GetTilePixel(int x, int y, int tile, int cset = 0);` - for instant easy reads from unmodified tiles, and nothing else
`bool Graphics->Is8bTile[214500];` (read-only)
`bool bitmap->Immediate;` - for instant draws of any complexity, including file loading, multiple overlaid tiles, etc
also, like
`GetTilePixel` should take... 10 minutes if that to implement?
`bitmap->Immediate` will be a large undertaking requiring a TON of work
so 🤷‍♀️ why NOT add the easier thing, if it's also helpful?

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:46

true

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:46

and you can get it out faster

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:46

```10 minutes if that to implement```
it takes me 10 minutes to get my lazy ass to open VS tho 🙃

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:49

(replying to @ Moosh "```10 minutes if that to impl…"): ```cpp
unpack_tile(newtilebuf, tile, 0, false);
ret = 10000*(unpackbuf[y*16+x]);
break```
...plus, err, cset handling
```cpp
unpack_tile(newtilebuf, tile, 0, false);
int csoffs = newtilebuf[tile].format == tf8bit ? 0 : cset*16;
ret = 10000*(unpackbuf[y*16+x] + csoffs);
break```
(here `tile`/`cset`/`x`/`y` obviously are the params, and `newtilebuf`/`unpackbuf` are globals)

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:51

Oh yeah what should I name the placeholder opcodes for leftover from the old GETTILEPIXELR and SETTILEPIXELR

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:51

...or, you could make a helper function in tiles.cpp that basically does the same as the zscript function
(replying to @ Moosh "Oh yeah what should I name th…"): 🤷‍♀️ look at what `Graphics->GetPixel` is named for opcode
match style
for the non-leftover
for leftover like... idk, reserve them for you the same way we have been reserving stuff?

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:53

No, I mean there's two useless opcodes. Should I just call them RESRVD_OP_MOOSH_EX_1, or some sort?
sounds good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:53

keep in mind that for adding NEW opcodes/registers, once you run out of reserved ones, you can use `expand_zscript.py` to automate adding more

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:54

yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:54

(have you used that yet?)

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:54

still if I want to add an assorted function here or there I can write over these ones too, since they were unused anyways
Have not used the script yet because I don't add a lot of ZScript

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 08:54

I mentioned `once you run out of reserved ones`

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1165825773228277760/1165936477771931648/image.png?ex=65e58c76&is=65d31776&hm=61d46c2bcf5cfe17d03116df25edcab4817d335970e96cb6f7a81a05dae7f9bf&)
but yeah, it can handle registers, and opcodes of any of Opcode/UnaryOpcode/BinaryOpcode
and can `--listfile` to add a bunch typed out in a file
so cool

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 08:56

nifty

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 10:51

(replying to @ Moosh "it takes me 10 minutes to get…"): See, I did a lengthy test run in the editor to be sure that the functions worked properly for their intended purposes and then got distracted by a conversation and forgot to push changes. What'd I tell ya? 😛
Anyways, done

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 10:58

You did tile,x,y,cset thoo

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 10:59

?
Was that not what you suggested?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 10:59

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so,
`int GetTilePixel(int x,…"): ^
Tile not next to cset?
Also you did a setter
That needs mention in docs about layer shit
Re: that it occurs instantly and thus occurs before any draws for the frame

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 11:00

Oh yeah, good point

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 11:02

I guess no harm in revising some stuff before anybody has a chance to use it. Tile before cset doesn't really bother me because while that'd put the two together it'd also put more important information (the tile) after less important info (the pixel position)
And that feels wrong to me. But draw commands do that as well so nbd

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 11:09

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Tile not next to cset?"): Actually wait no, on thinking it through further I'm strongly in favor of tile being the leftmost argument. Draws have X and Y first because they're a position to draw the tile which comes next. Tile in this case is information necessary to contextualize the X and Y. So having the X and Y come first feels HEAVILY wrong because the meaning of those positions are _dependent on the tile_

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 11:17

(replying to @ Moosh "Actually wait no, on thinking…"): that's why `tile,cset,x,y` would be best
but you can't do that if you want optional args
since those need to be last

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 11:17

If it really bothers you I'll do that and just make the cset non optional.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 11:17

nah, not doing the optional would bother me more
you're fine

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 11:18

alrighty
