Setting the enemies to spawn using the wizard does not save, as it reverts back to (NONE) after hitting ok.

I can see the enemies I set for it are saved here also

Also out of curiosity I modified the default enemy it was using for the ghini (enemy 36) to one of the enemies I wanted, and nothing spawned.

...why is it still labelled as attribytes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/14/2023 06:27

...because the `Specify` flag is not checked, that isn't being saved right
~~Also, grave combos.... don't appear at first glance to support 2 enemies.~~ NEVERMIND! They do.
Do note that every single combo wizard is basically its' own custom dialog, so yeah, individual types can have their own bugs. Nice catch, thanks.

@ Deathrider confirm when you can please

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Deathrider confirm…"): Can do tonight

This works. The non floating enemies seem to spawn not near the grave but they do spawn
