The fact there are internal ZScript arrays named solely for ``Ghost.zh`` and ``Tango.zh`` bugs me to no end because it puts in the idea that these headers are supposed to be the be all and end all for NPC and text processing scripts respectively. The two headers shown their age, with no sign of proper 2.55 updates coming, and it doesn't take into account the possibility of other headers which may be used for the same purpose being made.
It should be simple to add alternative tokens which compile to ``Game->Ghost[]`` and ``Game->Tango[]`` like ``Game->NPCRAM[]`` and ``Game->TextRAM[]`` or some other names.
