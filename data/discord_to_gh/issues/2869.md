if I click in the autocombo setup dialog, and then click on the Type dropdown, if I then a) scrolll with my mouse wheel or b) click, and double click to select, or c) single click a type and click enter, zq crashes. Specific version info in screenshot, should be latest 2.55 nightly. Curiously, if I go down to "positional tiling" or "replace" those do not crash zq for me.

Can't repro, can anyone else?

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 12/04/2023 03:01

Maybe it got fixed since?

I only tried on Mac. Can you still get it to crash on Windows?

If I get the chance I'll test it later.
