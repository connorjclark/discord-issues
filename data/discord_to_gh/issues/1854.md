When I try to compile my script into my quest, and assign slots, it says everything was successful with the close button and all. Then Zquest crashes.

Crashes specifically when I try to add `mp->ComboC[ComboAt(this->X+8, this->Y+8)] = this->CSet;` after line 575

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "ASAN report attached"): Stared at that for a bit going `Jesus what the fuck`, but then noticed a thing and I might have the bug fixed.

seeing that at the top was all I needed
`escstr_size` is looping through a char const* buffer
....turns out, the buffer was not properly null-terminated for some calls, thus, out of bounds.
just added a sanity nullchar at the right spot, should prevent that from going into random memory

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/13/2022 22:26

I did this in xcode/clang, but BTW in visual studio there's the same kind of tool https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/sanitizers/asan?view=msvc-170

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/14/2022 01:18

Ok i updated the Alpha build and quest still crashed editor after compiling and pressing ok.
Daniel tried this too. I am waiting for him to try another quest with a completely different script to see if it does the same thing.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/14/2022 04:11

Daniel has tested a different quest with a completely different script and that still crashes from the same thing too.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/15/2022 04:27

We just updated to the latest Alpha and Crashing still happens after compiling : (
today

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/15/2022 09:56

I'm running into the same isssues

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2022 14:47

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "I'm running into the same iss‚Ä¶"): If you are referring to what you talked about in the other channel, no, that can't be this issue. File a separate report.

=== @ vlamart 09/15/2022 15:07

I also just recently tested this and am still having the same crash

Oh no, what does üí• mean?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2022 01:01

crash

=== @ vlamart 09/17/2022 01:50

Would just separating the scripts and using `#include` be a work around for this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 01:50

?? huh?
what would that do at all?

=== @ vlamart 09/17/2022 01:51

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Literally just having _any_ ideas

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 01:51

zquest has nothing to do with the compiling process
zscript.exe handles that
so if zquest.exe is crashing
it has nothing to do with parsing the script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 01:57

and, here's the thing
*nothing anyone but a dev can do is a solution here*
because *you aren't doing anything wrong to cause a crash*
it's crashing because a bug needs to be fixed
and crashes should be fairly simple if we can scan the crash reports
I fixed one crash issue already, which I mentioned above
thanks to the crash report connor posted
though, connor is the only one who can SEE the crash reports, and to change that costs $$$
and I haven't reproduced a crash in the attempts I've made, soooo
not much I can do without more from connor

=== @ vlamart 09/17/2022 02:01

Fair enough, just trying to clog a hole with a finger I guess

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/17/2022 06:19

I just compiled the script 2 times and it crashed the second time.
i updated to latest alpha and still did this.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 13:45

yes, no one did any new fixes
so nothing changed
there was nothing new to test

=== @ vlamart 09/17/2022 14:18

Same exact problem as the very top of this thread. This time, after that test:
1. I deleted one of my smaller scripts and added that line I was trying to add and it still crashes.
2. I then opened a new quest and just slapped a random script on it and it compiled fine with no crash.
3. I then went back to my quest, tried deleting an even bigger script and then adding the line and it crashed again.
4. Then I tried compiling it again with no changes at all and it _still_ crashes.

I think she (the script) just too thicc

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/17/2022 18:57

ZC never used to crash like this.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 18:58

SLG, *YES WE KNOW*
*SOMETHING IS WRONG AND BROKEN*
*GIVE US TIME*

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/17/2022 18:59

Ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 19:19

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) whenever you can, if you could post any more relevant-seeming crash report screenshots?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/17/2022 20:36

I'm not around for a bit. Try the ASAN thing though in visual studio, that's gonna be the useful report if this is a memory corruption. You need to be able to reproduce it, though.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 20:41

where is that?

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/17/2022 23:56

I can confirm this happens to me, too. And it happens every time.

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 00:00

I noticed the entire screen blacks out after the message says compiling successful. Then it brings me to the script menu. After the success menu (with the win game sfx) zquest closes.

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> another duplicate because people don't know how to see if something has already been reported
#1875

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 21:30

So apparently it doesn't actually happen *every* time. Because today it seemed to compile fine.
But it still looks like it could be a problem. So I'll make sure to save every time I compile.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/18/2022 21:53

If you compile like 2 or 3 times it eventually crashes again.
Even though the first time compiled ok.

=== @ vlamart 09/18/2022 21:56

Haha mine never makes it past the first one üòù

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/18/2022 22:02

If you saved every time you compiled it means you ran out of chances to compile from this bug.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:04

???
So, wait, saving changes the state?
Thaaat..... indicates that something is corrupting the quest's data
which would be quite bad

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/18/2022 22:08

i kept original version of my quest before ever compiling when this bug first happened.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:09

good, and I would recommend the same to anyone else experiencing this issue
....given, I recommend that when upgrading versions, always, for this very reason
always make backups when upgrading

=== @ vlamart 09/18/2022 22:09

I literally backed up the day before these began too üòé

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:15

If anyone could make a test quest that can cause this issue, that would be great
because nothing I've tried has caused it

=== @ vlamart 09/18/2022 22:16

Does the quest I posted at the very top work for your test?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:17

ah, didn't scroll up enough
it might
I'll look probably after dinner

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/18/2022 22:25

Um, i think try one of moosh's large script quests.
Either that or i could send my quest
Oh wait
a fresh quest?   Daniel has done that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:26

your quest is literally the worst possible test quest

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/18/2022 22:26

ill ask him

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:26

it is *HUGE*

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/18/2022 22:26

Oi
Daniel can make one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:26

the point of a test quest is to be as close to a completely blank quest as possible, but still cause the issue

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/18/2022 22:27

He has made a fresh new quest and inserted another script and it has still happened.
i gotta wake him up first.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:27

no rush
It isn't just ANY quest with scripts, as, I tried several and couldn't get any of them to crash
so it has to be something specific

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/18/2022 22:29

They have to be large scripts.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:29

I would bet that it isn't just large scripts
it's probably something very specific
Large scripts have a lot more in them, which means a lot more likely to happen to have whatever specific thing it is

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/18/2022 22:30

(replying to @ vlamart "Does the quest I posted at th‚Ä¶"): How large is your script?

=== @ vlamart 09/18/2022 23:16

(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl "How large is your script?"): Posted at the top as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 03:33

And before someone mentions it
No, the nightly that is about to be posted does NOT fix this.
Didn't even look at it yet
I'll take a look tomorrow if I have the energy, but I don't have too much energy lately

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/19/2022 03:44

Yeah it's hard to test this out because it seems to happen at the most random times.
If this happens to you just restart your computer and reopen it.
