I'm only suggesting this because conveyors exist at the moment. (So something _similar_ can kind of be done maybe.)  

A "Steps" Combo  (Rather than a Step->Next Combo.)  is a combo that adjusts the player's position based on the direction they're moving.

For example, if I have a Steps combo shaped like ``` / ``` I would set its offset to `y = -1` for every pixel to the right I moved, which would move them upward by the same amount.  Or if it was a shallow step, I'd set it to  `y = -.5` for a half step up.

The combo would require customizable options rather than be something hardcoded because of the following:

1)  Its uses are flexible.  There are 8 directions steps could go in.  Wind could push someone in a specific direction.  They could walk into or against the wind and have different movement effects based on it.
2)  It could have the ability to lock certain cardinal directions from being moved in while on a particular stair combo.
3)  It differs from a conveyor in that when the player isn't moving, nothing is happening. They just stand still.  Even conveyors can't do that.
