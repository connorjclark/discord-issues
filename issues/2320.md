This is in latest nightly. FFCs used to snap to half steps when placed. They no longer do and just get placed directly at mouse location.

*WOW* uhhh
so fun times
Apparently them snapping to the half grid was a bug to begin with
and only happened in large mode
(small mode snapped to the WHOLE grid, not the half grid)
...and compact mode uses a third screen size, so it's snapping to some weird third grid that doesn't line up right

...should be fixed.
