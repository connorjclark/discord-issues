=== @ Russ 01/21/2023 17:37

Tested on the newest nightly. It gives a C++ error, apparently
[Info] Compiling the ZQuest buffer...
[Info] Pass 1: Parsing
[Info] Pass 2: Preprocessing
[Info] Pass 3: Registration
[Info] Pass 4: Analyzing Code
[Error] An unexpected runtime error has occurred:
invalid vector subscript
[Info] Failure!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/21/2023 17:37

I should probably add a parser option to have it spit out the full traceback for messages like this

=== @ Russ 01/21/2023 17:37

I can provide the script file to the devs to try to compile. The header environment is... a but unwieldy. It could be optimized for 2.55 but I mostly just want to get it compiling at all and I'm not really planning to dev it anymore

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/21/2023 17:38

I'd need the full everything compiling properly to test ANYTHING, yeah
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I should probably add a parse‚Ä¶"): ....unless I do this, in which case you can just give me the new better error message

=== @ Russ 01/21/2023 17:38

That would work too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/21/2023 17:38

....just started feeling a headache though, so, gonna wait for later

=== @ Russ 01/21/2023 17:39

Fair enough

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/22/2023 09:27

....I
fucking expected this
to be `add 1 function call`
because why the fuck would it not be `add 1 function call`
instead, I have to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
How the fuck do I get a stack trace for an exception as a string

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/22/2023 18:07

I don't know, but I found this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/37227893
also, I think if we re-throw in ScriptParser then at least sentry will pick up on it.
In the meantime, you can just run in debug mode and break on the problem, if you're just trying to see what it is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/22/2023 21:33

Aye, but running in debug mode means I need to set up compiling that ungodly set of scripts üò≠

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2023 19:10

I think this is how we can capture a handled exception for sentry: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/blob/master/examples/example.c#L331-L341

=== @ Russ 02/14/2023 11:37

Did you even figure out how to get this to display, Emily? Would it be easier to just send the Yuurand setup to you so you can try compiling it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/14/2023 11:45

(replying to @ Russ "Did you even figure out how t‚Ä¶"): probably
ü§¢

=== @ Russ 02/14/2023 12:44

lol
Alright, I‚Äôll send it your way when I can

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/14/2023 13:33

yeah, whenever you can. Probably an important fix to get my ass working on.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 06:25

fuck this
fuck debug mode being so slow that it forced me to use RelWithDebInfo to debug
fuck optimized-out local variables
fuck stupid character buffer size limitations
thank god for std::string

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/15/2023 06:27

go take a break or something and I'll put a build out that logs exceptions to sentry in a few minutes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 06:27

oh, no, it's fixed
it was painful
but it's fixed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/15/2023 06:28

ah, well I'll do it for next time.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 06:28

Actually the exception wasn't even the issue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/15/2023 06:28

Just verifying the reporting works in a new mac/linux build now.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 06:28

there were like 3 separate issues
the exception was fucking stupid, because I spent too much time on it
and it was just something stupid
I had a `<` instead of `<=` in some spot
and it was going 1 index out of bounds
since it was `vector.at()`, it throws an exception for that
But no, no, no
the REAL problem was not in COMPILING the yuurand scripts
after that exception fix they COMPILED fine
....but *Assigning them to slots crashed*
because
of the stupid
fucking
`char *buffer = new char[0x401];`
Why the fuck any of this was using `new[]` instead of just fucking
`char buffer[0x401] = {0};`
I have no idea
there were 4 buffers there
I changed all of them to not use `new[]`
and after doing that, the error message changed
and fairly clearly told me 'yo, it's going over this array bound'
so I increased to `buffer[0x800]`, not big enough
`0x1000`, not big enough
kept going
and got a stack overflow from allocating too big a buffer
....so the fix was to rewrite that entire fucking function to use an `std::string` for its' buffer.
this has been hours of pain
but fucking thank fuck I'm done

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 06:53

For the record
Yuurand script recompile
lowered the quest file size by ~20MB
(~10MB over 2.53, ~20MB over 2.55 not recompiled)

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 11:32

Christ...
I'm so sorry for what I've done to you, but fantastic work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:34

Blame whoever designed zscript in the first place
it's all their fault

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:36

(replying to @ Russ "I'm so sorry for what I've do‚Ä¶"): Do let us know the ZASM linecount results
The fact that fucking 20MB of scripts got trimmed though, like, jesus
that's all in ZASM binary size

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 11:36

Are these fixes all in the nightly posted 3 hours ago?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:36

should be

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 11:36

Man... that is... impressive
Let's try this out before I gotta run to work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:37

but yeah like
the idea behind the array initializer thing is
If I'm doing one opcode that stores a string containing the entire bee movie script
that's a fucking huge single opcode
so, the initial worry is, "but what if people make lots of big opcodes?"
....but then you realize, without that
it would be doing like
4 opcodes
per character of that string
which is like a FUCKTON more total space taken
and that's both quest file and memory that are affected

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 11:38

... it still crashes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:38

Oh??

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 11:39

I should be able to just copy/paste all 5 exes into my nightly folder from a week ago, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:39

try the latest build I DM'd you, maybe it didn't get into connor's build
uhh, should?
can't think why that wouldn't work

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 11:41

Nope, still crashes in your build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:41

....oooookay

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 11:41

Not sure if it's only on outputing ZASM that it crashes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:41

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "https://cdn.discordapp.com/at‚Ä¶"): given that it worked for me

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 11:41

Gotta run to work so can't extensively test atm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:41

oh.... true
I didn't test allegro.log output did I

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:48

....yep, crashed on that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 11:51

it wrote out this right before crash:
` WRITEPODARRAY d2,{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312,313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,325,326,327,328,329,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,337,338,339,340,341,342,343,344,345,346,347,348,349,350,351,352,353,354,355,356,357,358,359,360,361,362,363,364,365,366,367,368,369,370,371,372,373,374,375,376,377}`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 12:00

.....oh
it's using fucking al_trace() to print it to allegro.log
which has a very tiny character limit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 12:02


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1066411149656068219/1075386574243639366/image.png?ex=65e85b4b&is=65d5e64b&hm=fcde12e1937ea17804f21650c4bf877f3f810ff860bed3391e952195f0e770c0&)
So, I used `safe_al_trace` for the metadata
....but didn't swap the call for the opcode lines.
(The safe function *is slower*, so, not without reason, but, clearly needed here)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 12:40

.....
So
so
I just got a full allegro.log output of Yuurand
.....it's bigger than the quest file.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1066411149656068219/1075396492828868618/image.png?ex=65e86487&is=65d5ef87&hm=a1afc5ed30f8f0f8b5e7778114bf16dec7841e128ac25491377cf96741616236&)
it's almost *double* the size of the quest file

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 12:49

oh, also, I cleaned up the `safe_al_trace` code, it should be a LOT faster now
required a local edit to our version of allegro though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 12:52

(Instead of breaking up a string into tiny chunks, and `al_trace()`'ing each chunk, now it just writes the full string DIRECTLY to the log file)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 13:04

https://www.mediafire.com/file/cds4yrk50jjuud5/zc.zip/file @ Russ here's the fix

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 13:07

Grazie. Will try it out when I can.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 14:17

....for the record, trying to compile in the latest 2.53 build gave me this:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1066411149656068219/1075420609934274600/image.png?ex=65e87afd&is=65d605fd&hm=a0f87b9d1f92409cddb4f09db3dc0844bcb1ff7b6105787f1e470b5b83e49112&)
sooo looks like I can't sate my curiosity in comparing the ZASM myself

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 15:37

lol
You‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs the latest build?
It compiles fine for me
We USED to have this problem
But the newest build fixed the memory leak

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 15:42

whatever the latest on the site was

=== @ Russ 02/15/2023 15:47

On the official ZC site? Cuz I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs actually the newest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2023 15:55

... Well that'd be a problem
It was clearly newer than what I had
