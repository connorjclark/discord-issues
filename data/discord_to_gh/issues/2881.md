See video. There's also a tile warp that lets you go to out of bounds screens but I'm pretty sure that's intended.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "how about in 2.53?"): Probably. I don't have it installed to check.

That infinite loop of peing trapped on row 8 can be escaped through entering a non-cave tile warp twice, seen in the video
