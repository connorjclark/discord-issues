The built in movement functions can clip enemies into solid objects under certain circumstances with the ``Sprite Coordinates are Floats`` quest rule, which makes collision checks a headache.

The two numbers in the top right corner tracks the enemy's position.

By having the angle be weird values at the top of the screen with this function I was able to clip it into solid objects:
``this->MoveAtAngle(angle, this->Step/100, SPW_NONE);``
The NPC has a step speed of 300

The following CanMove check always returns false regardless of what angle is input:
``this->CanMoveAtAngle(ang, 1, 0)``

Would this occur with normal ghost?
because, I literally copied ghost's code pretty much

I think what's happening is the collision check is counting subpixels. If the collision check clips into a solid object by subpixels it's still counted as collided. The movement functions can clip them into solid objects by subpixel amounts and then some weird shenanigans can clip them a full pixel into the object and cause issues that way

Because I'm also seeing a lot of instances where NPCs get stuck running along the edges of walls using walk functions.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "because, I literally copied g…"): Looking into Ghost's code, I can be certain it was not written to account for floating point sprite positions
