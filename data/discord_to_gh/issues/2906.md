Seen in hookshot 1. The top of "overworld" is getting cut off and I'm not sure if it's just been moved upwards or what

removing the conditional from

```
// if(replay_version_check(0,19))
  y2 = y1+8;
```

and the bug does not happen
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) or @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)   hope you can take over from here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 05:32

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I assigned this to you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 05:39

oh uhh

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1184538278968443000/1188355213866840114/image.png?ex=65e40d09&is=65d19809&hm=e17f59d42f43ed0db9d0e9893ff3e5ad07814b12916c7eac1a76b8897cc422c9&)
these are probably just backwards
hmm
either that or the `auto y2 = ` needs a `+1`
not sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 06:48

So uhh, there are also multiple other issues with dmap titles, including that with the `qr_OLD_DMAP_INTRO_STRINGS` compat rule DISABLED (so, the 'bugfixed' behavior) causes the `Show as one line` flag to entirely fail
which, were @ Moosh's changes
https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/6bd8a9acbe6fc6ad8cb90379e8d0a2ce028bec23

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 06:54

waitwait wtf is "Show as one line"? I don't even recall that setting existing. Obviously it should be hidden with new settings because there's no concept of a "line" any more to begin with. You make it fit in whatever space you want as with any other text box

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 06:55

ohhh, that's nice
then yeah that's just a gui error
(show as one line was my feature in the subscreen rewrite)

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 06:56

gotcha. I must've overlooked it because it was so new

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 06:56

also would check the initial report here that Deedee had and see if it's related to your changes
(I would check, but didn't replicate it when I tried, and no file to replicate with has been provided...)

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 06:57

I wouldn't think it was because it should be running all the same multi line drawing code as the existing text box types

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 06:59

or wait no, this is with the old behavior. So I'm even further confused by it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 06:59

err, wait, but connor bisected it to my commit
so nevermind
bleh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2024 06:59

Not following totally but I'm certain the commit i pointed out is where the regression started
annnnd we're on the same page now lol
I didn't have to do anything special to make the bug happen. Just loaded hookshot quest at dmap 0 0 and saw it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:00

@ Moosh toggling your rule does change the position of the second line
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I didn't have to do anything…"): link to quest?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2024 07:00

was fresh install
its on the database

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 07:01

https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&id=469

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:01

"its on the database" love that as an answer
see it's not named `Hookshot 1` on the database even
so wouldn't have had the right title

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2024 07:01

you should know the #1 quest ever made

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:01

I don't play quests
I don't know almost any
lol

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 07:01

Emily doesn't know my work 😦 I'm wounded

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:02

I know Yuurand, Stellar Seas, uhh

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 07:02

but nah, it's cool. always helps to link stuff

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:02

those are probably the two quests that would be most familiar on my mind to remember
so if it isn'y Yuurand or Stellar Seas, I give no guarantees that I'll know what is being talked about
(...and like, providing a link isn't that hard lol, and saves time)
(/ end rant)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2024 07:06

sure, i was just afk and the site wasnt loading on my phone 💀
thought it was another ddos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:09

ahh, bleh
Clearly the problem here was me attempting to be too clever
and accounting for the text font height
...there's a *replay version check* fixing this lmao
but aye, it looks wrong in that situation, because, I believe, I forgot to account for the *shadows*

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2024 07:10

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "removing the conditional from…"): ok, nowwww we're on the same page
🙃

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:11

...regardless, Moosh's new code, kinda does *even better* than what I was trying to do with that fix
so, err... probably fine to just remove that replay version check then
since moosh's code replaces the entire function anyway
(I'll do that now)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:13

also, toggling the qr in hookshot results in this
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1184538278968443000/1192002713072967690/image.png?ex=65e81789&is=65d5a289&hm=52a7c429cc78e67cd63e1378470066313c7f161d014390d44aa0fb5c8c9e0053&)
which, err, @ Moosh you should probably hide the `Alignment` dropdown as well? (Or are you using that somehow? It's definitely not being used in the way it traditionally is, given that the widget is so far to the right now)

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 07:15

Did you  toggle the qr in hookshot 1?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:15

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "also, toggling the qr in hook…"): ^
literally what I said lol

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 07:15

reading's hard okay 😛
but that's all you did?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:15

aye
Normally, alignment `Center` indicates that the `X` of the widget is the center of the widget
...your code does not do this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:17

...ah, looks like textboxes also don't do this

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 07:17

...oh.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:17

so that'd be why
textboxes use align differently

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 07:17

I think I prefer it this way tbh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:17

....I suppose that's fine here, it makes sense
yeah

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2024 07:17

Because I'd want the text to align in the center of the region where I've specified for it to appear

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:18

as long as it's consistent with textboxes there's no issue
so yeah
definitely should hide the `Show as one line`

cuz that just does not work
(when updating LGA3, it confused the shit out of me, and I had to enable the compat rule to fix my subscreen, lol)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:20

anyway, marking fixed
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1184538278968443000/1192004536424996905/image.png?ex=65e8193b&is=65d5a43b&hm=46929cb82a5d4367362f32d3d2f58ead9bdcdfe9189514c6414fed81b705e448&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 07:39

oh, and @ Moosh, maybe you could add a `Fix Tool` that removes extra spaces from all dmap titles in the quest? (trim all leading/trailing spaces, and reduce any multiple-spaces-in-a-row to single spaces)
would be useful for updatin
