Lantern item- passively drains cost. While in a dark room, the lamp will require it's cost be met to keep running, similarly to the Lens while active, draining every x frames based on the cost timer.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/28/2023 19:32

Good idea, it can also be used with a Note item that gives and takes away the Lantern item so that it can be used as an item to save fuel instead of always being used automatically.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/28/2023 19:33

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Good idea, it can also be use…"): ......yeah, I definitely thought of that, totally
(damn the note item is nice, for being such a simple addition)

=== @ Alucard648 03/02/2023 05:05

I think this request should expand to all passive items and similar things.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 05:05

uhh
well you need a good way to define what its' passively doing
what 'passive items' are missing costs
I mean, amulet I suppose, but you can have a lens show invis enemies to basically be a with-cost amulet

Good old Rings that reduce damage - MP cost charged per hit taken, like Twilight Princess Magic Armor.
Stomp Boots -  MP cost charged per stomp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 05:10

1. Exists
2. exists
(1. isn't new for sure, 2. I don't think is, but might be- deedee fancied up some stomp boots stuff)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 05:13

raft/flippers I suppose exist
or ladder
but those are all a bit silly
hover boots?

=== @ Alucard648 03/02/2023 05:14

Bracelets -  MP cost charged per push
Flippers -  MP cost charged while swimming
Counter regenerating items (Magic quiver, bomb bag, wallet, heart ring) -  MP cost charged until either run out of MP or counter is full.
Hover Boots -  MP cost charged per use
Magic Key -  MP cost charged per door unlock

=== @ Alucard648 03/02/2023 05:16

Ladder -  MP cost charged each time ladder is placed.
Book -  MP cost charged each time magic Lweapon hits solid combo to produce fire.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 05:17

pretty sure book already does
though it charges when the magic is fired
because, the book can change the damage of the magic projectile and such too- it doesn't just make fire
the others, make sense enough. Not all will be that easy, though.
(None of this is near the current priority, either; I put down the lamp idea so it wouldn't be forgotten)
oh, and attack rings don't charge cost
nor do whimsy rings which they were based on
Moon pearl?
that.... could be interesting, like a timer for how long you can stay in a "dark world" dmap
would need to charge passively while preventing the dmap's influence, using cost timer
...I completely forgot the `Refiller` was a thing
though that obviously charges cost, kinda the point
peril ring DOES charge magic already

=== @ Alucard648 03/02/2023 05:22

Raft -  MP cost charged each time, you set sail off dock.
Tiger Scrolls -  MP cost charged per execution of technique.
Shields -  MP cost charged per eweapon blocked.
Whimsical Rings -  MP cost charged each time critical hit triggers.

That`s all for 2.53 items. 2.55 passive items can handle costs in scripts.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 05:23

so
ALREADY EXIST, these aren't even new!
~~Good old Rings that reduce damage - MP cost charged per hit taken, like Twilight Princess Magic Armor.~~

Bracelets -  cost charged per push
Flippers -  cost charged over time while swimming
Counter regenerating items (Magic quiver, bomb bag, wallet, heart ring) -   cost charged each refill
Hover Boots -  cost charged per use? (Feel like this should be over time while hovering)
Magic Key -  cost charged per door unlock
Ladder - cost charged each time ladder is placed.
Raft - cost charged each time, you set sail off dock.
Whimsical Rings - cost charged each time critical hit triggers.
Attack rings- each time it increases damage
~~Lamp - Over time in dark rooms~~
Stone of Agony - Cost over time while showing a secret
Wealth Medal, each time you purchase
Amulet, over time while revealing enemies
so about half of those exist already

=== @ Alucard648 03/02/2023 05:27

Stone of Agony - MP Cost charged vis timer, while vibration process is running.

=== @ Alucard648 03/02/2023 05:29

And thanks for putting in Wealth Medal - forgot this one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 05:30

I actually looked through every itemclass one by one
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 03/02/2023 17:50

actually i do have a quibble with the tiger scrolls, let me make a thread

=== @ P-Tux7 03/02/2023 17:59

My thoughts on the unimplimented ones

Bracelet and Ladder - Bleagh, because it's easy to use them by accident.

Whimsical Rings, Attack Rings, Wealth Medal, Amulet, all counter-regenerating items - This is ok but probably works better with a Note item that allows you to turn them on and off.

Hover Boots - I feel as though this would be a good toggle. I need to check if there's a flag that determines whether you can end the hover early or not. In cases where you cannot, especially when Hover Boots are used as a makeshift ladder/flippers, I think the single cost would be a better option for those quests.

Amulet - if anyone actually cares (I don't) then Deedee would have to look at this for Ganon, because he's not revealed in the same way that invisible enemies are with an Amulet-class item, but rather by possessing an item of arbitrary ID#.

> need to check if there's a flag that determines whether you can end the hover early or not
You can

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2023 12:24

(meta) thread name was changed: New Item Costs
Added the lamp cost
(It will only charge if a non-zero timer value is given, and will charge every timer number of frames while in dark rooms)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/16/2023 15:11

😊

=== @ Alucard648 03/20/2023 14:48

Wisp Rings: L1 - Cost charged on preventing permanent Jinx, L2 - Cost charged on preventing Any jinx status effect.
