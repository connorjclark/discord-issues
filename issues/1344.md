The Whistle Recorder Ocarina Whirlwind tornado sound effect keeps repeating again, just like it used to do last time after link has been transferred to a location, it it does not turn off unless you leave a screen.
It's supposed to play Whirl wind sound effect after you blow whistle and then after you are warped, it is supposed to turn off after link is transfered.
I am using latest alpha release you just released.
