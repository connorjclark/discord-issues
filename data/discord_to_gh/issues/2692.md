In this position, the player cannot move up- but only when their subpixel position is off. (The ffcs have no subpixel values themselves, though this should need to handle that case as well....)

So, the "push" when hitting a solid needs to run some sort of subpixel check to prevent it from overshooting - because, the right ffc corner-pushes you left, just far enough that you hit the left ffc, corner-pushing you back right.

Didn't you fix this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 07:53

...I did, but there were more issues with it that @ Moosh was looking into? unsure if that was finished

=== @ Moosh 10/28/2023 07:56

There were more issues? This is news to me I'm pretty sure?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 07:56

this thread was before you did anything

Right and I'm pretty sure it's fixed. Was waiting to hear back from users but I'll take the general silence as a yes. Also I seem to have lost that other bug topic where I fixed the fix...?
