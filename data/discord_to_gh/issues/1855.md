Like how the flute works in a link to the past.

Also if feasible, specify a delay attribute in frames before the game responds to the whistle's usage. Nothing happens if the player leaves the screen (the timer resets and stops counting)

Is the whistle even tied to the duration of the SFX that's played?

I know Mitsukara's Panoply of Calatia's whistle had no delay  on its whistle and it was amazing.  Been a while though.
Probably scripted.  Or it had no actual SFX but was scripted to play the longer default SFX in the background to the item.

I believe it is tied to the length of the sfx, in engine

=== @ Russ 09/12/2022 10:29

Yeah. The easiest way around this is to tie it to an blank sfx and have a simple script play the real sfx you want.

i *am* working on a "whistle" script
to where it doesn't freeze the screen but the whistle effect only starts after the animation and music ends

=== @ Attempt 09/13/2022 05:23

*also you could just script the engine whistle to play a sfx without using the engine sfx option*
that way the screen doesn't freeze

i mean making it a flag seems pretty sensible
lttp already does this with its bird call
