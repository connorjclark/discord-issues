Something like this. The ability for me make special markers for screens like in the pic. I know you can do this by changing level pallettes. But what if you don't want the screen to have a different pallette.

FWIW changing the palette doesn't do anything in actual ZC

But it does change the palette in zquest

True. I guess you could hack it by making duplicate palettes. Which would have different colours on the minimap I think.
