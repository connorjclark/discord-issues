The non-8-bit recolor tool is completely broken as of the newest alpha. Using it converts the entire image into color 0.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 01:49

w-w-w-whaaaaa

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 01:50

Moosh brought up an idea regarding this and the other tile editor bug that's stupid enough to probably be the reason
[8:46 PM] Moosh: I think what's happened is anything involving bitmaps in the editor is broken, because of that speed fix with drawing directly to the screen.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 01:53

. . . no
because that fix was in ZC
not ZQ

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 01:53

Huh...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 01:53

ZQ already had the intermediate bitmap, since 2.50.2 at least
I copied it *from* ZQ

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 01:53

Well whatever the issue, it wasn't there in November, and it's here now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 01:53

quite a few changes in that period

(replying to @ Russ "The non-8-bit recolor tool is‚Ä¶"): uhhh

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 02:12

Sorry, I mean when grabbing tiles
And pressing R
Only now occurring to me that we have two different functions with the same name in the tile editor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:13

oh

=== @ Moosh 02/17/2022 02:13

Grab recolor tool appears to be working for me as well
both 4-bit and 8-bit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:14

I frankly never knew how to use the grab tools
other than 8-bit recolor to rip stuff
never fucked with anything else
but uh, it definitely doesn't look like I get color 0

=== @ Moosh 02/17/2022 02:15

Is it maybe a specific image format that broke?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:15

@ Russ ?

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 02:16

Let's see
Isn't working with pngs or gifs
Is it possible it's only in small mode. Ugh, lemme test
No, same deal in large mode

=== @ Moosh 02/17/2022 02:18

Oh

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 02:18

... this has reminded me how much I dislike large mode but that is beside the point

=== @ Moosh 02/17/2022 02:18

I'm seeing the issue but only in certain csets

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 02:18

Oh!

=== @ Moosh 02/17/2022 02:18

2 and 9 specifically

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 02:18

It's in 2-4 and 9 for me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:19

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 02:19

Those particular numbers feel uh... unlikely to be coincidence

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:19

sounds level palette update related
same as #1393

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/17/2022 02:20

uhhhhh
I'll check in a bit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/17/2022 12:58

I'm seeing something that might potentially be wrong, but I'm confused as to why it didn't break before

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/17/2022 13:11

oh
I'm really hoping that I'm just misunderstanding the code and that the people before me weren't huge idiots

Okay so the problem was that the old devs hardcoded something really stupid that I didn't catch when I updated the palette to have new stuff
So the main palette was sized 15 and level palettes sized 13 before
but this is all stored in one big array and there's no difference

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/17/2022 13:26

The old devs didn't offset by the main palette to access the level palettes; they just added 1 to the level palette you were accessing (adding another 13), then added 2 to every level specific cset
obviously this kinda breaks when you bump up level palettes from 13 to 17

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 13:27

pffffffffffffffffffft
what the fuck

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/17/2022 14:44

(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìRecolor tool is broken.

=== @ Russ 02/18/2022 00:01

This... sounds about what I'd expect
