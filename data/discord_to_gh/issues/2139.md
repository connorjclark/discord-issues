I haven't tested this so I'm not sure this is a proper issue, but someone DM'd me telling me that the blaino statues in my old quest, Panoply of Calatia, do not work in 2.55. What these statues did, if I remember right, was the FFC script checked if you were pushing the button to use a certain item within an X and Y range of the FFC, and then set that FFC's vx/vy speed so that they would move in a straight line based on where the player punched them. According to the person reporting this they do not move. Deedee may know which statues these are and be able to find them more easily- they were located in Death Mountain sideview areas and the final dungeon, which I want to say was on map 19 or so. 

My apologies if this is a non-issue, and if you need me to test or open up ZC to try to figure this out better before counting it, I'll understand. But I thought it might have larger implications for something that changed with the recent-ish enhancements to FFC movements and stuff.

Mostly this is aimed at @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) since her familiarity with the quest would make this easier to test / resolve, if she's up for that.

Can you confirm details about the proper dmap and screen
