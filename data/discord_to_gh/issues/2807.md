@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) in the screen palette menu (default hotkey F4), a feature was requested and added a while back that allowed previewing the palette of the screen as you changed the dropdown in the dialog. Except, your recent render stuff is a bit fucky with this, because now the background RTI containing the screen is not redrawing when the palette updates- trying to debug something else right now, so, will leave this for you to fix. Should just need to mark the appropriate rti as dirty every time it changes the palette in this one dialog.

err, or mark the bitmap dirty when `refresh()` draws to it?
as this dialog uses `refresh()` when it changes the palette, so that would work fine too

Fixed locally.

Screen bitmap is frozen when a dialog is open. I added an override (like for the pause tint) to disable for this dialog.
