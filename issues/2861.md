basically whenever you go to edit a palette, the cursor will default to being inside the palette name box (the thing screenshotted).  this, however, drives me up a wall when I want to copy/paste a cset and accidentally add c to my palette name. I would prefer if the cursor automatically was actually in the cset section.
