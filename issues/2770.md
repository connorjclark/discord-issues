`HeroClass::startwpn`

I can maybe fix this but I need a test mode replay/qst file. couldn't reproduce it locally.

...hahaha, multiple reasons I didn't catch this initially
- If the same button is the sword and the throw button, the issue does not occur.
- I usually keep my SFX off most of the time, so, didn't catch when initially implementing the feature. (May not have caught anyway due to a-button sword...)
reproduced

...`can_attack()` was missing a check for this, and still returned `true`.
ez fix
