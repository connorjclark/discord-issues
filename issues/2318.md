I've noticed that in newer versions when you save it now saves the shortcut tabs to other screens in zQuest. If you go and grab tiles from another quest, it appears to reset them. It could be possible it's also setting them to the screen shortcut tabs the quest file being grabbed from.
I recall a similar bug in the past, where opening a quest to grab tiles from loads data and needs to not override the current quest data.

Yes the same happens for me, grab tiles from a quest > you lose your saved screen tabs + saved combo pane pages (what page the combo pane was at)

fucks sake

It's the same as when doing this saved over some Init stuff, like changed Item Class names. Probably the same kind of fix too.

No but close, it was resetting the ones that were "missing" and "needing to be reset to default" in the grabbed quest, because I forgot to check for `bool keepdata` first
