A simple item class that's meant for bush and grass dropsets a la LTTP so that you can randomly have enemies drop from these combos.

This class instantly spawns an NPC and kills itself off; it cannot be physically collected via touch or weapon, and giving it to the player via SCC or script does nothing without scripts except for SCCs that check to see if you own it, as with all items.

Attributes:
-Enemy ID(s?)
-Spawn Type (instant, puff, Armos/Ghini [Blink])
