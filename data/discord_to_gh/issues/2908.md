k been working on loop stuff... wanna talk, gonna thread it.
So, `loop` as a new keyword, is built for better-optimized looping. It has a few use cases:
- `loop(){}` == `while(true){}`, a simple infinite loop.
- `loop(int i : 0=..10)` -> `for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)`
- `loop(int i : 0=..100, 5)` -> `for(int i = 0; i < 100; i += 5)`

So, to break it down:
- An empty loop is a simple infinite loop
- Otherwise, a loop takes a Range statement (`0=..10`, `[0,10)`, or any other range expression- these ranges do NOT need to be compile-time constant.)
- Giving the variable a type is optional; it will default to `const int` (ex. `loop(i in 0=..10)`)
- The type of the variable being `const` allows some additional optimizations to be made, but prevents user modification of the variable within the loop.
- Naming the variable is optional; it will function without a name, using a default internal name of `__LOOP_ITER`. If the name is omitted, the type must also be omitted, as is the `:`/`in` token (ex. `loop(0=..10)`)
- Optionally, an incrementor can be supplied after a comma (ex. `loop(0=..10, 2)` to hit evens) - if no incrementor is supplied, it defaults to `1`.
  - If a negative incrementor is supplied, the loop will begin at the end, and count down to the beginning.

The `@NoOverflow()` annotation allows the loop to have a "last iteration" where it runs with the most extreme value in the range, if it has not already run with that value yet. Here, note that despite increasing by 4 each time, once the value reaches `16` which is out-of-range, it backsteps to the last value in the range, which since it's in `("int")` mode, is `15` (`"long"` or `"float"` mode, would give `15.9999` instead)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 19:23

Is i mutable, and if so does your no overflow thing work for that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 19:35

Edge case: range with no values and no overflow. What happens?

The name "no overflow" is not intuitive to me - have you considered other names?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 19:36

I feel the no overflow thing isn't a useful enough construct for the complexity it'd add, can't think of when I ever needed such a thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 20:45

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Is i mutable, and if so does…"): - If the type of the variable is constant, it is immutable. It is `const int` if no type is specified. If a non-constant type is specified, it works similarly to python's `range()`- any modifications to it are simply overwritten for the next iteration of the loop.
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Edge case: range with no valu…"): - "Range with no values" is not possible
or, hmm
with variables it might be
...hmm, good point, will double-test that shortly.
...and, err, hmm, `(0,0.0001)` is an edgecase there too
didn't used to be until it could be exclusive

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 20:48

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Edge case: range with no valu…"): other name ideas are welcome
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I feel the no overflow thing…"): it doesn't add much complexity, surprisingly, and is useful in a particular situation Moosh noted comes up a lot (the whole reason for the idea)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 20:50

AlwaysRunEndpoint
IncludeEndpoint
ForceIncludeEndpoint
If the end point is exclusive does it run it?
Or is it compiler error

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 20:55

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "If the end point is exclusive…"): so, you have to specify a mode
`int`, or `long`/`float`
`long/float` is the basic behavior, which, for an exclusive endpoint, would give you `-0.0001` from the endpoint (the nearest value that is inside the range)
`int` mode does the same thing as `long/float` mode, but then it calls `Truncate()` on the value
and it has a check to prevent duplicate running, so if the new value produced after these steps is equal to the previous value that ran, it just terminates rather than running a duplicate iteration
which, if all the parameters of the loop are constant, took I believe single-digit opcodes
which only run once or twice each
I like `AlwaysRunEndpoint`, will change it to that
oh, and also, if the increment is negative, the loop starts at the end, and works down to the start
with all the same rules, and the endpoint thing applying to the start point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 21:01

so ```cpp
@AlwaysRunEndpoint("int")
loop(q : [0,16), 4)
    Trace(q);
@AlwaysRunEndpoint("long")
loop(q : [0,16), 4)
    Trace(q);
@AlwaysRunEndpoint("long")
loop(q : (0,16], -4)
    Trace(q);```
would produce these 3 outputs
A useful instance in particular from the engine code that sticks out to me for this is hitbox check stuff
a lot of stuff checks like every 8 pixels of a hitbox
so like, for a 16x16
it hits 0, 8
then the loop terminates
then a separate check outside the loop checks 15.9999
just being able to include that last range value makes the code able to be a lot cleaner

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 21:13

Can the step value be part of the range expression
(0, x, 1) or (0, x: 1)
Some languages do like that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 21:14

not easily, and that then crosses toes with the switch/case use for ranges

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 21:14

I think ruby?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 21:14

also doesn't fit well with using the `[`/`(` to denote inclusive/exclusive

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 21:14

Maybe scala

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 21:14

unless you put the incr as the *middle* value maybe
regardless, feels weird

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 21:14

Ah ok, nvm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 21:15

just adding it with a comma like a param seems sane enough
could have done a semi like a for loop...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 21:21

though, a semi in a for is followed then by an incrementing *expression*, not just an increment number
denoting it more as a parameter of a loop function seems more logically consistent
...I really need to allow comma-delimited expression lists for for loops...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 21:23

Yes, I agree comma makes more sense here than semicolon for that reason
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...I really need to allow com…"): Huh, why?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 21:24

it works in c++

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 21:24

Oh like within each ; boundrary

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 21:25

Have a multiple expression thing
Gotcha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 21:25

yeah, exactly
for the first boundary should be dead easy, just use a decllist instead of a decl, we already have that
second doesn't need it, you use `&&` and `||` for that there
third then just needs a comma-delimited expression list nonterminal added for it to use
and needs to store a vector of exprs instead of a single expr, and blah blah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 21:43

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> so, also, I need to update the expected zasm, because I shifted the damn labels which are present in the comments... that's kinda annoying af
so, changing that from using the first relevant label as the ID number to display in the comment, to using a separate unique identifier that should update less often

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2023 22:32

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "for the first boundary should…"): err, this already works, because it takes any single statement, and the comma-delimited list of declarations is an `ASTDataDeclList` statement
so only the third section needs changing lol

we good
had slight trouble, because can only pass around `AST` objects in the bison
so I made a new node:```cpp
template<class NodeType>
class ASTNodeList : public AST
{
public:
    ASTNodeList(LocationData const& location = LOC_NONE) : data() {}
    ASTNodeList* clone() const {return new ASTNodeList(*this);}
    
    void execute(ASTVisitor& visitor, void* param = NULL){}
    
    owning_vector<NodeType> data;
    
    void push(NodeType* node) {data.push_back(node);}
    owning_vector<NodeType>&& take() {return std::move(data);}
};
```
just acts as a temporary data holder for a vector of any type I want, and I can steal the data from it into an `owning_vector` anywhere else

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2023 01:19

there IS a slight problem

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1185193049475793006/1185390714100666418/image.png?ex=65ebb921&is=65d94421&hm=467d63ae279548f207aeff97a1147f9af83c1189b19583ddcec376f405cced37&)
trying to do a declaration list of multiple declarations, fails due to ambiguous syntax
....why the fuck you would be *DECLARING* things in the *INCREMENTOR* section, I don't know
(it results in the variable having value 0 on the first iteration, and running the initializer after the first iteration...)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2023 01:21

so, that's weird shit anyway, and I don't mind breaking it. Also you can work around it if you really care, as while `; int z = 2, z2 = 4` fails, `; int z = 2, int z2 = 4` works fine still
because there's no question when you find the type `int` of what you're encountering
...but yeah, really obscure edgecase that is definitely ignorable for the greater feature
