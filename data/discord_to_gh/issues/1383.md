Please. PLEASE. I'm begging you. These buttons are next to useless in sets with lots of palettes, and I just lost 15 minutes of work accidentally hitting 0, then slipping and clicking paste screen instead of paste palette to fix it. It's the single biggest time waster in the program. I'm begging you, please, add an option to disable these god forsaken buttons.

That is a BIG oof
should be dead-simple

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 16:39

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) how should I be adding options to the options enum?
Should I put new ones right before the last one, or can I stuff one in the middle?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 16:39

shouldn't make any difference
but don't try touching this
considering I've just added it

=== @ Russ 02/13/2022 16:39

... that was fast

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 16:40

....only added the checkbox to zcl though, need to add it to the zq options menu
I mean

I guess I'm just used to the old way of doing things
Which is to say

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 16:40

it's literally `if(!DisableLPalShortcuts)`

=== @ Russ 02/13/2022 16:40

I've argued with Zoria about this like 3 separate times
And each time failed to convince him it would be worthwhile
Devs listening to the userbase is still a new and strange thing
:P

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 16:42

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "but don't try touching this"): fuck off I wanted to do the cool thing üò≠

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 16:42

I already had pushed by the time you were asking questions
lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 16:43

(replying to @ Russ "And each time failed to convi‚Ä¶"): wow really? what a shock

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 16:44

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíDisable 0-9 switching palettes

#deleted-channel @ Russ

=== @ Russ 02/13/2022 16:51

Okay so
It works great... except 0 still switches the palette
And 0 is the one I hit by far the most trying to reach for F11

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 16:51

oh fek

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 16:52

brb stealing emily's thunder

=== @ Russ 02/13/2022 16:52

lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 16:52

....I was about to say `thought I tested pretty thoroughly`
but it occurs to me
that if I'm on palette 0
I wouldn't notice the 0 key changing it

=== @ Russ 02/13/2022 16:52

lol
I figured it was something like that

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 16:54

Fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 16:54

the magical `nothing to see here`
