Do you reckon this is a related issue? Or should I create another ticket?

that's #2329

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 14:07

Ah indeed it is related!
Except for me it fixes the issue when you uncheck "Lock aspect ratio"

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 14:08

So on mac it's conveniently the other way around it seems

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 14:20

....what the fuck??

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 14:37

Hahaha
Maybe you should just discontinue the mac build üòÇ
Virtual machine ftw

wtffff, resizing ZLaunch worked for a moment and when trying again it stopped working and crashes
I'll delete the config

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 14:53

Nah I can't get it to work again. But I swear it was working at first
I also just now tried with resizing ZQuest. It worked at first, second try it fucks up

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 14:57

Yea sorry Emily, can't provide more useful information than that I think. I tried all the options related to resizing as well and none seem to make a difference. It just crashes now.
Seems that my device registers something once and after that it refuses ZC to be resized or something and just crashes it

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) mac issues

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 14:58

Does Connor always work on mac?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 14:58

he's the only one of us who can

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 14:59

Alrighty üëç 
Tnx so far though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/21/2023 14:59

Can you check if alpha 112 is fine

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 14:59

Sure, 1 moment

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 15:02

It works better there, but not ideal, I'll record a video

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/21/2023 16:44

Can you also look at the other things you mentioned in 112

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/21/2023 17:08

Sure, but only on Sunday or Monday if you do not mind
Now no access to ZC
