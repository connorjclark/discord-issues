"Weapon Dir" can only make a spawned weapon move, there's no option for standing still, like you might want a bomb explosion to do. So please make it so that 0 makes it stand still and 1-8 are the other directions, and 9+ is random direction. Basically shift all the current numbers up by one.

no, that won't work
because the dir numbers are the dir numbers, same exact numbers used everywhere relating to direction
Nothing is actually wrong with the dir
the problem is that there's no place to specify the *Speed*
being able to specify a speed is a major thing missing anyway, and a speed of 0 gives you the effect you are missing
Also, even a weapon that does not move, has a dir
so, speed as an attrishort or attribute, is what needs to be added
(meta) thread name was changed: Step Effects missing Weapon Speed attribute
