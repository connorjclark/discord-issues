A new movement style for the Bug Net.  Used as a flag.

-The net completes a full 9-frame animation through the 8 directions, starting at one point beside Link and ending at that same point. The animation is clockwise no matter which direction Link faces.

-Where each net starts per-Link facing direction:
Up: To his left
Right: To his north
Down: To his right
Left: To his south
This means that the net always starts on Link's left-hand side.
Sorry for the delay in testing out the bug net, but I didn't think to compare the animation to Z3 until now that I'm documenting all that frame data.

This will probably wait a bit, because.... frankly handling that many frames sounds suuuper painful
(melee weapons need to have each individual frame hard-coded)
