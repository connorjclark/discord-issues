I'm not sure if this is actually a bug or not. It feels a bit like unintended behaviour though since one of the major use cases for this is push block mirrors.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:19

Technically the problem is everything to do with the beam is gridlocked logic
....but yeah, it would make sense to somehow account for it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/26/2023 09:19

you might be ableto look at ffcs for how I handled it there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:19

wait, did you handle the beam for ffcs?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/26/2023 09:19

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:20

oh
neato

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/26/2023 09:20

IIRC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:20

can you just do the same for pushblocks then

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/26/2023 09:20

er, maybe not solid ffcs
actually, question @ Lunaria : there's a new QR related to pushblocks

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:21

oh?
what is it called?

any of these ones?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/26/2023 09:22

Fake-solid push blocks; make sure it's disabled

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:22

will give it a try

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/26/2023 09:22

beams should hopefully be blocked then?

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:23

nope

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1144923821892173874/1144925052471623800/zc_screen00014.png?ex=65ec2a8c&is=65d9b58c&hm=9e64a600a4554917bb2a2b0f7c6123a7e4a3e39b2a096d3bbe52cc58d9f2aafa&)

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:24

still passes through the moving pushblock

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/26/2023 09:28

damnit
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Technically the problem is ev…"): so then yeah you need to figure out the gridlock logic
no clue how you want to handle that

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:36

unrelated

are light blocks meant to keep being triggered even when the light beam is removed? (the upper block here looks like it's still triggered?)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:37

Light triggers will remain triggered once the puzzle has been "Solved"
IIRC

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:37

but don't all triggers need to be hit for that first?
the bottom one has not been hit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:37

yeah
so uh, do you have it set up properly

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:38

I dunno, maybe I'm missing something

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1144923821892173874/1144928839156379679/image.png?ex=65ec2e13&is=65d9b913&hm=d5199af6e9a0d3c1dfab768bb86c69f3555f63a54da8a45fa8a1d0ee52ee79d0&)
I assumed I just needed the combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:38

what combo the `Next` combo is is important

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:38

oh
the tooltip should probably mention that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:39

tooltip for the first flag checkbox:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1144923821892173874/1144929092077109299/image.png?ex=65ec2e4f&is=65d9b94f&hm=37aa638ce97d053eaf08ea2410c26faa37dfecd6251a041fc4579f17384770d3&)

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:39

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:39

so, the next combo needs to be set to properly revert

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:40

so need two combos with the lighttrigger combo type in a row?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:40

yes
an "unlit" and a "lit"

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:41

Right, I think I can config that. The main combo tooltip should probably mention it tho.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/26/2023 09:42

probably
fuck if I'm attempting words right now though lmao

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/26/2023 09:42

is cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2023 01:32

so

that's a moving solid ffc

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2023 01:38

and @ Lunaria
The one on the left here is a pushblock

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2023 01:42

so, should be fixed
there's a compat qr

=== @ Mani Kanina 09/11/2023 04:52

niiiice
