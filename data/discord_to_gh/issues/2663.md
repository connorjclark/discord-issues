current nightly, but it looks like every alternating block you push in a column of push blocks isn't updating or checking for pitfall combos properly  

included three crests example because i think its funny - although my guess is you can walk through it because of the scripts i'm using

also not sure if this is a factor but the blocks are on a separate layer to the pits?

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) think you did the pushblock/pit stuff, right?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/18/2023 21:10

nah, that was you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2023 21:17

Well shit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2023 21:19

....OHHHHH
I see what's happening
(replying to @ tacochopper "current nightly, but it looks…"): thank you for the three crests inclusion, because seeing it in the classic tileset with the swords for falling sprites my brain just didn't click as to what the problem was
...oh, I only see PART of the problem apparently

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2023 21:22

...wait, nevermind
wtf
I see a problem that makes sense to be the cause
but like, there's checks already in place to prevent that from being the cause
fuck
back to no ideas

=== @ tacochopper 09/19/2023 05:12

Would it be to do with the first block updating while you push the second one? Or is that irrelevant
That's the only thing I can think of, because it doesn't matter about what order you push the blocks in

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 05:12

(replying to @ tacochopper "Would it be to do with the fi…"): that's my thought but there's checks to prevent that

=== @ tacochopper 09/19/2023 05:13

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "thank you for the three crest…"): Default falling sprites be like "swords"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 05:14

yeah lol
sprite 0 be like "swords"
. . .
oh for fucks

=== @ tacochopper 09/19/2023 05:15

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "that's my thought but there's…"): Yeah that's absolutely baffling. The weird thing too is sometimes the

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 05:15

ok, so you know how I said there were 2 bugs?

=== @ tacochopper 09/19/2023 05:15

Oh wait
She found it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 05:15

One of them was with your test quest

=== @ tacochopper 09/19/2023 05:15

looooool what happened

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 05:15

these were your blocks on layer 2, right?

=== @ tacochopper 09/19/2023 05:15

Correct yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 05:15

...notice what happens when I hide layer 2.

....you had some of them on the wrong layer
which means they were not on the same layer as the push flag

=== @ tacochopper 09/19/2023 05:16

nah that was intentional
unless I had the push flag set up on them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 05:16

well that's why every other one wasn't pushing
because the push flag was not on layer 0 for those
so you were pushing the invisible combo on the layer above them instead\

=== @ tacochopper 09/19/2023 05:17

Yeahhhh the initial test was having everything on layer 2, I just set non pushable blocks on 0 by default so I can do pretty screen design underneath them lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 05:17

so, yeah, the entire oddity with push collision was just your test quest being set wrong
....and the other issue was fixed by adding an additional sanity check
whch
makes no sense to me
because there's ALREADY A FUCKING CHECK THERE
that should be doing the same fucking thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 05:21

...now time to see if nuking the old sanity check and just using my better new one works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 05:43

the answer is yes

=== @ tacochopper 09/19/2023 10:41

lol
amazing
