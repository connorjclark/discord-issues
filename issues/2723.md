Enter doesn't do anything on this menu. It should at least hit "Check" (imo should hit check and close the dialog)

(replying to @ mitchfork "http://puu.sh/JRNN0/bd2885a1e‚Ä¶"): The problem here, for the record, is that, you know how you can use `TAB` to select different buttons, and then press `ENTER` to click the currently highlighted button?
If we give `ENTER` a purpose like you are suggesting, that ***completely breaks*** the tab navigation feature in that dialog, which could be an accessibility issue.
In fact, I'm pretty sure enter USED to do this when I first created this dialog, and it was reverted because people complained about it

didn't enter just close the dialogue andpeople complained that it didn't  do what mitch wanted?

I think at one point that happened yeah
thought it was an issue *either* way though

=== @ mitchfork 10/30/2023 14:33

imo OK should be highlighted by default and it should always check/apply the cheat password level regardless if you click it or press enter

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2023 15:33

I agree with that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/30/2023 15:36

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è do whatever then, I honestly don't care
I know I've changed this multiple times and people keep asking it to be changed again
so

The request is Enter = check, not OK. Sounds like it never did Check.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/30/2023 20:02

I feel like it did check originally

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/30/2023 20:02

(replying to @ mitchfork "imo OK should be highlighted‚Ä¶"): Yeah that sounds better

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/30/2023 20:05

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I feel like it did check orig‚Ä¶"): ...or maybe I just suggested making it check when this came up originally?
either way I know multiple things were suggested that conflicted for this, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
