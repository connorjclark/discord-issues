When "Newer Player Movement" is on and Link is inside a solid wall flush with the left edge of the screen with a step speed <100, he will be pushed out of the wall when attempting to scroll left. This doesn't appear to occur on other scroll directions or when in a solid not on the screen edge. If the wall extends all the way to the right, it will scroll to the right instead.

(replying to @ Moosh "When "Newer Player Movement"…"): what about upwards (with large player hitbox on)?

=== @ Moosh 01/15/2024 00:53

Oh! Good idea
Up with large hitbox has the same behavior. Good catch

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/15/2024 00:55

so, it's a rounding direction / truncation type thing

=== @ Moosh 01/15/2024 00:55

That's what I was thinking. But it pushes Link fully out of the wall. Which is odd

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/15/2024 00:56

I'm guessing that's part of the scrolling
when you scroll, it just *sets* your x/y to a specific value
not sure tho
...hmm, no, because if it were there, how would it be getting confused?
