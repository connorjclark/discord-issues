A 103 seemed to break the code that was used to set controller abilities.  It outright crashes using ZC Launcher to ZC player and while it works on the Test Mode, it is very slow.  Using an XBox One Controller to test

*crashes*?
For FUCKS SAKE
why can't anything fucking work

=== @ NightmareJames 02/17/2022 02:17

Yes, basically just click it and it hangs there infinitely and you can't get out of it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:17

I don't have any form of controller to test with
Also
james
hanging and crashing
are *entirely different*

=== @ NightmareJames 02/17/2022 02:17

Edit the title if you want, but it just stays there infinitely
Either way, it disables ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:18

no buttons do anything?
either controller or keyboard?

=== @ NightmareJames 02/17/2022 02:18

Yes ma'am
And I have to force close it in task manager

try this just to be sure
(I didn't do anything just now, but, just would be good to see if I already somehow fixed it, because I did change stuff around there)

@ DeletedUser

=== @ NightmareJames 02/17/2022 02:24

That one works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:25

oh
I'm surprised it wasn't accepting input
the keyboard dialog had the same issue
except, it just, wasn't drawing the prompt visually
and you could just press a key
and it worked

=== @ NightmareJames 02/17/2022 02:25

Hrmmmmmmmmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:25

curious that the controller one would be different

=== @ NightmareJames 02/17/2022 02:28

It could be invisible too, causing to act like a hang and lock out all inputs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:29

it shouldn't lock out inputs

=== @ NightmareJames 02/17/2022 02:29

What should I do for a test case?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:31

I mean, if it's fixed in the build I posted it shouldn't matter

=== @ NightmareJames 02/17/2022 02:32

OK, fair
I'll get to ZX testing after sets tomorrow then
TY
