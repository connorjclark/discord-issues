Mostly asking under the assumption it'd be like a two minute job, but yeah it just seems odd not being able to. Ideally to a ZC/questnameMIDIs/ subfolder if possible.

I second this

This won't be a usable method for most, but I have a CLI tool that does this.

https://github.com/connorjclark/zquest-data

Pass  `--save-midis` as a flag
If it'd be useful I could (later this week)  run a script that extracts _all_ the midis on purezc and  upload  them somewhere üòõ

Well I got as far as installing docker but as usual computers are so wonderful and intuitive.

=== @ Majora 04/22/2022 23:24

oh I think I got it
after installing docker I had to do "docker build https://github.com/connorjclark/zquest-data.git " and now its goin'

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/22/2022 23:25

Iirc you'll need to make a folder called quests too and put your quest in there
(or you can run that download quests script, which takes a bit and scrapes purezc)

=== @ Majora 04/22/2022 23:26

gotcha, ty. nah I just wanna yank the MIDIs out of my own/one quest

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/22/2022 23:27

wtf I did this 3 years ago? Seemed more recent

=== @ Majora 04/23/2022 00:02

I get "invalid reference format" which assumedly is because you build on Mac and I'm on Windows.
after doing docker run ./docker_run.sh "test_data/bs/2.5/NewBS 3.1 - 1st Quest.qst"

(I was trying to see if literally anything would happen)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/23/2022 01:56

Try running from a bash terminal? Instead of cmd or PowerShell

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/23/2022 01:57

Otherwise read the docker run shell script and rewrite for windows terminal, it's just one line
also I'm happy to grab these midis for ya

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/23/2022 01:58

Docker works regardless of the host machine, but I did wrap kicking it off in a simple bash script.

Yes please

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/23/2022 05:41

I'll hook you up tmrw

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/24/2022 01:56
