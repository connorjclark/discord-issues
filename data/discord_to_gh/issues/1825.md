checkbox on crystal switches / switch blocks: `uses global state`, uses one of 32 global states instead of one of 32 level-dependant states

checkbox on crystal switches (reqs global state) `set revert timer`, gives attribute option for `revert timer`, a number of frames before the switch reverts itself. Only works on global states.

generic trigger option: byte `Switch State` (pick a state 0 to 31), checkboxes `Global State`, `Trigger when on`, `Trigger when off`. `Global state` works the same as it does on switches, changing what state is being read. The triggers do as they say, triggering based on that state.
This would allow everything in this video, unscripted, fairly easily. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgUn9etdwaQ&ab_channel=SkyLizardGirl

also, `combotype effects` on switch blocks- should trigger it's combo change/cset change when 'triggered'

OK, so, didn't do the generic trigger option for state shit
but gave 256 global states
and set up all the rest
no internet on my desktop though, so I can't push the code changes, or post a build, or post an example video.....
