If you "Move" tiles, it updates references to those tiles. But if you "Undo", it fails to undo those refs, possibly destroying your combos/enemies/weapons, and making you need to re-tile them.

For now, patch this, by disallowing undoing a move operation (and giving the player a warning, with a "don't show again" option, when they use the move operation)

Later, when more insanity is had, perhaps figure out how the ever-living fuck to make undoing undo the reference changes. This will probably require ***entirely rewriting how undo works from scratch***, so not happening in the short term.
