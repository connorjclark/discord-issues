I'm feeling like poking at optimizing some things, so, gonna just list off whatever I manage to do here.
1. I looked at inline user functions. At this point, I understand EXACTLY how I would go about doing it.... with one problem, it wouldn't be any faster at all.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 20:36

2. I played with optimizing `&&` a bit more

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 20:38

The two highlighted sections are before/after of the statement `true && foo(false)`, saving 7 opcodes from previously

This type of optimization applies whether or not you are using `short_circuit`, and is logically 100% equivalent, so there is absolutely no change other than "code go faster nyoom"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 20:42

This is another 7 opcodes, on `false && foo(true)`
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/989990906931318805/989993970199314563/unknown.png?ex=65eb783b&is=65d9033b&hm=7cebeab3211b058f8e881f230838c20a474562c3b9dd612fb1d073a4b4f5c6fd&)
(what the `foo` function returns is fully irrelevant for the ZASM, for the record)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 20:44

`foo(true) && false`, 7 again
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/989990906931318805/989994518248063076/unknown.png?ex=65eb78be&is=65d903be&hm=826e95183ea432ce56858a03a918bdfa4824f32b2649baab8c1439d4df8b997c&)
`foo(false) && true`, 7 again
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/989990906931318805/989994702122147870/unknown.png?ex=65eb78ea&is=65d903ea&hm=df46d12a2075b73c00699709685bb8b69b0540bbbfd82ee1c34ac5ebbb4c6258&)
so really, any `&&` where there is a constant, but the WHOLE expression is not constant, should be ~7 opcodes smaller.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/24/2022 20:49

It's not exactly equivalent

Side effects
If the dropped parts of the clause did something to set global state...
So, might be breaking
Might be misreading you
Ok def am nvm!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 20:51

No, any function call still occurs
and side effects would happen
it just cuts out 7 opcodes of junk
because, `true && foo()`, you only really need to call `foo()` and force the result to 0 or 1
Before, it
```cpp
 SETV d2,1
 PUSHR d2
 PUSHR d4
 PUSHV 0.0014
 PUSHV 0
 GOTO 87
 POP d4
 POP d3
 CASTBOOLF d2
 CASTBOOLF d3
 ADDR d2,d3
 COMPAREV d2,0.0002
 SETMOREI d2```
did that
The first 2 opcodes parse the `true`
the next 5 call the function
then it pops the true, forces BOTH registers to `0 or 1`, adds them, and compares the result to `2`, setting the truthy state of that comparison to the output
...if both were variables, this would be necessary (also this code was compiled with short-circuit DISABLED, that would itself save a tiny bit more)
but, since we have a constant `true` in the mix
we can optimize it out
```cpp
 PUSHR d4
 PUSHV 0.0012
 PUSHV 0
 GOTO 59
 POP d4
 CASTBOOLI d2```
The first 5 are, in fact, the same 5 from above that handle the function call
and then the last one forces the result to `0 or 1`
so, pure optimization of junk that doesn't affect the logic
In the versions where it's a `false` instead of a `true`, you'll notice it just has `SETV d2,0` instead of `CASTBOOLI d2`
because, the return of the function call doesn't matter when it's `&& false`, the result is always false

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 20:57

...now to try to do the same optimization for `||`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 21:02

And that should be done, easily enough
the logic mostly copy+pastes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 21:37

OOOOKay
I should have `&&`, `||`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `~~` ('approximately equal to' operator), and `^^` (boolean XOR) all optimized
`&&` and `||` are by far the largest optimization there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 21:42

Wow, coming back to all of this with a better grasp of how ZASM works as a whole makes it look a hell of a lot easier than it used to
Just optimized `+` by a fair bit, so clearly there's a good amount more I can still do

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 06/24/2022 21:53

what does the ~~ operator do in Zscript?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 22:00

`Approximately equal to`
so, `==`, except, `0 ~~ 0.0001` is true
`#option APPROX_EQUAL_MARGIN [value]` can set the margin of error for the comparison
default IIRC is `0.0010`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/24/2022 22:01

if i understand correctly, this is just optimizing the assembly for usages of constants in branches that you wouldn't expect to see in real code?
like just for fun?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 22:01

These branches COULD occur in real code
and keep in mind that anywhere I have a constant `true` or `false`
could be ANY constant expression
which could be like
`(WIDTH / 2) + (MARGIN*2) >= MIN_WIDTH`
or any complex series of constant values
so, some could pop up in real code more than you'd expect
Also, by having less ZASM generated, it reduces quest filesize a bit too

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/24/2022 22:03

Why would a script _want_ to do conditionals on constants tho? It's always either true or false

I guess if you have a bunch of constants that you treat like configuration at the top of the script it makes more sense to me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 22:03

Aye, usually it's for configuration things

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/24/2022 22:03

cool cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 22:03

One nice one is
```cpp
const bool DEBUG = true;
//
if(DEBUG)
{
    printf("Some big debug message here\n", params);
}```
Right now, that would compile the same as though the `if` wasn't there at all, since it's always true
....but if you swap that constant to `false`, suddenly, it won't generate assembly for ANYTHING inside the function
which, requires at least one opcode per char of the string literal, so that's a sizable amount

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/24/2022 22:04

oh sweet
totally missed that
you're doing dead-code elimination

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 22:04

That one isn't new now, I did that one a couple years back
but yeah, any time something is `constant at compile-time`, it can be handled smarter
In a lot of places, it might be as simple as
```cpp
SETR d2,const_val
PUSHR d2
... ;some other block
POP d3
... ;some comparison```
to
```cpp
... ;some other block
SETV d3,const_val
... ;some comparison```
which, internally, is
```cpp
visit(left, param);
addOpcode(new OPushRegister(new VarArgument(EXP1)));
visit(right, param);
addOpcode(new OPopRegister(new VarArgument(EXP2)));
addOpcode(new OCompareRegister(new VarArgument(EXP2), new VarArgument(EXP1)));
```
vs
```cpp
visit(right, param);
addOpcode(new OCompareImmediate2(new LiteralArgument(*lval), new VarArgument(EXP1)));```or```cpp
visit(left, param);
addOpcode(new OCompareImmediate(new VarArgument(EXP1), new LiteralArgument(*rval)));```
...I am not fully done, as I do need to add `OCompareImmediate2` as a version that takes `literal, register` instead of `register, literal`
similar for `OSubImmediate2` and `ODivImmediate2` (and `OModuloImmediate2`)
but yeah, it's all basically just fine-tuning on a `saving single opcodes from basic operations` level
because like, 7 opcodes saved in `&&` could add up if you get those savings in a lot of places

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 22:12

Also, with div and modulo, I should be able to provide better compile-time `div by 0` checking
so now `Trace(x / 0)` will give a compile warning, where before it would not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 22:41

Ternary had some optimization to do, apparently

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 23:18

BWAHAHAHA
Now if you were to
`switch(5)`
any constant value
it now only generates the assembly for the matching case
including if that is the default case
If it would be the default case, but there IS no default case, it generates simply nothing.
Well, not totally true, it generates at minimum a single `NOP`
could probably make it not if it doesn't need it....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 23:22

yep, simple enough

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 23:33

...whew.
Think that's everything there is in `BuildVisitors.cpp` to optimize

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 23:46

And, the alternate versions of the opcodes done, so now I can actually test it.... or, rather, ask some people to test it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2022 01:16

Oh, and uh, didn't update this thread with it, but it was all tested, and fell apart like 5 times. Thanks, Moosh, for the help. All fixed and merged.
