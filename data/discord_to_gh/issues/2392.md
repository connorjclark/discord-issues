If newer player movement is enabled, charging a spin attack restricts the player to only moving in the direction they were initially facing at the start of the charge, no matter the actual direction of the input. For example, if the player is facing east, begins to charge a spin attack, then attempts to move north, the player moves east.

Video below demonstrates the bug. Note that I am trying to move to kill the gels with a spin attack but cannot move in the correct direction while charging to reach them. Disregard the interaction with the ladder, as that's a script attempting to force Link to face north when atop those tiles.

@ Phosphor does this fix it? (add this file to the latest nightly)

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Phosphor does th…"): The latest nightly crashes upon creating a new save file

=== @ Phosphor 05/28/2023 17:40

So I can't even test and see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/28/2023 17:43

use `Quest->Test` in ZQ, that still works
(That crash will be fixed shortly as well)
(but, would be good to know if this is fixed first)
@ Phosphor
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Phosphor does th…"): ...err, actually, the crash on creating save file ***should be fixed by adding this file***

=== @ Phosphor 05/28/2023 17:47

It seemingly did not fix the crash but the movement thing is mostly fixed. The player does seem to slightly vibrate when moving diagonally though?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/28/2023 17:48

???

=== @ Phosphor 05/28/2023 17:48

Am I just crazy?

It's like he's slightly jostling around by like a single pixel as he moves

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/28/2023 17:49

that might be your sprites?
it doesn't look to do that in the classic tileset, so

=== @ Phosphor 05/28/2023 17:50

Do you see any difference? This is with old movement.

Maybe I am just crazy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/28/2023 17:51

the bobbing while walking kinda jitters a little

=== @ Phosphor 05/28/2023 17:52

Odd considering his head bobs only up and down between frames
whatever. This build also fixed a bug I was about to report with the sword sprite persisting atop combos with slash secret flags for a few seconds before disappearing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/28/2023 17:53

?????

=== @ Phosphor 05/28/2023 17:55

Now it's not happening in the older build??? 
Am I getting gaslit by ZC
nvm recreated it

=== @ Phosphor 05/28/2023 17:57

Let me see if it still happens in the current build, because it's seemingly random when it happens

=== @ Phosphor 05/28/2023 17:59

Yeah it's still happening
