=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 08:43

put stuff here woohoo
not every single thing will necessarily be added
(for instance, probably not gonna add heavy step combos or remote bombs or such; users can add what they need)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:45

new features note to self
-iron boots
-heavy step combos
-remote bombs and super bombs (were in 2.50 but no unique tiles)
-giant enemies
-lttp landmine (step combo that makes an explosion)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 08:45

but, we've added signposts, crystal switches, pits

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:45

well they should at least have graphics so users know the possibility
not necessarily implemented, just the tiles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 08:45

well you can use any switch graphic as a heavy switch
and there's not an easy way to make a graphic that blatantly looks "heavy", and not like just another variant

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:46

bad design and colourblind-unfriendly
oh this could do with improvement but

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 08:46

I did make use of generic combos
because I added lttp-ish torches
for new dark rooms

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:46

shoe symbol buttons (made for BS but I can in classic)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 08:46

which use a generic that is `burn->Next`
please do tile exports in 2.53 or 2.55 if possible
so it doesn't have the white hatches everywhere

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:47

sure thing
these aren't to be used anyhow

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:48

would you mind making a small githuh repo of exported tile pages? i.e. pagexxx.png
so i can see when they're edited, and import/draw on top of the newest versions
and send pull requests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 08:49

uhhhhh
that
would be absolutely ass
like, legimitately terrible to work with

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:49

ok but at least please post here the page number(s) when you've edited a tile page
so i don't draw over an outdated version and accidentally put tiles over where you'd drawn them, and can ask for/edit the newest version

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 08:50

page 0 was edited, the blue frame now is black background instead of transparent
page 55 is no longer empty
and every fucking page no longer uses any black other than color 15
I literally did a recolor operation on *the entire tileset*
and the palette has been updated
so uh
give me a minute to wrap up for now and I'll give you the quest file
I'm about to head off for the night anyway

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:51

sorry for the hassle but i'm sure you'd prefer to not import my pages and realize YOUR additions on formerly-blank tiles got overwritten with mine

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:52

oh yeah is there a page heading font page? i forgot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 08:55

I just ripped from surrounding pages
I think there is somewhere

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:01

oh
and anything that used the greens in cset 7 is going to need to be fixed
because I moved them
there are now blues there
so the color ramp matches cset 8
and cset 10 now has similar purple ramps

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908275824703197235/908280595744948224/unknown.png?ex=65e982b9&is=65d70db9&hm=85e0ccbba549939c529356040c40f3e41cc215a12a1148f068504e4d19cd1bce&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:07

also, we need sideview swimming sprites for all the different action types.... in each of the animation styles......

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:33

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): awesome
though can't they be moved to cset 5
and we need to fix whatever's going on with cset 9 - i'll take a look to see if anything uses them tomorrow
and imo the treasure chest combos should be CSet 1 like a NES tile, and replace that index 13 blue with index 1 brown
and remove cset 8 blue altogether

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:34

cset 9 is per level palette
and anything you can do to fix things is welcome; the palette is a mess as-is
going to post a nightly build with the updates thus far soon

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:35

suggestion for cset 7 - make the new ramp sort of more aquaish, to match those zelda 2 enemies, like how cset 8's dark red is meant to match dark red zelda 2 enemies. i can provide a ramp tomorrow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:35

it was added to match the red ramp that already existed below it
and is used for crystal switches I think

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:36

yeah and that red ramp is zelda 2 style so the blue ramp should be as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:36

as long as the switch blocks stay looking ok

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:37

we also need to get rid of duplicate whites
i'll make sure they do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:37

there are 3 variants of each color of switch block; a darker, a lighter, and a medium

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:38

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "we also need to get rid of du…"): i know some extra link mirror shield tiles (the 2.10 and below ones) use this white, but do other csets need compatibility with it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:38

the lighter is the only one that has combos, but the others are there as alternate options
not a clue

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:38

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the lighter is the only one t…"): oh yeah just to be clear
this will be a majority of my tiles
not comboed or in enemy/item editor
just alternate options

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:38

that's fine
pretty much all the additions of mine are on one page, for reference
all on.... IIRC 55?
right between dungeon blocks and spikes

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:39

oh and can you export less than one tile page at a time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:39

nope

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:39

welp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:39

but, all I need you to give me is the `.qst` back
so don't need you to export

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:40

i guess for things like part-shallow/swimmable water and part-none/spike tiles, i'll just post a page full of miscellaneous tiles and you can paste them as you please
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "but, all I need you to give m…"): wait you want me to edit the .qst instead of posting pages?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:40

since you'll need to do palette work anyway
the qst makes more sense

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:40

uh well let's see if this pans out
i know i'm comboing stuff like bomb flowers
so there's a disclaimer that if you don't like anything, feel free to remove it from the combo list

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:41

#deleted-channel new nightly
just `File->New` in the nightly, and do not select a ruleset if the ruleset dialog pops up

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:42

thank you
sorry to be sounding like zoria i just want to ward off any potential complaints and remind you that i'm okay with you editing/removing/reversing any editorial decisions of mine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:42

we are very open to changes right now, so, I doubt I would end up caring to remove much
but thank you regardless
there are literally >700 free tile pages

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:43

no problem
by the way
do lanterns and attack rings have unique sprites or do i need to rustle some up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:43

There were *already* sprites for them, actually
there was an unused ring sprite with a sword on it
and lantern sprites as candle alternatives

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:44

btw a small request to edit that message

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:44

if you want to add more alternatives, feel absolutely free; but they are covered as is

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:44

you can link the thread
#1170
for visibility

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:44

oh crap the link broke when I copy+pasted
I did that originally
pings don't break when you copy paste
channel links don't break either
but *thread* links *do* break
ffs discord

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:45

also hrm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:46

(I had pasted the message in DM to dimi for review before posting)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:46

do i need to make tile pages for link's swimming actions for each style/shield
i don't think they'll all fit on his original pages

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:46

the sideview swimming sprites are needed for every style and for each shield, yes

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:46

i know that
but can i make like a page 2 for each style/shield
the new tiles won't fit on page 1

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:46

certainly
as long as you update the LTMs appropriately so they still work
keeping things "as they were" is not very important right now; re-organization of anything is perfectly fine
as long as anything that *relies* on the tiles is updated accordingly

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:47

is there any easy way to insert a blank tile page?
though since there's not much below the link tile pages i suppose i could just cut + paste everything except his first page down one page

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:48

err, there doesn't seem to be any insert for tiles

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:48

and then continue in that vein

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:48

but `copy`->`move` should work fine
and should auto-update references as long as you use `move` and not `paste`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:50

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "but `copy`->`move` should wor…"): so the optimal way would be to start at the lowest page (z3 mirror shield), copy-> move it down one page, fill in the page above it with swimming stuff, copy-> move down the lowest 4 pages (z3 magic/z3 magic swimming/z3 mirror/z3 mirror swimming), fill in the page above it with swimming stuff, copy->move down the lowest 6 pages...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:51

I'd just move the mirror shield down howevermany pages to start with

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:51

oh!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:51

so since you'll need to add a 2nd page for `none`, `small`, `magic` above that, just move it down 3 pages
then move the magic down 2
and the small down 1
and fill in the gap pages that creates

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:51

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so since you'll need to add a…"): i'll actually have to move it down 12 pages
since 3 styles x 4 shield states = 12

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:52

aye, of course
so it'd be 12, then 11, then 10, then 9.....
but the link sprites are, in fact, the *literal final pages*
so there's nothing below them to get in the way

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:52

ah good
i thought there was some misc. unused link junk (i.e. hurt sprites) but no it's *above* those pages

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:53

oh, and page 108 has the font stuff for page headers

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2021 09:53

Currently, sideview swimming ignores shields cause I wasn't thinking when I added something to the shield check

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:53

convenient design? in *my* 2.50 qst.dat?!? it's more likely than you'd think!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2021 09:54

But uh, having a QR would be effortless so I'd expect that to be QR-based in the near future

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:54

oh right gbc swimming don't have shields i think because shields are a button item in those games

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2021 09:54

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:54

so, the tiles should include the shield on the sprite

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:54

but alucard wanted it because he had z1-style shields

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:54

and if someone wants to use shieldless, they can just copy the shieldless sprite over all of them

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2021 09:54

So including shielded sprites is good to give people options

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:55

a very genuine thank you, P-Tux, as this will be an ***enormous*** help to us

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:55

well you guys have been great about adding my code ideas, it's the least i can do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:55

<a:hugheart:876927396215930930> <a:hugheart:876927396215930930> <a:hugheart:876927396215930930> <a:hugheart:876927396215930930>

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:55

oh what a coincidence that we were typing those thanks at the same time

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2021 09:56

lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 09:57

also, we will probably add more subscreen options, but not until we are in beta
because we'll want to add subscreens that have slots for all the new itemclasses, including any that we might add in the future
(any edits you want to make to the existing subscreens, of course, is fine)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 09:58

~~magic container pieces please~~
though... that'd be a rabbit hole if people wanted arrow expansion and bomb expansion pieces
maybe never mind lol
at least it's easy to script if *i* want to use it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 10:00

Some notes:
Enemy tiles at the start
-P40 = OW ground tiles
-P44 = mountains/trees/objects
-P50 = dungeon stuff
-P55 = crystal switches/torches/signs (my new stuff)
-P63 = minimaps
-P75 = maps
-P80 = items
-P100 = life/magic counters
-P108 = fonts for headers
-P120 = Link
(feel free to rearrange anything you want, but that's where things are as of *now*; should make it easy for you to jump to sections)
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 10:01

and by pressing P lol
i felt like a stooge when someone pointed THAT out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 10:01

the `counter piece` idea has been floated around, but to make it generic to any counter would be less easy, and take some work

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 10:02

yeah and again i might make a scripted quest with someone anyways, so not too bad for my purposes since it can be scripted there
by the way is it possible to export 2.55 tile pages and palettes (=<255) to 2.53 in case someone wants my stuff
or maybe i should just make one big loose tile submission

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 10:05

I mean, tile page exports are `.png`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 10:05

oh and uh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 10:05

if you do a tile *pack* export, I have no idea if that would load in 2.53; it may well not

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 10:05

so moving everything down x tiles updates all tile dependencies except LTMs
...and anything else?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 10:06

Should be LTMs and scripts... and no scripts are in the tileset

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 10:06

great thanks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 10:06

if anything else doesn't update, we don't know it, and that would be a bug to report
Do beware that using `undo` on a `move` operation *fails* to undo the dependency update
and, we would have fixed that if it were even remotely feasible to fix, but it's.... just not

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 10:07

backups huh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 10:07

for the record, whenever you do something
it stores a backup of the entire tile pages
and when you click undo
it just.... restores that
it has no idea what *type* of operation it's undoing

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 10:07

yeah i figured lol
i mean the dependencies are a pretty complex thing and i'm impressed that zquest can even do it in one direction

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 10:08

anyway, big thanks again; I'm exhausted as absolute fuck, so, good night
<a:hugheart:876927396215930930><a:hugheart:876927396215930930><a:hugheart:876927396215930930><a:hugheart:876927396215930930>

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 16:47

so question
health-depleting shallow and swimmable water will be purple or green
...what colour would it be for health-restoring?
white or gold is uh...

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 19:26

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) when you said to make a new quest in the newest nightly
you said something like when it says pick ruleset click cancel?
and what do i do when it prompts me "convert all water combos to non-solid"?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 20:49

it shouldn't prompt that if you cancel?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 20:51

frankly I haven't gotten that popup in months
because it popping up is a config

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/11/2021 21:19

Just for the to-do list, the classic tileset inserts the now unused classic.zh items into active subscreens (Magic dungeon items, plus the special scrolls) in the 11/11 build. The two scroll items are pointing to black tiles, so they are invisible but there if you check around the subscreen objects.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 21:51

yeah we're working on that
well i'm not but emily said she'll configure the subscreen once the item lineup is finalized

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 21:53

oh hey can i set the Guys' tiles to different ones for old and new?
abei, ama, merchant, zelda - black, non-transparent eyes
goriya/moblin - neutral standing frame akin to BS Zelda
sadly this won't affect zelda's ending tile but oh well
i'll likely leave it on the nes-like transparent black eyes
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "oh hey can i set the Guys' ti…"): er, to be clear, i physically CAN, but would this be acceptable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 21:58

I have no idea how old/new fucking works
and have never touched it
sooooo

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 21:59

each enemy has two dropdowns for animation style
they use the first animation style if the new enemy tiles quest rule is off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 22:00

feel free to do whatever

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 22:00

and the second if it is on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 22:00

because you know more than I do

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 22:00

mm thanks
i just knew you weren't sure if you wanted guys to be exposed to the user
and me editing something because right now guys are exposed to the user might "break that rule" y'know

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 22:07

I want to eventually make it so you can make custom guys

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 22:10

good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 22:32

oof
so I made item cellars and stuff sideview
but apparently I missed the fact that there is an empty top row of those screens
so, the top row needs solid blocks, and ladder combos at the entrance/exit points
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 22:34

what like... invisible ladder combos?
or visible ones

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 22:34

good question

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2021 22:35

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Do beware that using `undo` o…"): moving tiles being mapped to the same key as mapping combos is so goddamn stupid
especially because of this

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 19:54

New Enemy Tiles QR can't affect csets right

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 19:55

might make a feature request for a bs zelda csets rule if you don't mind (list of enemy/guy, item, and sprite IDs + csets to change them to)
honestly should have been in 1.92/2.10 but whatever

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 19:58

it might be nice to have that on by default in the BS+ rulesets for instance

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 22:24

actually never mind
bs zelda just changes too much to be feasible
sword animation, trap speed, enemy HP...

=== @ P-Tux7 11/13/2021 22:28

so thinking of adding BS and LTTP dungeon sets, modified for NES of course
i know BS translates fairly well to NES, but what is you guys' opinion of LTTP?
(and before anyone asks, MAYBE simplified mountains)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/14/2021 02:22

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Sword beams shatter sprites might be bugged when firing horizontally
or rather, not set up right

=== @ Alucard648 11/14/2021 23:27

May I suggest tossing in floor tiles with letters and numbers inscribed on them?
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=tiles&id=1382

do the different link pages even have a purpose?
it's not like changing the link animation style changes the tile pages used automatically or anything, does it?

no, but they are there so you can change it for whatever style you want

don't forget #deleted-channel

=== @ vlamart 11/15/2021 18:02

Oh yeah, I was making a new "Classic Nth Quest." When you defeat a giant Tektite, it leaves behind a shell (the white one), that when struck, either spawns a normal spawn item, or many of the small Tektites (scripted though now lost)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 18:33

ooh!
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) a few questions
1. is it better to have a readme in the script buffer or as an external .txt

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 21:01

(replying to @ vlamart "Oh yeah, I was making a new "…"): did your hard drive crash?

=== @ vlamart 11/15/2021 21:04

Mostly lost in an unorganised backup, it's 50/50 if it's there or not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 23:07

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "1. is it better to have a rea…"): External

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 00:42

and 2. should i even consider the "rulesets" or just pick the ones i think are best?
like having new enemy tiles on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 00:42

The rules should be set correctly already
if anything seems like it would be better differently, please ask

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 00:42

(by not selecting one, right?)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 00:43

aye, don't select one in the dialog

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 00:43

ok the reason i ask is i know certain rulesets have hardcoded places for stuff like link tiles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 00:44

???
no they don't
all rulesets do is toggle QRs
and, a couple will ask if you want to convert every water combo to non-solid
...which really should be moved to a separate tool

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 00:44

huh i thought they set the link animation style

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 00:46

nope, they just set QRs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 20:23

The tile format is in-row, so you put the tiles just in order
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): ^ex.
They don't *need* to be 8-bit, but they can't be different csets from each other, so 8-bit is smart
(That example uses a 2-frame animation)

=== @ vlamart 11/17/2021 20:26

Oh, so a 4-frame potion would need 4 empty bottles at the beginning of the row?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 20:26

Yep
It uses the ID of the bottle contents times the frame count as a tile offset
Kinda like how LTMs work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 20:31

It can have a max of 65 "slots", where the first is always the empty bottle, and the order of the rest is quest setup-dependant

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 20:32

Thus far it's `empty`, `red`, `green`, `blue`, `fairy`, `milk(2use)`, `milk(1use)`
But that is entirely editable per-quest

DOES THIS MEAN THAT WE CAN HAVE ARGUMENTS FOR EACH FRAME IN THE PLAYER TILE CHOOSER

go into one of those tile selectors and press x on the keyboard

i recall someone complaining about how big link covers up his sword
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908275824703197235/911759850776694884/zc_screen00004.png?ex=65ecf088&is=65da7b88&hm=269428d09e60792c50685eb2087f7412a88fce23e41d955df67c7d39ea93bc5f&)
so how's that fixed
is it done by making the sword stab/slash sprite 2x2 tiles or bigger, and using x/y graphic offsets to put the graphic where it needs to go?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:30

It doesn't affect the sword
It only affects the hammer, and only while sideview swimming

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:30

(a longer sword or swords spawning offset from where they normally do are their own cans of worms; i meant a sword that LOOKS the proper distance away)
no i just mean graphic-wise
and in the weapons/misc sprite editor for the graphic that the stab/slash uses, not link's sprites

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:31

and only because sideview swimming sprites tend to have Link's head at a lower position, so holding the hammer above his head looks really weird otherwise

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:31

the hammer thing just reminded me of this sorry if it's not a particularly great channel
though it's of interest to me for a full-size z2 or lttp link!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:32

Is it okay if I save that for a later alpha (or even just 101)?
100 is way behind schedule as is
I need to finish all the quest rules, but I'm not gonna be happy until I've fixed every broken thing they're currently touching

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:33

uh, sure?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:34

And I also need to fix Ganon's invisibility bullshit, which I'm still trying to think of a way to do that

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:34

it's not a request or anything given that i'm asking about current sprite graphic offset technology

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:34

(fixing it isn't the hard part, the hard part is implementing it in a way that doesn't feel unpolished)

hell i may as well try it and see what happens
sorry for the bother

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:34

Adding an offset to the sword isn't impossible

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:35

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Adding an offset to the sword…"): yeah i said i WASN'T requesting a spawn offset, just asking about the VISUAL offset

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:35

I believe the sword itself is already just a series of offsets of Link's position

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:35

the sword would still spawn next to link as usual it'd just look bigger

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:35

so adding a visual offset would be easy

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:35

oh so it would use the same idea as hammer offsets?
i'll FR request it then, thanks

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/20/2021 23:36

Uh, unsure
Honestly hammer offsets currently are jank in how you access them
because they actually overlap the swim pound sprites

by the way @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)
i know the whole point of the classic set is to use copyrighted nintendo stuff
but do you think we should remove the non-nintendo stuff so we're only offending one copyright
this includes the legacy of the wizard tiles (npcs, items, sideview tiles), outlands final fantasy trees, robowarrior tiles (outlands candle/lantern and boulder/eye) and god knows what else from outlands

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 12/16/2021 05:44

Wait those Outlands tiles are from other games?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2021 05:44

eh, no fucks given

=== @ P-Tux7 12/16/2021 05:49

Update to include active suns
Cursed because Ocarina of Time cursed us with cursed sun faces

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 08:58

The eyes are from Stone Tower Temple, right?

=== @ Orithan 12/19/2021 09:04

The eyes are supposed to be the eye switches from Ocarina of Time, adjusted to lay flush with the wall

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 09:13

Can we use them in Cambria?
~~Also I want to use that sun as a Digdogger, especially in 2.55 where you can use light to make it split~~
wait can light kill enemies or not? i know it does for gibdos and redeads

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 09:41

~~Should I modify the Angry Sun as an alternative sun switch...~~

=== @ Orithan 12/19/2021 09:48

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Can we use them in Cambria?"): Sure.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 11:17

err, the light puzzles? nope
doesn't uh, exactly, exist as a weapon or anything

Improved bottle graphics

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:07

will need to make them 8-bit

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:08

Oh right, because of the way bottles work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:08

they are all displayed in whatever cset the bottle item is set to
so yeah
4-bit just kinda doesn't work

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:08

The important part is that they are closer to the NES graphical style

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:08

yeah, certainly

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:08

The bottles at the bottom are in 8-bit mode

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:08

won't need the 4-bit rows, but yeah, that's definitely better

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:11

With that in mind I think the only improvement I can make to the bottles insofar is to change up the green potions. Change it so they use the CSet 0 green for the base and the light green in CSet 5 for the highlight of the potion

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:13

@ Orithan if you want to put some stuff in the quest file, feel free
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908275824703197235/923503468637990972/classic_qst-19DEC2021.qst?ex=65e98520&is=65d71020&hm=f6caa72fd45730e940c2371ac9ddc93a1e227dfa4ad6f528e53db903e0fbc85e&
just be sure to upload it here when you're done with it

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:13

Tbh I would put extra greens into CSet 5 instead of CSet 0 but I can understand why you put that one there because it's used for the magic gauge

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:14

yeah, I shoved it with the subscreen stuff

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:14

I did expand the classic CSets for Soul Hunter
Might be able to fetch the extra ramps from it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:15

All I've really done so far is improved the red/blue ramps and made a purple ramp to match
and added the one green to cs0
feel free to do whatever you think will be good, and let me know when you've got it finished

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 09:16

(replying to @ Orithan "Tbh I would put extra greens…"): I wouldn't do that
CSet 5 can now be a level palette

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:16

A101 should be coming out soon
and ^ what deedee said

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:16

So wait what's happening now?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 09:16

doesn't make sense to have the default tileset not allow you to use it
(replying to @ Orithan "So wait what's happening now?"): CSets 1, 5, 7, and 8 can now be level palettes
(QR-checked, of course)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:18

A101 will be out shortly with that addition
among the many bugfixes we've gotten done recently

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 09:18

CSet 1 I'm still iffy about because it's used by the subscreen

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:18

With that AFIAK all CSets except 10 and 11 change

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 09:18

and 0
So it might result in a different meta of building your subscreens in 10 and 11? Who knows

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:19

I'm not sure how to feel about that because it means fewer colours to use for enemies and items for the whole game

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:19

Frankly, why not allow `0`,`10`, and `11` as well @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?
if you can pick which rows apply via qrs
let the user choose where they want them to be
the only one that can't really be is 6, because ring palettes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 09:19

(replying to @ Orithan "I'm not sure how to feel abou…"): Csets 7, 8, and 9 are intended to still be used for enemies

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:20

you can do more level-specific enemies

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:20

And what about items?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:20

and again, each cset is a separate QR
so you toggle each one you want to be level-specific or not

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:20

Items are one of those things that you want to be the same colour throughout the game

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 09:21

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Frankly, why not allow `0`,`1…"): Because it means doing more qst-loading fuckery
but I'm gonna have to do it anyways...
not for this alpha though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:21

but anyway, @ Orithan , it's all optional on QRs
so, at worst, you have exactly the same you already have now
but if you WANT more level-specific stuff, you can toggle it on

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:22

Mhm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:23

P-tux in particular has been asking for such forever, as a true LTTP tileset *requires* it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:24

But anyway, you can feel free to update whatever graphics and palettes you'd like for classic if you want to spend the time on it

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:24

Understandable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:25

I've just been editing that qst file in the latest builds and saving it, then I can grabber it into the .dat
have it by date in a folder

so just send me any updates and I can add them to builds

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:25

LttP was pretty light on enemy colours AFIAK

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:25

it had a lot of dungeon colors though, apparently

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 09:26

AFIAK the majority of common enemies fit into the same 16 colour palette

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:26

I really can't wait for the rewrite
when we can just allow truecolor stuff

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 09:28

there is a fun thing i can do now
iirc outlands had per-level csets 7 and 8 so i might as well update xmuppetsb's quest with it

i wonder how plug and play nth enemy has the bomb is too

Guy (Zelda)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 20:12

Good idea honestly
it's annoying accidentally picking the Goriya Guy instead of the Goriya enemy

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 20:44

tfw you have to bring 10 baits

=== @ P-Tux7 01/22/2022 22:17

Crystal Switch reset combos - Set to Blue/Set to Orange
The self-triggering kind that only exist in one "colour state"
For the LTTP-like effect that if you continue, die, or use Farore's Wind/Magic Mirror, it resets the blocks to a specified state.
They're invisible and are just used as invisible FFCs or layered combos

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2022 00:49

those combos would trigger if you returned to the screen though

=== @ P-Tux7 01/23/2022 01:09

hrm

=== @ P-Tux7 02/14/2022 21:25

uh oh
so the book fire in default tileset is making a magic noise

is the stone of agony still broken?

=== @ P-Tux7 05/09/2022 17:55

item questions:
1. should the candle and lantern be bundled? perhaps L1 and L2 of each class?
2. what, if any, passive items should be disabled as a bunny besides the shield?

=== @ vlamart 05/09/2022 18:06

2. Wouldn't they disable themselves anyways if "Usable as bunny" is unchecked?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/09/2022 18:07

Anything not specifically enabled as bunny does not work as bunny

=== @ vlamart 05/09/2022 18:08

1. I think that's a good idea, maybe as a way to have at least one of every item class in the default setup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/09/2022 18:08

I'd sooner bundle bow+wooden arrow
as an example bundle

=== @ vlamart 05/09/2022 18:11

With the new ammo setup, you wouldn't have to bundle a quiver, but with one, that's 3 items to bundle 😝

=== @ P-Tux7 05/09/2022 18:20

i was suggesting them as a bundle because lantern doesn't really make sense as its own item imo

=== @ P-Tux7 05/09/2022 18:23

also enabling certain passive items as a bunny is necessary for the bunny scripted defense to work - especially if it ever gets added as a non-scripted defense

=== @ P-Tux7 05/09/2022 18:25

because the passive lamp effect and rings *do* work in lttp as a bunny

=== @ P-Tux7 05/09/2022 18:26

while you can't use flippers as a bunny in lttp, it admittedly feels a little cruel to have the player be unable to use them and the ladder as a bunny due to all the varied terrain in zc

=== @ P-Tux7 05/09/2022 18:28

lttp was smart enough to not ever put bunny traps and water in the same room but people WILL do it in zc - especially if any enemy can cause a bunny effect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/09/2022 18:41

`Bow 1, Arrow 1, & Quiver 1 (Bundle)` added
rings & lanterns work as bunny now

=== @ vlamart 05/09/2022 18:52

Also, idea: a "Bunny Only" item flag

=== @ vlamart 05/10/2022 02:53

I feel like there's something to be fleshed out in this half formed idea I had if anyone of you wanna snowball it: bunny only item flag, and leveled moon pearls working together to make a simple "multiple characters" system with specific items being tied to specific moon pearl levels that can be assigned and sorted through in Init Data maybe? (Last part probably the most too ambitious for current in engine)

=== @ vlamart 05/12/2022 22:51

I'm not sure if this would be classic or default related, but are the prepackaged scripts going to be looked over and revised too? Especially since a bunch are now redundant in-engine (with just small visual things (like pushing animation, or items popping out of chests) not being in-engine, but mostly ghost 2.8 enemies stuff that probably are a lot more efficient to script with npc and eweapon scripts now)

=== @ P-Tux7 09/17/2022 00:53

okay so now that items can be enabled as usable even if you have an item jinx, PLEASE set both potion items and the bottle to be usable while jinxed in the default quest
so much for potions curing jinxes if THEY'RE jinxed!

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2022 23:02

all Gloves should be unusable by bunny

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:03

....which is the default state for any item

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2022 23:04

well looks like i've gotta check what *is* usable as a bunny then, thanks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:05

pretty sure the answer in LTTP is "Nothing"
You can push things, but, that requires no item (and there are no "heavy push" blocks with which to check for bracelets)
....Not sure about flippers. Pretty sure they're also a 'no', but IDK if you can even get to water as a bunny to test that normally

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2022 23:09

you're correct that you can't test it normally but the lttp speedrun practice rom confirms it as no

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:09

K, so, yeah, the answer is `nothing`
or well
except the mirror
obviously
because that's kinda the whole point

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2022 23:10

things that work:
-all bottle items (potions, fairy, bees)
-magic mirror
things that don't work
-pegasus boots
-any type of lifting
-flippers
-any shield

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:10

Oh, bottles work?
huh
didn't expect that

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2022 23:10

yup
though not the net, mind you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:11

....though now that I say that I immediately have a faint memory of Andy using a bottle as a bunny to do the camera bug

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908275824703197235/1021196922402373672/unknown.png?ex=65e503bf&is=65d28ebf&hm=a1f626e9cd59e033a3c4aeaa5016851e28cc1c5cb41f6332ac6b9129c3c28614&)
so, that is one to update in the default tileset then

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2022 23:14

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....Not sure about flippers.…"): oh wait you CAN
just buy the flippers, miss the moon pearl in tower of hera, and once agahnim drops you off at the pyramid, descend the pyramid, go right, and go up for a cliff to jump off of into the water
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): yeah, all 4 bottles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:16

oh, is there a cliff you can get to?
I thought you needed to lift something to get to one

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2022 23:17

yeah right at the bottom of the screen above the rocky screen with the moblins just to the right of the pyramid screen
(well not "screens" but whatever...)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2022 06:40

should a few basic scripted npcs be added to the base tileset for sideview swimming enemies?
i feel as though left/right cheep cheep, up/down cheep cheep, and blooper would be neat

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2022 06:40

not anytime soon
keeping scripted stuff out of it for now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2022 11:28

interesting idea; preferably we'd want to make those engine enemies
which is my field of expertise

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2022 02:50

oh yeah were the scripts in the classic tileset zoria's idea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2022 02:57

yes
default quest never has scripts ever again
