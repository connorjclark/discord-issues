Isle of Rebirth broken

in what 2.55 build?
just saying `In 2.55` is very non-specific

=== @ C1 08/10/2022 20:33

Let me check

=== @ C1 08/10/2022 20:34

Alpha 107 build 61

try a more recent build
that's not the most recent

=== @ C1 08/10/2022 21:00

OK sure

=== @ C1 08/10/2022 21:06

I'll make sure to save before this stuff happens

=== @ C1 08/10/2022 22:18

With the latest release, ps4 controller doesn't work anymore

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/10/2022 22:18

separate issue, make a separate report, @ connor in that one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/10/2022 23:37

(replying to @ C1 "OK sure"): did a more recent build fix this issue?
if A108 doesn't fix it, I'd try the latest nightly

=== @ C1 08/13/2022 13:35

Gonna try the nightly

=== @ C1 08/13/2022 13:47

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I'm able to get ZC player to launch one time but if I try to launch it again it doesn't

=== @ C1 08/13/2022 13:56

Nevermind, it just doesn't open new windows (that's good)

=== @ C1 08/13/2022 14:19

Issue is fixed

=== @ C1 08/13/2022 14:20

unfortunately there is another issue
There is a workaround though
