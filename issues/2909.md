A combo type or trigger that is triggered when you are carrying a combo of power X and step on it, like the stone enemies in Bottle Grotto.

Or a specific stereotypical `pot` above your head.  Something to add weight to your footstep to trigger a weighted pressure pad, I take it?

correct
seconding this feature request tbh

Instead of a trigger, it'd make more sense as a conditon
that way it works with other triggers other than just stepping on it
(similar to proximity)
