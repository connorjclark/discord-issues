Even with the shadow sprite set and the "Show Shadows" enemy QR set, enemy shadows don't seem to appear while airborne.

(replying to @ Attempt "Even with the shadow sprite s‚Ä¶"): is enemies move through z-axis checked?

=== @ Attempt 09/30/2023 11:22

oh. that worked...i guess that'd make sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2023 11:22

that would indeed be required for them to actually be *airborne*

=== @ Attempt 09/30/2023 11:23

understandable
hmm. i wonder how hard it'd be to implement shadows without them going through the z-axis

feel free to feature request, though enemy stuff is deedee's territory

=== @ Attempt 09/30/2023 11:24

yeah i'll just add it to my list of "enemy editor additions" once deedee starts on the editor rewrite
