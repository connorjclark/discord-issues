Title says all. For scripting purposes.

hmmmm
so, add access (init data, constants in std_constants) for higher level items...
for subscreen stuff, the map/compass/bigkey/triforce are all really hardcoded bullshit
so I'd want to code something new there
which means I should really give subscreen widgets a proper conditional system

also might wanna expand `lvlitems` to `word` (18 bits is the cap due to zscript int limitations, unless I wanted to deprecate `LItems[]` and give a new way to access them...)

lot to think about here
