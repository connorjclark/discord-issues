Fields in the player menu (and ZScript variables) to determine where item sprites are displayed when held up in the two holding styles.

The item starts at 0,0 of the player by default. So it would overlap a 16x16 Link by default. The default quest (AKA Zelda 1) will have values of 0, -16, -8, and -16 for these to keep it "normal".

-2Hand Held Item X Offset
-2Hand Held Item Y Offset
-1Hand Held Item X Offset
-1Hand Held Item Y Offset

-256 to 255 should be good enough, if not smaller.

Might need a rule allowing the four separate values if the current 1Hand x-offset is just "2Hand x-offset minus 8" or some junk like that.
