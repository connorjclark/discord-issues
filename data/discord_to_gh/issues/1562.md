I'm loving the new darkness system so far but I'm running into a jarring inconsistancy/oversight where fireball and the like don't emit their own light sources and in the immortal words of Dell Cognagher "That ain't right"

This room is a fine example because there's two fireball shooters but their fireballs don't emit any light. What I would like to recommend is the addition of a "Emits Light" checkbox and a light radius box in the sprite data editor

eh, adding that to the sprite data feels a bit weird
though it does make sense to have a way to set it
you CAN set it via scripts

Agreed that there should be a way to do this without scripts, _however_ if all you need is the weapons to emit light, the script to do so is so simple even you could write it:
```eweapon script EmitLight{
    void run(int radius){
        this->LightRadius = radius;
    }
}```
Since fireball shooters are just an enemy, you can give that enemy a weapon script
