just gonna copy and paste this here, Connor said it might be a bug/ not a real error.

Strings had no ordering data

=== @ Anthus 08/25/2023 01:48

Oh, if it matters, the quest in question was Link to Tortuga (<https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&id=158>)

I think this is just a loading 2.10 quest thing
Probably safe to ignore

=== @ Anthus 08/25/2023 01:48

ahh, so they would be unaffected then (right?)
I can test it
well, maybe
save it, and see if any of the strings in the querst are messed up/ not right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2023 01:49

It's the ordering data
So like, you know how you can rearrange the strings?
It's literally just the order

=== @ Anthus 08/25/2023 01:49

yeah. 2.10 didn't have that so this is basically saying "hey there was no order, but it's an error"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2023 01:50

(replying to @ Anthus "yeah. 2.10 didn't have that s…"): Yep. So just ignore.

=== @ Anthus 08/25/2023 01:51

mayhaps add a note that says something like "quests before x.xx had no ordering data"

=== @ P-Tux7 08/25/2023 02:23

or just change the error message to "missing/corrupted" and add "If this quest was imported from a pre-2.5x version of ZQuest, this is likely not to lead to issues." to the bottom
