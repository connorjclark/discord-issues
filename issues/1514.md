``npc->isDead()`` works fine if it is checked on a given enemy once per frame. It bugs the enemy's death animation out if it is checked multiple times a frame by different instances of a script.

If checked twice on a frame the enemy's death animation is blanked out entirely.

There were three LWeapons running scripts that check ``npc->isDead()`` on the NPC before death. There are now two and the enemy's death animation continues running ad infinitum

What the fuck did zoria doooo

. . .
. . .
. . . . . .
The `Dead()` function is a function that runs to check internally if an enemy is dead
This function *RUNS THE FUCKING DEATH ANIMATION WHEN CALLED*
It handles actually killing the enemy
the death sfx
the enemy never return flag
and a lot of things that are not just checking if the enemy is dead

Aka Zoria is an idiot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 13:31

Very very very much so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/07/2022 13:33

So, uh, the fun fix is
it's really simple
instead of returning a call to `Dead()`
...just return the fucking `dying` bool

(meta) thread name was changed: 💊🔓npc isDead() behaves weirdly if read multiple times
#1517 build posted in that thread contains this

=== @ Orithan 04/16/2022 10:34

Late, but confirmed fixed
