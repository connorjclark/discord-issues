@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) The ZQ minimap is drawing during quest load and triggering a read access violation. To trigger this, save a new quest with the default map count, have that be the win_last_quest and then after closing and reopening ZQ to that quest, use File->Open a quest with a higher map count. I'm not confident I understand this enough to fix myself, but hopefully this is enough info to go off of.

This was with the latest code at the time you wrote this right?

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2023 08:43

yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/22/2023 08:44

is it this crash maybe? https://zeldaclassic.sentry.io/issues/4550057772/?project=6563738&query=is%3Aunresolved&referrer=issue-stream&stream_index=0
I havent been able to repro myself

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2023 08:52

I don't think so. The quest name would be Myriad_Worlds or New99

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/22/2023 08:55

If you did this with a local build could you do it again with one from GitHub? Local won't have sentry reporting

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2023 08:57

Sure. Though I wonder if maybe in that case it's a debug mode only problem.
Was happening at `if(Map.Scr(i)->valid&mVALID)` in `static void mmap_draw(int offx, int offy)` of render_minimap.cpp
both getCurMap() and getMapCount() were returning 0

oh nope, crash triggered

What I did:
- Open ZQ
- Create a new quest
- Save as New.qst
- Increase map count to 99
- Save as New99.qst
- Load New.qst again
- Close ZQ so it's stored as the last loaded quest
- Open ZQ
- Try to load New99.qst

Fixed, thanks for the details instructions.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/22/2023 09:24

The fix was making a boolean for when a quest is being loading, and in `MiniMapRTI::prepare` setting the `freeze` property to true when loading a quest. Freezing a RTI means that it will still draw (if visible), but it will only draw from a cached bitmap (it won't call `::render`).

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "The fix was making a boolean…"): And this is why I said to push the issue to you with details instead of trying to fix it ourselves lol
As soon as we reprod it consistently like that it was clear enough it was your recent stuff, made sense to let you handle it clean instead of needing to clean up whatever jank we tried
(which... bool on quest load was the idea, but might not have done the freeze stuff right)
