=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/04/2023 23:30

on main:

1. new quest
2. make 0x0 some palette other than default, copy the screen
3. set some tile in 0x1 to initialize it
4. paste

the mini map won't update color for that screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/04/2023 23:30

I don't think it copies the palette color
Unless you Paste All, or Paste Palette
Do those both work? If so, not a bug.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/04/2023 23:33

yeah that checks out
there's this other minimap related problem tho
tougher to repro, except I can by loading "NewbieBoss.qst" ( didn't try others yet...)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/04/2023 23:33

*oh*

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/04/2023 23:34

hardly any of those things should be there on the bottom half of the rows
and they hide the cursor
(most screens are blank)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/04/2023 23:34

Wtf???

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/04/2023 23:35

(meta) thread name was changed: Minimap hides cursor and shows bogus screens where none exist
seems to be grabbing from the next map up
but even there, the cursor is still hidden underneath....just for the bottom half.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/04/2023 23:36

Both large and compact mode?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/04/2023 23:42

just for compact mode.
if i switch to expanded mode the bug goes away, but bottom portion of screen sticks around

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/04/2023 23:42

....WTF

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 00:57

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "tougher to repro, except I ca…"): need a quest file to repro this, I don't seem to be able to repro it myself

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 00:58

It's the demo quest from newbie boss script on database

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 00:59

and... what in particular did you *do* to cause it?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 01:00

I opened zquest on a Mac.
I'll try windows later.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 01:00

Let me build up a release build incase it just is a non-debug problem
but, barring that, might be a mac issue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 01:00

Try resetting whatever cfg you have.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 01:00

ah, that too, fair

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 01:00

I tried release mode too, same

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 01:00

hmmm
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Try resetting whatever cfg yo…"): nada. Looks like a mac issue.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 01:04

It's probably an undefined behavior issue, is my guess.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 01:04

probably?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 01:04

Well there's not really anything Mac specific in this part of the code
But we are using different compilers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 01:05

aye, so
yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 01:05

Which can surface undefined behavior

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 01:05

you'll want to look at the area that calls `jwin_draw_minimap_frame`
currently L6120 zquest.cpp
the loop just under that handles drawing the squares

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 01:06

It's extremely odd that it persists through switching modes though
most of the bitmaps are entirely re-generated and cleared when you switch modes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 01:09

.....and yeah, that's about all the help I have to give. This is such a weird looking thing that I have not a single clue what to look at, even knowing the exact section of code that handles the draws
gotta be some weird memory shit of some sort

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 03:48

Huh, I got it to happen on windows now.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 03:50

huh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:07

narrowed it down a bit (some commits just don't render the minimap at all...)

```
There are only 'skip'ped commits left to test.
The first bad commit could be any of:
43a971aa53f40864d74fd933ae78d996336a4fa9
be263b0c2af538c9e69e45a8d240e25ea2da5ef6
142f6716d129d95b0cb1cf2d27bfcd03662b3561
We cannot bisect more!

```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:11

can't be `be263b0c2af538c9e69e45a8d240e25ea2da5ef6`, that one didn't edit source- it literally just added a txt file with a todo list in it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:16

...wish I could help more but I still can't repro the issue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:17

I wasn't able to see it more than just once on windows.
But happens all the time on Mac.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:19

I'm completely baffled by this
I legitimately have no idea how this is *possible*
the cursor square is drawn after all the map stuff is drawn, every time
if the map stuff is drawn, it immediately draws the cursor afterwards
so there should be no possible case in which the map stuff covers the cursor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:22

....just thought of the idea of some `clip_rect` shenanigans
but, the only call setting the clip rect of that bitmap that runs outside of small mode
...sets it to the whole bitmap size.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:24

btw there's also massive flickering but, i've been ignoring that for now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:24

how massive?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:24

_might_ be just in Debug mode, but it suggests some funky memory bugs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:25

I did make it so the main draw loop clears the screen bitmap each 'frame' now
but, I don't get "massive flickering" as a result of that....
(it shouldn't be updating the render until it's done with all the draws on top of the cleared bitmap)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:27

hmm, maybe the `update_hw_screen()` at the end of `void refresh` should be `force=true`?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:28

idk, backburner for now.
first few frames in ZQ render this....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:29

...???

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:29

just like massive randomness, the `curmap` is 0 yet it is finding screens valid that shouldnt be on map 0, so I guess it has loaded garbage into the screens data

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:30

it also is missing all of the squares, and the compact/expand button
....the compact/expand button draws unconditionally with every screen refresh, same as the Main Menu.
And same as the `Drawing Mode` button, directly to its' right, which DID draw?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:31

don't read into that, I'm just pausing at random points inside refresh
i suppose this was a partial draw?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:32

It shouldn't be able to partially draw during refresh
it doesn't `update_hw_screen()` until the end
....oh
......oh
..........except it does run the main menu draw

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:32

L31396 zquest.cpp is the first refresh call that is not garbage...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:32

which might call update_hw_screen itself
.....what calls to refresh are occurring before that?
that is right after it sets the current map

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:33

alrighty it isn't garbage, it just is rendering all the map 0 FIRST then setting to map 1 from history and rendering again. silly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:34

..yeah, the refresh on line 31371 can probably just go?
It seems like nothing should be pausing between there and the good one
Also, make it `(rCLEAR|rALL)` instead
to ensure the bitmap clears properly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:35

also in load_quest..

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:36

?
what about load_quest?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:36

and again in `if(!load_last_timed_save)`
all these refresh call before setting the map to what was last loaded in history

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:37

ah, I see
....to be fair, that has kinda annoyed me a bunch in general
(you can absolutely see that when it's loading quests, some popups happen between those....)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:38

it's probably done for a reason in some parts...
idk
oh my. i removed those refresh calls and now...
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1071573415040921610/1071666174611427328/image.png?ex=65e40ce6&is=65d197e6&hm=0c2b1613136e176e16059b7b98f2b8137801f84cbe30a92b6524079a1e8e76b9&)
well, that explains what we saw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:39

huh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:39

clip?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:39

well nothing clips the `menu1` bitmap....
maybe the `screen` bitmap?
....doesn't look like it
hmmm
What happens if you hit `B` to reset the transparency table?
(and say yes)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:41

it's fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:41

what was it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:42

oh, I mean hitting B fixed it
so what did that do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:42

oh
that just called `refresh(rALL)` again

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:42

mhm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:42

so, that first time it's rendering is off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:44

Try putting `reload_zq_gui()` instead of `refresh(rALL)` at the point that is refreshing wrong
that function will reload all fonts, reload the entire GUI structure, and re-generate several of the main bitmaps, and then call `refresh(rCLEAR|rALL)`
so, I would expect that to be a "hard reset" of whatever is going on

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:46

uh ok so I've done that just after `Map.setCurrMap(zinit.last_map);` in the main fn (replacing `refresh(rALL);`) and it worked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:46

OK then
....huh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:46

even better, i just removed that too
still ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:46

?
what??

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:46

so refresh(all) being called too soon was bad?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:46

guess so
The odd thing is
`load_size_poses()` (which does all the bitmap regeneration and stuff)
....is called like 1k lines above that point
so, everything should be properly loaded and generated for the proper resolution
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "so refresh(all) being called…"): ....does it work just under the `quit=!update_dialog(player2);` line?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:51

menu1 does have a clip

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:51

....where?
It has a bunch that are *only in small mode*

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:51

i dunno, i just see it in the debugger

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:51


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1071573415040921610/1071669482034049075/image.png?ex=65e40ffb&is=65d19afb&hm=2258a38b2bf3885a8b8bffb0f9cbbdeb2b3f69ecfc7de49160d6c66bbf2e2fbc&)
This would be the only one that would run
....which, that's the entire size of the bitmap
`zq_screen_w` and `zq_screen_h` should be their correct values by that point, as `load_size_poses()` should have been called over 1k lines earlier in main

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:52


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1071573415040921610/1071669738519937114/image.png?ex=65e41038&is=65d19b38&hm=3ea278af8fea4159a76156e2f808f17221635a668f5529023e301107b294fb79&)
hehe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:53

`zq_screen_w` and `zq_screen_h` are what at that point?
If the answer is not `912` and `684`, I'll be mad

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:55

no, that's what it is...
and that's what the menu1 clip is set to...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:55

then that should be the full bitmap size
and shouldn't be doing anything wrong
...could safely put that behind an `if(!is_large)`, for the record
and see if that fixes it
though I would hope it wouldn't, because that would be fucking weird

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 05:57

no change, so unrelated

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 05:57

ahk, as I thought
What's `screen`'s clip rect at the problem point?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 06:02

800x600 clip on screen
sus

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 06:09

*how*
Nothing in the source should be 800x600 anymore
I fucking ctrl+F'd for every single `800` and `600` literal in the entire source and checked every one

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 06:09

`InfoDialog`...
screen->w,h
(it calls `new_text_proc`)
wait one sec
not that one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 06:10

that's not the main screen, yeah
it's a temp bitmap that was swapped into the screen var

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 06:11

ok _rips hair out_

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 06:11

`box_out` also sets that clip rect
should be set to `set_clip_rect(screen, 0, 0, screen->w-1, screen->h-1);` by the time the function returns, though
`EditBoxView.cpp` also has a `set_clip_rect(screen, 0, 0,screen->w,screen->h);`
....`screen->w` and `screen->h` should not be 800,600 though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 06:17

unrelated but this is weird
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1071573415040921610/1071675951781527633/image.png?ex=65e41601&is=65d1a101&hm=6cd4f5e3c1a319f495f4c50cf16d9304b663e74e9b1ca9ddc7fe090860d05046&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 06:17

yeah.... a bit
`drawpanel` looks like absolute cursed bullshit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 06:18

rAll -> drawmenu (rMenu) -> rSCRMAP

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 06:18

It doesn't make sense in the `rALL` case
but in a `refresh(rMENU)` case, it might?
🤷‍♀️ weird shit
I touched as little as I could, so, left that alone

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 06:36

found the issue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 06:37

`set_clip_rect` in `init_dialog` uses SCREEN_W/H for setting the clip on the screen bitmap (seems like it should just _clear_ the clip?!), but that is no good because that now actually resolves to the actual window height/width.
needs to be screen->w,h
(or just clear clip...)
I suppose I only saw this easily on mac was because right now mac windows always open way too tiny
so, the initial window size was being used to set the screen clip

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 06:38

ah, the problem only occurs after you scale the window
which, the default resolution is pretty much the height of my monitor- thus why I wasn't reproducing it, as I can't scale up any more

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 06:40


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1071573415040921610/1071681733898010644/image.png?ex=65e41b64&is=65d1a664&hm=a867eb23d63f2fe89ac2be2d5061af3c0ec7f2bb71252d92e9df3245134bcbfe&)
684+taskbar+titlebar is just about 768
(very glad everything I needed to add fit with 684, or compact mode was gonna likely need to be scrapped, as I wasn't going to increase it to the point it wouldn't fit my monitor lol)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 06:42

does this change also seem ok? removed that early refresh call; and made load_quest set the map to whatever is in initdata...

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "(or just clear clip...)"): For the record, clearing the clip (`set_clip_rect(bmp,0,0,0,0)` or `set_clip_state(bmp,false)`) causes anything that would draw outside of the bitmap area to corrupt memory

 *  If x1, y1, x2 and y2 are all zero
 *  clipping will be turned off, which will slightly speed up drawing
 *  operations but will allow memory to be corrupted if you attempt to draw
 *  off the edge of the bitmap.```

....I'm adding a function in `util.cpp` called `clear_clip_rect`, which sets the clip rect to the full bitmap size- which is the default for all new bitmaps anyway
