Creating a thread here to pin for missing help text (`?` buttons) anywhere where it seems like they could be useful. (Either there not being a button, or the help text being confusing/misleading/missing info/etc, are all good reasons to post it here)

Individual messages will be marked complete with a ✅ reaction, and cleared after a while.

On this dialog, some static text warning that "Enhanced Music must be in the same folder as the executables or quest to play" should be added. OR a popup that says this when a file in an invalid directory is chosen. Currently an invalid file just fails to populate the enhanced music filename field.

In regards to the discussion on "Block All" triggers here:  https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1201536185353392198/1201682551803219988

"These Block All/Weapon combos are now defunct due to the existence of Combo Trigger attributes. Examine the contents of the [Triggers] tab, the [Effects] subtab, and the "Weapon" box, using the "Kill Triggering Weapon" checkbox, and the "Trigger Handling" box's checkboxes.

"Tip: Hold ALT while clicking on a secret combo to assign the currently selected combo to it"

Static text or question mark button, whichever is easier.

(replying to @ Majora ""Tip: Hold ALT while clicking…"): old gui, needs full rewrite

=== @ P-Tux7 02/05/2024 22:36

Environmental enemy tooltip rewrite suggestions:
Fish "1x Zora (Enemy ID #33)"
Corner Traps "4x Traps (4-Way) (Enemy ID #47) in corners"
Middle Traps "2x Trap (4-Way) (Enemy ID #47) in the middle"
Falling Rocks "3x Rock (Enemy ID #34)"
Shooting Statues "Shooters (Fireball) (Enemy ID #83) are placed on top of each Statue combo"

=== @ P-Tux7 02/05/2024 22:37

Room Type Zelda help text rewrite suggestion: "Four instances of Fire (Enemy ID #85) appear on screen in front of the Guy. (That's all it does.)"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2024 22:51

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Environmental enemy tooltip r…"): ? that uses `Zora` again...
also it's not a hardcoded enemy id
it's based on an enemy editor flag
on the enemy

=== @ P-Tux7 02/05/2024 22:52

oh derp i forgot, thanks
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "? that uses `Zora` again..."): it does currently say Zora, unless that's reading from the name of the enemy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2024 23:05

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "it does currently say Zora, u…"): that in the tooltip is reading the enemy name from the enemy editor
which is much easier to do in a popup than in the main dialog, to be clear

Never anything wrong with circling things in red within MSPaint before sending the screenshot off to here.
Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, and Ctrl-V still work marvelously in MSPaint and direct to here.  It's fantastic.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2024 20:07

(or Win+Shift+S to snip it, which gives you a doodling tool directly)
