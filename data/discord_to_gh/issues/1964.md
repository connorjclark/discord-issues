Shows this with the upcoming Glenn the Great battle, with a 1x2 enemy as an example.

Fudge, re-record it later
Wrong setting in OBS

Sorry about the wait on this, we had other pressing bugs that were more ciritical
But here is the evidence needed:

And the quest in question

If you need anything more let me know.  I don't think it's critical, but it's certainly unpleasant with such a strong boss

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/19/2022 10:25

you give combo information, but not enemy info?
how is this enemy set up
(too tired to dig through a quest file at the moment)

=== @ NightmareJames 10/19/2022 10:44

I'll post it when I get home

Glenn is essentially a Death Knight in beta:  When I get refinement he will teleport on halt (but not right now)

...shit. And it's not scripted in any way?
uhg

heeelp deedee

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/19/2022 22:07

uhhhhhh
You're the one who did large enemy solidity! I wouldn't have touched it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/19/2022 22:15

But I have no fucking clue what I'm doing with enemies and that code is shit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2022 23:05

(meta) thread name was changed: Large Enemies ignore solidity, even with rule unchecked

=== @ NightmareJames 11/13/2022 11:16

Glenn seems to be working much better
I'll test on others
Thank you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 11:17

....I didn't even look at this yet

=== @ NightmareJames 11/13/2022 11:17

It was reported in the latest nightly.........

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 11:18

there was another bug that was not this one that was reported that I did fix
I didn't look into this one at all

=== @ NightmareJames 11/13/2022 11:18

OK, just keep me informed then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 11:18

this is what was fixed
Note that I didn't say anything in this channel
if I fixed it, I'd have said something here

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/13/2022 19:42

Wait, but did that report *fix* the issues you were having?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 19:52

It would not have fixed walking through a solid
the change would only affect the screen edge
and would make you *able to walk through more*, not *less*

=== @ NightmareJames 11/13/2022 21:23

I'll test out Glenn and others in heavier detail tomorrow
