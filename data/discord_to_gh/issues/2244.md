In 2.10 and below, the way to have remote secrets was to have dmaps share a level number and a dungeon boss flag, and put the trigger enemy on the screen you wanted secrets to trigger remotely on. This did not play a secret sound effect in 2.10 (or in 2.50). It does as of alpha 112.

It might also be a case of the "No Secret Sound" screen flag being read wrongly. Are the screen(s) in question in that quest flagged with that?
I think since 2.50 changed it from a flag to being settable, you'll want to look for sound = 0 in 2.50 or open it in 2.10.

Don’t have a good way of opening it in 2.10. I could try making a test quest in 2.10 but man 2.10 does not like modern machines much

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "It might also be a case of th…"): Yep! So, what happened is, it set the sound to the secret SFX number if that flag was not set. But, uh, the default is now the secret sfx instead of 0, so, it's now always the secret sfx. Easy to fix, just need to make it set it to 0 if that flag is on.
