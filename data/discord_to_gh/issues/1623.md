Because I'm always sure that I want to close ZCL.  I really don't just sit there having second thoughts.  I promise.

If I do accidentally close ZCL and I still wanted to use it, I can just reopen it again.  Due to some fantastic coding, it opens -very- quickly.  Hat's off on that one.  Seriously.  

.. and if I can't reopen it, then that's a bug and a separate issue.  

I love the protectiveness that the new ZCL offers, but I'm just not sure if it really needs to ask us if we're sure if we want to close ZCL.

I agree.

ZCL doesnt really have that crucial of data to need a sanity check

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 05/17/2022 17:59

I will say, it might be odd for it to close immediately if you use `esc`
w/o a sanity check
but if it's that big of a deal, being able to use esc to close it couldbe its own option

Both Alt+F4 and Escape currently still ask if it's okay to exit.  

I feel so darn _protected_ right now.
I just had to check because I never really tried them in a way that I would remember what they did, specifically.
I have ZC 2.55 Alpha 106 on my office workstation.  _Don't tell anyone._

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 05/17/2022 18:01

If I had ZC on my work computer I wouldn't tell anyone either

We're all the tech guys back here.
In 2022, everyone is a tech guy.

"Really want to quit" Yes "Are you sure?" Yes "Are you absolutely positive you wanna quit this program?" Yes "So, you're bored already with this wonderful program and just wanna quit?" Yes "You wanna quit and go back to your sorry boring everyday life" Yes *finally exits*
