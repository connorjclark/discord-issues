Perhaps I'm misremembering how this used to work, but when I go into combo pool mode and start drawing, I thought it used to draw random combos from the pool. Currently it's drawing the selected combo from the normal combo table and only works with the fill tool.

Oh yeah it definitely did used to work the way I remember it. Even has a fancy animation when using the combo brush option

Do you know when it last worked?

Not a clue. I haven't been doing a lot of screen design recently
