So I'm not completely sure if this is a feature or bug, but when you select two or more tiles in the regular editor, and right click and select one tile from the screen, it still uses the same amount of tiles.

In the picture, I right clicked and selected the top right tile, but should it be selecting only the one-tile or all 9?

Or maybe you can make this into a feature? idk lol

God damnit, I fixed alt click but not the rclick menu?

I also didn't fix it on selecting a favorite combo, wow.
Should be fixed in all cases.
