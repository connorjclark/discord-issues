Accessing Screen->D[] with a constant value seems to be bugging out when compiled in the newest version.

Is JIT on or off? (Checkboxes in launcher)

Does the dmap have a dmap offset?
or wait you sent the quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/04/2023 00:48

wait I can't read

It definitely worked in the newest before I recompiled, but the original quest was 107 so basically useless for comparison. I don't know when it broke but I'd assume fairly recently because using Screen->D[] is very common

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/04/2023 00:54

I....
How did this function EVER WORK?
It's using literal random garbage as the D index
instead of the index you passed
*OH*
But that random garbage
*would previously have always happened to be the correct value*
until we did optimizations
because it was the last value pushed to the stack
and that left the correct value, coincidentally, in the correct register....
`Game->GetDMapScreenD()` *NEVER* should have worked

aaaand looks fixed
