So @ DeletedUser just ran a stream earlier this morning on Prototype 6F to test out the new DoS party system on 1st Quest one more time. It was a relatively bug-free run, but I made a suggestion after the run that maybe the quest timer on the passive subscreen should be made visible at all times, so that no one needs to pull down the subscreen just to see their time, which itself wastes time. üòõ

Problem is, James had difficulty getting it to work, which I found odd, as I remember experimenting around with it in the past and successfully doing it.

After some experimentation with an old quest file of mine which *did* have it visible, I found the issue: there's a bug in ZC. üòÆ

So, in the subscreen editor, both the "Game Time" and the "Game Time (Quest Rule)" objects have three checkboxes in the Location tab of their properties: "Active Up", "Active Down", and "Active Scrolling", which respectively control whether the timer in question is visible when the active subscreen is up, down, or in the process of scrolling. The bug is that the (Quest Rule) variant actually disregards the "Active Down" checkbox, rendering said timer invisible on passive subscreens when the active subscreen is hidden from view.

I'm out now, will post verification when I get home

(replying to @ 4matsy "So @ DeletedUser just‚Ä¶"): Would "Active Down" not be the active subscreen being OPEN, as in, dropped down?
sounds like "Active Up" is the one you want

=== @ 4matsy 04/07/2022 13:55

It might actually be that way around, I haven't been able to check how the code goes.

dumbasses

=== @ NightmareJames 04/08/2022 03:13

:: sigh ::

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 03:17

should be fixed, though not gonna post a build yet because we are currently having worrying issues (re: #1518)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 03:18

(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìGame Time (Quest Rule) object not on passive subscreen
also, just for the record
it has nothing to do with the active checkboxes

=== @ NightmareJames 04/08/2022 03:19

Do we need to talk over voice chat?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 03:19

no it's fixed
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "should be fixed, though not g‚Ä¶"): ^

=== @ NightmareJames 04/08/2022 03:19

The worrying issues

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 03:19

oh
I don't know what voice chat with you would help
unless you have something to input about c++ std::strings behaving oddly

=== @ NightmareJames 04/08/2022 03:20

Well, wish you luck
TY again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/08/2022 04:48

@ DeletedUser #1518 has a pinned build that you can test this fix in

=== @ NightmareJames 04/09/2022 12:33

It's working, but maybe not in the way I'd prefer it to or expect it to
Address this later
Got bigger things on the table ATM

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/09/2022 13:00

??
It was not visible, now it should be visible
confused as to how it would be working `not in the way you'd prefer it to or expect it to`

=== @ NightmareJames 04/09/2022 13:25

It's like blinking when you transistion screens and not otherwise visible
It is there, but I don't think it's working "properly"
Videos and timestamps later, I am out

=== @ NightmareJames 04/09/2022 18:05

https://youtu.be/vLYV5dpgKQc  0:38 to 1:00, best example, all the way through though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/09/2022 18:10

wtf????????

=== @ NightmareJames 04/09/2022 18:16

I know, I'm like the same thing

=== @ NightmareJames 04/09/2022 18:18

Just for verification, if you need anything else let me know

Can confirm, the Game Time (Quest Rule version) is visible during screen transitions and otherwise hidden. The other Game Time subscreen object appears to function fine.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/10/2022 05:37

I don't even know why the quest rule version exists
until I just did something, it didn't appear AT ALL
now it is just not appearing during screens
like wtf

=== @ P-Tux7 04/11/2022 19:21

it also appears during death

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 19:24

Is it appearing a problem, or not appearing a problem @ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 04/11/2022 20:19

It SHOULD be appearing all the time, not just while scrolling or dying

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2022 20:24

Aye, ok, that's what we were working on here
It wasn't appearing AT ALL before my attempted fix
