I was thinking with the current shield, maybe a flag to make it active, then attributes and such for changing step speed (where 0 is standing still) and one for an extra PTM for the holding shield sprites (that way, to stack with the item's inherent PTM)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/28/2022 15:28

I...
You already posted this in another thread didn't you?
And uh, I already added it

=== @ vlamart 04/28/2022 15:56

Oh, I was just spit balling how it could work. Didn't know it was already done, dope!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/28/2022 16:18

didn't include a step speed thing, not sure how hard that would be

=== @ P-Tux7 04/28/2022 17:07

now that would be a neat script at least

=== @ Attempt 04/30/2022 02:37

that's what my shield script does actually

=== @ P-Tux7 05/03/2022 21:04

so how do these work in the newest alpha?
specifically regarding player speed while the shield is out
also, is there script access to the shield out state for things like the LA urchins?

=== @ vlamart 05/03/2022 21:06

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "specifically regarding player‚Ä¶"): I don't think it does that yet
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "also, is there script access‚Ä¶"): And I don't believe so. I had to use UsingItem(this->ID) recently

=== @ P-Tux7 05/03/2022 21:08

oh, at least that exists, good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/03/2022 21:08

I didn't add a step speed thing yet
and yeah, you just check if the button with the shield on it is being held

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 14:09

Sooooooooooooooooo

Smooth criminal

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 14:10

Of note: I also cleaned up some things that weren't quite polished with it
notably, I had set it so you can't attack while using the shield... but not that you can't use the shield while attacking?
so, uh, now it cares about `Action` for whether or not you can shield
`none`, `walking`, and `rafting` are valid
if rafting, it ignores the `Lock direction` flag, as that would prevent the raft from turning and get you stuck on every corner.
and raft speed is not affected either

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 14:13

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíActive Shield

=== @ vlamart 05/07/2022 14:33

Can't tell if bug, but if you keep multiple level active shields, the lower level shield (or maybe the shield with the lowest block value because I also tried this with two level 1 shields) doesn't work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 14:36

hmm
So, this doesn't really work like other active items do
shields are generally passive items, so a lot of their checks use the passive item check code
which uses the highest level shield
Gonna have to say 'not a bug, just a limitation'

=== @ vlamart 05/07/2022 14:56

That makes sense, because a similar thing happens with scripts. I used UsingItem() to draw something over Link when using the shield, the script works on the lower level shield, even though the shield item itself doesn't activate. And the script doesn't work on the higher level shield, even though the item does

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 15:03

aye, because the `UsingItem()` is getting the ID on the button, while the engine is getting the highest level shield
definitely feels like something I need to patch, but it will take a bit of rewriting to fix that

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/07/2022 17:35

ooh, fancy
"speed: a negative amount will do that much more damage"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 17:37

ah, crap, copypaste

=== @ P-Tux7 05/07/2022 19:07

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "`none`, `walking`, and `rafti‚Ä¶"): rafting is currently pointless for shielding outside of the mirror shield; you can't take damage while rafting so you have no need for shielding
at least last i checked

=== @ vlamart 05/07/2022 19:19

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "which uses the highest level‚Ä¶"): Will you look at this too for keeping multiple active shields?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 19:20

(replying to @ vlamart "Will you look at this too for‚Ä¶"): working right now
on that problem

=== @ vlamart 05/07/2022 19:23

Dope üç™

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 19:43

Boom, it works
If you use the 'inactive' feature of it, it will only use the highest level for that
but using the active, whatever one you are holding down is the one that it uses
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "rafting is currently pointles‚Ä¶"): so, what if someone wants to make a reason to use a mirror shield on a raft? <:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/07/2022 21:15

a rule to make you not invincible on the raft ü§î

=== @ vlamart 05/07/2022 21:20

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "a rule to make you not invinc‚Ä¶"): Raft item flag instead? (So say a L1 raft that hurts on lava, and L2 with invincibility as to not hurt when going on lava)

=== @ P-Tux7 05/07/2022 21:38

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "a rule to make you not invinc‚Ä¶"): i'd definitely have to suggest an option for better raft controls before that ever happens
