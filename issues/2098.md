Doesn't happen in the December 11th nightly; have not checked any more specific. Inputs are delayed by a frame; this is noticeable when using the f4 key to frame advance. possible culprit: https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/0b4929510fdc8200c050f9ed11309e89622a23b5 ?

I have zero idea if this is related or not, but since the F4-to-Pause key was mentioned, in last night's build of ZC, when I'm in a minigame in Panoply of Calatia, (And this __only__ happens there, so far. Not outside of one.)  pressing F4 to pause-scum the minigame immediately scrolls it down to a black screen. 

It literally _scrolls down_ extremely quickly to a totally black screen while it's paused.  F4 keeps it black.  F3 restores it to normal.

This doesn't happen in Base A111.

I don't know if it's its own bug or related to this, but I saw F4 so I jumped on the bandwagon.

Edit
Creating the separate report shortly'ish.
Keeping this here for separation of concept purposes I suppose.
