FFC's flash as 'overhead' when using the Quest rule - FFC's are visible while the screen is scrolling. They should not do that and only appear overhead if their FFC draw-over checkbox is filled. They do this when you use transparent shadow layer on layer 2. They are originally shadowed over when set on ground tiles, but briefly appear overhead when you scroll to the next screen over.
This is in Latest Alpha.

I use a transparent black shadow as a layer 2 in some dungeons which is why this is an issue.

Also on overworlds.
