If you use the Enemies->Secrets flag WITHOUT using Enemies->Secrets is Permanent, secrets no longer trigger. The secret sfx will play, but no combos flagged with secret flags actually change. It works correctly when Enemies->Secrets is Permanent is checked.
Not sure how this one happened, but it renders many quests unplayable and probably warrants a pretty quick fix

err, what??

what's the state of the flag at the bottom here?

=== @ Russ 05/14/2022 20:44

Unchecked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/14/2022 20:45

And, without the 'enemies->secret is perm' it doesn't trigger anything at all?

=== @ Russ 05/14/2022 20:45

Checking it fixes it
Correct
It will play the secret sound effect, but it doesn't actually trigger flags 16-31

so, `hidden_entrace()` here is the 'secret triggering function'
clearly something is wrong when `only16_31` is false.... but this was definitely working before...
Setting it to perm makes it trigger immediately, though?
because perm shouldn't affect that function at all....

=== @ Russ 05/14/2022 20:47

Setting "enemies->secret is permanent" causes secrets to correctly trigger when enemies die, yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/14/2022 20:47

that's weird as fuck
do you have a basic test quest?

=== @ Russ 05/14/2022 20:48

I can put one together real fast

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/14/2022 20:52

oh ffs
I see
there's another hardcoded check of those vars
that doesn't have the qr check

=== @ Russ 05/14/2022 20:52

Wonderful

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/14/2022 20:54

nice catch
my tests missed this
It also specifically affects flags 16-31
other flags would trigger properly

=== @ Russ 05/14/2022 20:55

Welp...
Glad I caught it
Was going mad looking at this screen that I _knew_ was working right
And it had some combo cycling shenanigans so I _thought_ I must've broken something there
