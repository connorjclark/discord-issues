Like I said in dev discussion,  I hope it's not too late to suggest/request a few things on the enemy sound side of things. I would like to suggest an optional "see/sight" sound for when an enemy first spawns, an "active" sound that plays at random intervals while the enemy is still alive and an "attack/projectile" sound that can overwrite the default sound effect for when a projectile is shot from an enemy. Kinda like how classic Doom does it.

(meta) thread name was changed: -See-, -Active- and -Attack- sounds for custom enemies

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 04:22

wait we don't have shot sounds?
that sounds important
also as said i thought all enemies already had the "boss roar" thing as you see in isle of rebirth
even darknuts can have one

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/21/2021 04:24

Yes but the boss roar is constant, without randomized periods of silence between them
ergo, it doesn't really count

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 04:26

hmm well in that case a QR or a checkbox for each enemy would certainly work
but it should still use the sound # field to conserve qst filesize

the point would be to have multiple different sounds for the same enemy
and the file size cost wouldn't be much, especially since SFX are `byte` sized

=== @ FireSeraphim 12/01/2021 19:53

any progress on this?

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/27/2022 15:28

I hate to ask again but it's seems relevant to me, especially since it seems like you guys are actively working on the enemy editor right now. But has there been any progress on this front?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/27/2022 21:53

Definitely agreed with the firing sound thing

=== @ FireSeraphim 07/22/2022 09:12

bump

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 09:22

```cpp
npc script customSounds
{
    void run(int spawnSound, int activeSound, int activeSoundMinInterval, int chance)
    {
        if(spawnSound) Audio->PlaySound(spawnSound);
        unless(activeSound) return;
        while(true)
        {
            Waitframes(activeSoundMinInterval);
            while(Rand(chance)) Waitframe();
            Audio->PlaySound(activeSound);
        }
    }
}```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 09:24

weapon sounds should be added in engine, that script would handle the other 2 easily
