so
does that combo use CSet2 at all
because if not, this is correct
(...really should probably actually be NAMED cset2, thanks zoria....)
but, combos literally do not HAVE a cset
(aside from the CSet2 stuff)
the cset of the combo on the screen, is part of the SCREEN (`Screen->ComboC[]`), and is thus not accessible as part of the combo

=== @ mitchfork 01/31/2024 03:22

gah
seems like it's been undocumented anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 03:23

oh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 03:23

Can we deperecate ->Cset?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 03:23

we already did

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 03:23

I see there is already ->cset2

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 03:23

or well
it's not marked as actually deprecated

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 03:23

I don't see it marked deprecated in the combo table

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 03:23

probably should be

(replying to @ mitchfork "seems like it's been undocume…"): but yep, this was a Zoria-ism
naming it CSet even though it was the CSet2 and that's a confusing naming choice
combos simply don't have a cset to read
`Game->LoadTempScreen(this->Layer)->ComboC[this->Pos]` would do what you want

=== @ mitchfork 01/31/2024 03:24

Yeah, I think this is a case where - I used this in an old script, but didn't notice the bug because the tiles it was working with were 8-bit. I go to use that script with different tiles and notice this, but since those things it's been undocumented
easy enough to do that yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 03:28

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) are you marking it deprecated? if not I'll handle it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 03:28

you can handle it yeah
while we're talking about deprecation, just gonna mention @ mitchfork; you can turn on warnings/errors when using deprecated stuff in the compiler settings
which will basically yell at you when there's stuff you can update in your scripts
`#option WARN_DEPRECATED error` or `#option WARN_DEPRECATED warn` should work to enable this for only a specific section of a script

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 03:30

can we somehow get that to ignore files inside include folders?

=== @ mitchfork 01/31/2024 03:31

it does give me a few std_functions warnings, yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 03:31

the way c++ compilers work is that you can do...i think it's `-system-include=`?... and all warnings in there are ignored / never printed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 03:31

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "can we somehow get that to ig…"): I mean, not really
keeping in mind people use include folders for reasons other than that as well though, and may have their *own source* in an include folder...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 03:31

such that you only get warnings for code you authored, not 3p or the std lib

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 03:31

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "such that you only get warnin…"): this is basically...
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "`#option WARN_DEPRECATED erro…"): ....what this is for
you can enable it for a specific scope
heck
you could create a `includes.zs` file that has all your third party includes in it
and then `#option WARN_DEPRECATED off` in that file
that would do exactly what you are suggesting, right now, as is
(and works for all `#option`s, not just this one)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/31/2024 03:33

it's not ideal, it being a compiler option you have to wire into source code, but it's at least possible so 👍

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 03:33

(file-level `#option`s are inherited by files included from that, so long as their option value is `inherit` for that property, which is the default value of all options)
(manually setting the value to `default` for a file forces that file to use ZQ's setting)
(and obviously setting it yourself sets it to what you set it to0
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "it's not ideal, it being a co…"): `std_zh` already uses this for several options, as well
it feels, as far as I understand, somewhat similar to `#pragma` stuff

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1202091153965719573/1202094774295728139/image.png?ex=65e7e480&is=65d56f80&hm=841e2f145d96c2cf6a6077ba34256ffef011acdb7031bf5c0a5a16524b8b8055&)
but yeah `std.zh` sets these, and then includes all the other std files, thus letting them inherit these options instead of the user's settings

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/31/2024 05:42

wouldn't it be better to just make it grab it's cset? It's not like combodata doesn't have this-> only pointer (Pos for example)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/31/2024 05:43

Better, yes
breaks old scripts, also yes
because zoria already used that var name
