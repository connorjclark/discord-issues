The boss Dodongo usually can be stunned by bomb smoke and then killed with the sword. It didnt seem to work in the Zelda Remake Quest.

it should
what version are you using?

255
1st Remake

I just went into another room with 3 dodongos and there it worked. Maybe I just missed the monster? I thought I had hit it though.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 20:38

what build

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:39

It was the boss from level 2 where I thought it hadnt worked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 20:39

screenshot the `ZC->About` menu

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:40

255  61

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:41

But now that I stunned the dodongos in the other room successfully Im in doubt if I just missed him earlier.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 20:43

Alpha 61?
That's over a year old

It says the version is from yesterday

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 20:48

(replying to @ Kampy "255  61"): ?
I asked for a screenshot for a reason

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:50

What more do you need? It is Version 255 Build 61 built yesterday by you.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 20:50

Alpha number is usually important

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:50

100

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 20:51

and is usually the most important number
so not giving that
meant I had no idea what you were talking about
Anyway
you need to hit the front of the dodongo

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:51

You asked for the Build number not the Alpha number.  üòõ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 20:52

I asked what build
build means all of the information

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:52

Anyway, I think you can hit him from the side in the original though I dont remember exactly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 20:54

@ naturesucks ?

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:54

Yes, thats it
I just fought them again
You cant hit them from the sides
Thats the error
Like side of the face should work

=== @ tim 12/21/2021 20:55

pretty sure side is expected behavior

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:56

I landed a perfect hit and it didnt register. So now Im sure it is different.

=== @ tim 12/21/2021 20:56

1st remake is what
the one packaged with zc?

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:57

It is called like that. I dont know if it is made by you.

darkflamewolf's remake, noted

=== @ P-Tux7 12/21/2021 21:03

oh yeah i wanted to report this a few days ago but forgot
the hitbox to smoke a dodongo DOES seem easier/more lenient to do on nes

=== @ P-Tux7 12/21/2021 21:43

i'll test just how far later

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 08:59

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùìDodongo doesnt like smoke
