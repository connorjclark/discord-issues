This is a laundry list of smaller issues I've encountered when using the new subscreen editor. Most of these I can probably tackle myself.
- The C/V hotkeys are mapped to paste properties instead of paste new, which is vastly less useful. It also only copies one widget at a time, not allowing multiple to be saved to the clipboard. Thinking for copying shared UI elements between pages.
- The Duplicate Widget option which does work for groups of widgets does not select the newly created widgets after creating them, making it easy to lose track of them
- When selecting a group of widgets with shift+click, it will not deselect a widget if it's the last selected in the group
- Overridden selector X/Y are relative to the subscreen rather than the widget itself. This makes it more tedious when mass copying widgets with overridden selectors and is rarely useful. I think this should range from -127 to 128 and be relative to the widget, with a compat QR for the old behavior.
- Page change transitions should have an argument for updating the selector position on the new page
- Text widgets default to having a background color when the user rarely ever wants one
- "Clear Selection" is indicated as having the "C" hotkey when it does copy instead
- Add to Selection and Remove from Selection appear to do nothing? Unsure how these could ever work when the way the subscreen works there's always at least one object selected
- I am unclear on the difference between "Paste Properties" and "Paste All"
- There is as far as I'm aware not a way to set the selector position aside from the arrow buttons. Perhaps a right click option for "Set Default Selection"?

(replying to @ Moosh "This is a laundry list of sma…"): - I think Shift+V or Ctrl+V or something does Paste New?
- You can feel free to add a checkbox for if the overridden selector is relative or absolute, that seems worthwhile
- transitions should have a target selector yeah
- `Paste Properties` will not paste every property; ex. won't paste the `Container` of a gauge. `Paste All` pastes every property.
- ...Is the position set by the arrow buttons actually used as a default starting position? If so, that was accidental, and cool, and definitely should have an rclick option

It appears to be used as the starting position. Was very confused why it was defaulting to my page tabs in test play until I fiddled with it in the editor

Not getting paste new with shift+v or ctrl+v. Can definitely make that a hotkey for paste properties though

for the record
everything to do with "selections" is janky jank jankjankfuckjankfuck

=== @ Moosh 10/16/2023 03:46

yeahhh

I barely changed how that shit works at all
so it's just how it's always done it
Since that's a ZQ only thing, feel free to tear it out and rewrite it if you like

I messed with it very briefly when getting wizards to select things properly and did not seem like fun
