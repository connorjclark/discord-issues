Basically a trigger combo flag for the Quake Hammer scroll. Would make sense since the inspiration for this ability is Four Swords Adventures. Would this be possible?

=== @ vlamart 03/16/2023 07:29

Would it trigger only the combo directly hit, a radius, or the whole screen?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2023 07:36

I would assume the stun radius

=== @ Alucard648 03/16/2023 08:27

This trigger ahould have 2 settings - trigger radius and min damage.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2023 08:27

err?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2023 08:36

anyway

there we go, cleaned up rounding errors

This is the same radius the quake hammer stuns enemies in

I have it applying the `Min Level (Applies to all)` value to the *hammer* level, not the *scroll* level, for the record

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2023 09:12

also I made various dropdowns for SFX actual dropdowns instead of textfields

And you'll notice that the quake hammer scroll (and super quake, and spin, and hurricane spin) all now have a "Charge Sound" option (defaulted properly for old quests)

Also, see #2212

=== @ Shane 03/16/2023 09:42

oooh üíô

=== @ P-Tux7 04/03/2023 02:25

so, how does this work exactly? is there a new "quake" LWeapon?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 02:25

No
when the quake hammer is used, it stuns enemies in a radius
When it does this, it triggers this trigger in that same radius

=== @ P-Tux7 04/03/2023 02:27

oh so it just checks the objects in the quake radius, yeah?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 02:28

yeah, it checks every combo in the radius for the trigger flag
and ffcs
....and by "checks every combo in the radius"
I mean it checks the `distance()` from the combo to Link's position for every combo on screen
and it then checks any of those closer than the radius for the trigger flag.
Yes, it's centered on Link, not the hammer weapon. I don't know why.
