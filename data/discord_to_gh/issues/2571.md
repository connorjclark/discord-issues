This would put two more fields in the custom guy settings, Animation Frames and Animation Speed. I got the idea from trying to set a guy to look like a wallmaster. It would look cooler if it were animated.

Do note that guys are enemies in the backend, and enemies do not have this as a thing yet.
If it were easy to do this I would have lol
