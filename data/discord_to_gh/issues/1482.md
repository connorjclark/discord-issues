Does what the Z1 Ring (Health Divisor Ring) does but for magic.
Flags:
-Use Fractional Divisor
-Divides Non-Item Magic Drains (i.e. Magic Drain touch effects on enemies. Draining 64 MP Effect Strength would now only drain 32 if you had a 1/2 magic ring with this checked, like a Z1 Ring with hearts.)

what about any counter divisor rings

doing generic things for counter doesn't really work for items
because of the way items work
only the highest level counter ring would work
so if you gave multiple for different counters
only one would work
unless we implemented it in an entirely different way to other items

Do I sense like 30 different itemclasses for counter rings coming?

ehh
if you're using the Custom counters, you're likely using scripts anyways
so that leaves us with Magic, Bombs, Super Bombs, Arrows, Anywhere Keys, Level Keys, and Rupees/Health (when used to fuel an item). many of which are... incredibly niche either don't often use more than one at a time (so a divisor is useless) or are barely used as costs at all
and because magic is a much more versatile counter than the others it obviously should get first dibs

i can name one quest where hearts are used as ammo, one where multiple rupees fuel the goddess spells, and *none* where the "multiple key cost" feature added to lockblocks is used
compare that to magic
