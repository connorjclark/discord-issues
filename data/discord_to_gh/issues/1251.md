I'm pretty sure I reported this back in another thread, but it should probably have its own so it doesn't go forgotten. This pretty much defeats the purpose of the popup currently, not that it really affects me any

I am so confused why this is a problem

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:30

You and me both. I swear for a little bit when it was added it was working as intended.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:31

.....oh
You know what the fuck is wrong with it?
Here's the ZASM command struct:```cpp
struct ffscript
{
    word command;
    int32_t arg1;
    int32_t arg2;
    char *ptr;
};```
(the ptr is unused)
but uh
the interesting thing?\
`arg1` and `arg2` are not ever initialized unless they are used
....so they are random memory values, which might "change", and it's detecting THOSE changes.....

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:32

ahh
well that sounds like a headache and a half

Theoretically adding a `clear()` function should help
and then calling that on every instance during scripts_data initalization SHOULD work?

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:36

Wait aren't arg1 and arg2 fields in the FFC editor? Why would they be initializing to random memory and not that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:36

no, no
this isn't that at all
this is ZASM Opcodes

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:36

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:36

when you have like
`PUSHV 10`

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:37

gotcha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:37

that sets `command` to the value for `PUSHV`
and `arg1` to `100000`
....but wouldn't initialize `arg2`, since it doesn't use that.....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:39

@ Moosh see if this fixes it?

(Don't save any important projects in this without backup, not sure about stability, this is on switchhook branch)

Appears to be working

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2021 09:43

woo, that's really good

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2021 09:43

Glad this one's sorted üôÇ
