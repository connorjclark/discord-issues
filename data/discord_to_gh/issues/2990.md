A way to "undo" having followed a Tile or Side warp to its destination, so you can immediately go back to the screen you were looking at that had that warp destination you just followed.

Surprisingly useful.

Why don't you try right clicking and clicking `Warp Back`?

Aww nuts, you're six steps ahead of me as always.  Well done. ❤️
