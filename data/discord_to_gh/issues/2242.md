We used to be able to preview dark room instantly by pressing L.  We can't anymore, Zquest just locks up indefinitely until I pres Esc key and ZQuest resumes normally not being able to preview dark room.

Works fine for me, in both compact and expanded mode?

Hmmmm,  It's not freezing as I thought.  It just won't preview dark for me in both expanded and compact.

Do you have the new dark rooms QR enabled?

=== @ cbailey78 03/17/2023 16:19

Nope.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2023 16:20

then that would do it
that preview feature is only for new dark rooms

=== @ cbailey78 03/17/2023 16:21

I'm talking about the classic old school dark room preview palette wise.
via pressing L

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2023 16:21

Pressing L to preview is only for new dark rooms
I would know, as I added that feature myself, and I never made it work for classic old school dark rooms
(old school dark rooms are palette nightmares...)
If you want L to preview them, that would be a feature request, not a bug report.

=== @ cbailey78 03/17/2023 16:23

A feature that we used to have

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2023 16:24

In what version?

=== @ cbailey78 03/17/2023 16:24

Latest nightly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2023 16:25

no, like, when are you saying 'we used to have' it

=== @ cbailey78 03/17/2023 16:25

Oh, I don't really know what the last version that worked until now.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2023 16:25

I don't recall such a thing existing

=== @ cbailey78 03/17/2023 16:26

I think before when A5 was introduced, we would preview dark room palette wise.
Like in 2.50 for example

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2023 16:27

...ah, nevermind, so it did
my apologies

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/17/2023 16:30

ah, I see what's wrong! should be an easy fix, hopefully?
Yep, fixed!

=== @ cbailey78 03/17/2023 16:31

RIGHT ON!

=== @ cbailey78 03/17/2023 16:33

It's nice to have RAID fogger to fix bugs!
