Pretty straightforward. If there's an enemy with SFX on the screen, it stays silent after the subscreen is closed. If a new instance is spawned afterwards, it starts up again. Similar thing happened with potions in 7th so hopefully the same fix can be applied here

Convenient time for me to catch this as generic scripts may have the same issue

Does this issue happen with screen`s ambient SFX (that ocean ambience in official quests)?

(replying to @ Alucard648 "Does this issue happen with s…"): Yes it does.

Generic scripts don't seem to kill the sounds at all. Tried doing it myself, but n->StopBGSFX() doesn't stop it. Neither does n->Remove()

Does writing 0 into Screen->OceanSFX terminate ambient sound immediately, if preceeded by Game->EndSound(Screen->OceanSFX)?
