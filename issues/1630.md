I was just trying to set up a Signpost that uses the room's String as its string.  I hit 's' to set the room's string to string #1, then hit "done."  But it didn't work in-game.

Then I went into the Room Data pane and was able to set the string there, and that worked fine.

This isn't a bug.  This is just idiot-proofing the Strings pane to not look like we're setting the **room's** string rather than editing any string. 

This would only affect the "s" window's header bar that says "Edit Message string"  to turn it into "Edit Message strings"  That's all.

The only reason this is happening is because we used to assign strings to a room with "s" but now it brings up the Strings editor, which is good.

I... am confused as to how you thought the string editor was assigning a single room's string, and doubt a single `s` in a title would make that much of a difference....
but, on the other hand, changing 1 letter is such a small level of work, that there's no reason NOT to do it....

Like I said:  It's just idiot-proofing it.  I volunteered to be that idiot when I started using the program.
If there's an idiot trap I can fall into, I'm pretty good at finding them.
Thanks for the change.  üëç
