The thing where you can drag a selection in the combo panel to change your combo brush size; some people expressed annoyance at this so having a toggle off for it would be good

(..would make sense to add it to the rclick menu *on the combo pane* though I guess)
but, already exists

huh
could maybe also add it to options
just so it's easier to find

and/or a hotkey

I need to rework the whole hotkey system again soon anyway
I want to redo favorite commands
and merge them with the hotkey system
so you can have a hotkey for any favorite command, and a favorite command for anything you can hotkey
....and add a damn searchbar to the hotkey dialog
