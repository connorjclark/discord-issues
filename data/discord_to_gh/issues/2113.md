Just something I've been noticing today on the newest nightly. Whenever I click in or out of the window, there's a noticeable stutter where Windows freezes for a second. The mouse stops responding and any video I have playing in the background freezes up as well. Task Manager doesn't show any unusual spikes when it happens, but something screwy is nonetheless happening. Both ZC and ZQuest do this but no other program seems to. Anyone else experiencing this?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2023 21:16

Haven't seen this. Can you try some more nightlies and find where it first happens for you?

=== @ Moosh 01/01/2023 21:21

Will do. It's possible this is something windows has messed up, as I can recall experiencing similar behavior when working on paldata but less severe. I figured at the time that it was a side effect of debug builds

=== @ Moosh 01/01/2023 21:24

Yeah I'm getting it on alpha 108 but not 107. I'm certain it wasn't doing anything this intrusive before though.

=== @ Moosh 01/01/2023 21:25

Aware this is incredibly unhelpful information of course üò¶

=== @ Moosh 01/01/2023 21:42

Okay seems this is the exact build where it started happening. The one that introduced window scaling.

Sorry once again for reporting issues that seemingly only affect me and apparently stretch that far back :/

=== @ Moosh 01/05/2023 03:34

~~Unsure if it was intentional but this seems to have been fixed. ZQuest is running much smoother as of 2023-01-05.~~
nvm, spoke too soon. Seems to happen at the whims of windows :/

A little more on this, it seems to not happen with ZQuest when using OpenGL as the graphics driver. Unfortunately that option isn't available for ZC
I went to record a video of the bug in progress but amusingly enough, just having OBS idling in the background seems to fix it. As soon as OBS is closed it returns

=== @ Moosh 01/11/2023 01:22

I think I recall this happened in the past with another ZC performance bug. Some people couldn't get 60 FPS but opening OBS made it work again

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/11/2023 01:35

If you set the graphics driver directly in cfg it fixes for ZC?

=== @ Moosh 01/11/2023 01:39

Good question. I wasn't aware there was a setting for ZC, thought using it caused crashes

=== @ Moosh 01/11/2023 01:42

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "If you set the graphics drive‚Ä¶"): But yeah, this does appear to fix it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/11/2023 01:43

(replying to @ Moosh "Good question. I wasn't aware‚Ä¶"): That would have been before the recent rendering refactor

=== @ Moosh 01/11/2023 01:44

Gotcha. So it is safe now and the launcher just hasn't been updated to include it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/11/2023 01:44

So some crappy behavior from directx backend. Sigh

=== @ Moosh 01/11/2023 01:45

Good that I seemingly have a fix now though. Was really getting on my nerves testing my server with two instances and having it freeze up every time I swapped windows
