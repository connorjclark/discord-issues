A setting that stores the current combo placement CSet in memory for tile/combo pages and automatically sets the preview CSet in the tile/combo pages to that CSet whenever you open one.

Life-changing stuff right there.
You're referring to not having to start at combo 0 and cset 0 whenever you select a secret combo or door combo or something?

Right

ctrl+click?
for most of them at least

=== @ P-Tux7 01/23/2024 20:36

oh, thanks

It certainly won't work for the Secret Combo pane though.  That just brings up the inherent flag.
And that's one of the areas where it's needed most.
... whaaat.  Ctrl-__Right__click on a combo also brings up the inherent flag thing too.  I had no idea.  .. and no idea why it does.  But, neat.  Useless, but interesting.
What I wouldn't give for a "Make all of these into this specific combo" button in the secret pane, but that's a separate suggestion.  Oddly related though.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "ctrl+click?"): Wait, were you __suggesting__ a ctrl-click as the recommended key that would do this behavior, or were you asking us to try ctrl-clicking on things because that would simulate the desired behavior of this request?
Because I'm experimenting around to see what ctrl-clicking works in, and for the necessary elements, it's not a lot so far.
Works great in the Combo Alias "I'm making a new 2x2 Tree Alias and I want to make the other half of the tree trunk" sort of thing though.
If only it would say Ctrl-Clicking is an option in the top half of the pane.

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Because I'm experimenting aro‚Ä¶"): I just made it work for at least door combo set stuff
the fix for which was in shared code, so figured it might've fixed it in some other spots

Like, just __now__ or within the past few months?
Definitely useful for door combo set stuff.  üëç  Thank ye.
