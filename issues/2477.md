test quest please
(this is a bit annoying of a thing to test without one lol, lot of setup)

=== @ Zaxarone 06/27/2023 11:00

fair, give me a second

=== @ Zaxarone 06/27/2023 11:02

might have to cheat in bombs with B but here it is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 11:57

there's some sort of script fucking with it
breakpoint hit in `ffscript.cpp` for `LWPNZ`, so you're modifying it's Z value at least
....and just hit `LWPNY`
so yeah, you have a script moving the bomb
@ Zaxarone
(For the record, it is not the item script on the bracelet, I disabled that before testing)

=== @ Zaxarone 06/27/2023 11:59

ah ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 11:59

the engine movement looked to be using the right numbers
and then the script just sets the position to some fuckall value and makes it fly straight up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:01

(if you send the scripts I might be able to find it)

=== @ Zaxarone 06/27/2023 12:02

i have  a lot of scripts lol
but i did recently reorganize  them.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:02

oh wait actually
one moment
I'm stupid
I can just figure out what slot it's in from the debugger

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:03

type 1 slot 1
..so, global active
makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:05

there's `lweapon->isValid()` called somewhere nearby to the issue

searched in my  global

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:06

well
it won't be
`lweapon`
it'll be whatever
the lweapon variable is named
so like
```cpp
lweapon weap;
weap->isValid()```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:08

just search for `->isValid()` and ignore any that aren't lweapon related

=== @ Zaxarone 06/27/2023 12:10

fixed  it! thanks, and i know this wasnt a zc bug but thanks for helping  me!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:10

no problem ❤️
What was the issue, if I may ask?

=== @ Zaxarone 06/27/2023 12:11

the bomb throwing in my global. i just  commented out the `bomb();` inn the loop and it fixed it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:11

oh, you had a throwing script lol?
that'd do it XD

=== @ Zaxarone 06/27/2023 12:12

yeah i thought removing it from the item itself would fix it, but nope, had to cut it out of the global

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:13

❤️ glad that's working now
