A tab in the Enemy Editor for the various sounds the enemy makes

The essentials:
-Ambient sound (Z1 bosses)
-Shooting sound
-Hit sound
-Death sound

Nice to have but unessential:
-Weapon sound B (used for blocking weapons in most cases, or for the explosion in the case of Lit Bomb/Lit Super Bomb)
-Reflected weapon sound
-Split sound
-Break shield sound
-Blocked weapon sound
-Heal sound (for the "Heal" weapon defense)
-Transform sound
-Stun sound
-Spawn sound

Enemy falling sound wouldn't be a bad one to add either - although would it be easy to implement, or is that dependent on the pitfall combo type itself?

Can I refer back to my earlier thread on this same exact subject? https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/900577849281503292
