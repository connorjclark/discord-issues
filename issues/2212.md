The four charge tiger scrolls (Spin Attack, Hurricane Spin, Quake Hammer, Super Quake) use their cost upon being charged. I dislike this because it means you can lose MP charging them only to be hit before you even use them.

My request is for a QR that only uses the cost upon the actual sword/hammer LWeapon spawning.

A note to users: Super Quake's cost will need to be rebalanced if you use this because it does not also add on the normal Quake Hammer cost when you use Super Quake, unlike how it does when cost is applied while charging.
