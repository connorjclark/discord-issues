I'm experiencing an issue where calling GetScreenState() is treating screen 3:00 as having been visited after visiting 2:80. I am only reading the state, never writing it, and using the default 2.53 Classic tileset, the one that's 1st Quest. The behavior is the same in 2.55.

here's a mostly unchanged default quest. Go to level 1, enter the passage, go to level 7, check the upper left of the spacebar map

Screen 00 and screen 80 are the same on two adjacent maps 🤦
I am so fed up with ZC right now I can't even

Is *that* why that bug happens?

...except wait, *visiting 0x80* is marking the next map's 0x00 as visited in-engine?
or is your script writing the visited state there for some reason?
because, the bug then is that ST_VISITED is being set for an 0x8\* screen

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...except wait, *visiting 0x8…"): this would explain a bug where screen 0 would be marked in the spacebar map
Like out of nowhere

=== @ Moosh 11/21/2021 00:05

Visiting 0x80 is marking the next map's 0x00, yes. The file I sent has no scripts, at least none I added

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2021 00:09

ok, yeah, that'd be an issue then
whatever code sets ST_VISITED needs to just not if `currscr > 0x7F`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 12:48

should be fixed

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒Potential ST_VISITED access overlap?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 23:16

Not actually fixed
just checked, it's still marking them for some reason

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 23:24

(assuming you're talking about what's been done before and you haven't just fixed it now, lemme rebuild)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 23:36

I just fixed it when I posted that

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 23:41

Okay yeah
tested it now, it is fixed
sorry for the heartattack

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 23:42

Too stoned to panick its all g
