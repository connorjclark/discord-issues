It would be nice to be able to specify whether or not a blocking combo allows for enemy weapons to pass through it while forbidding player weapons from doing so.

Check out the Block Weapon (Custom) combo

=== @ Phosphor 06/27/2023 00:08

I don't see any flags or attributes it other than specifying a blocking sound

? Buttons exist for a reason lol
(it uses the triggers tab)

=== @ Phosphor 06/27/2023 00:09

That's a weird way of going about it but alright

It might be weird
but would you rather have to do like
`1 = LWeapon Fire, 2 = LWeapon Arrow, 4 = Lweapon Bomb, ....` and add up the numbers for everything?
because that'd be what it would be to do it in combo attributes
(....it could be checkboxes in a combo wizard, but, this was added LONG before combo wizards existed)

=== @ Phosphor 06/27/2023 00:13

Yeah the combo wizard would be a lot more intuitive I'd say

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 00:14

yeah, the idea of combo wizards wasn't even a thought at that point though
it seemed much better to use the triggers tab so that weapons could just be checked off
`?` buttons give details in basically everywhere possible, so
do try to click them if you're having trouble with anything
