Bracelet option for proper lifting; either passive (on a button set in item properties) or active on an item button.

Needs code for handling a "held object", and plenty of shit to go along with. Been discussed for quite a while, but needs a thread.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/10/2021 21:01

is default link lifting done with a "bracelet 0"?
or can combos be set to have a bracelet level of 0 and they be pickupable
(-1 would be unpickupable though that would get into signed integers)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/10/2021 21:04

not a fucking clue
it's not going to be the bracelet class
because that's for pushing
(more than likely)
but no real plans here yet
thus the very very basic thread with almost no details

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2021 08:37

Basic idea: same as switchhook
general combo flag, allows any `Power Glove` item to lift it
if checked on a bush/slash/etc, it will break with it's standard effects
if checked on any random combo type, it will break with a misc sprite and a misc sfx, no further effects
and new combo type to add with lift level property, and highly configurable break properties

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2021 08:39

Large lifting is a bigger question
but, Zoria did large armos
sooo, clearly there's some reference on how to make it work
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) adding to thread

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/19/2021 10:33

note: attach `breakable` object type TO `weapon` object, on weapon destructor, set breakable to weapon's position, and add breakable to decorations list (clk=1)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/13/2022 21:48

so, did this a lot differently
Whole set of liftable data

just to update the thread
Now, what's left on my todo:
```
Add combo triggerflag for wThrown
Add std_constants constant for LW_THROWN, NPCD_THROWN, IC_LIFT_GLOVE, LA_LIFTING
GUI additions for edefTHROWN
Add to lift glove: Lift ZHeight, Lift Speed (change how it lifts, and where it throws from)
Add 'Lifting' combo editor tab to small mode... whoops
'lweapon Hero->HeldWeapon;', null by default, becomes weapon pointer for held weapon.
When doing any 'lweapon->' function, 'Hero->lift_wpn' must be checked in addition to the Lwpns sprite_list.
Assigning to 'Hero->HeldWeapon' should remove the given weapon from the Lwpns sprite_list, and give it to the 'Hero->lift_wpn' variable. Assigning null to it should work as a clearer. Remember to 'delete' the old lift_wpn. Also need a way to 'free' the weapon from being held?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/13/2022 23:19

what about lifted object graphic x/y offsets for hero script access

=== @ P-Tux7 09/13/2022 23:20

could be useful for scripting holding stuff in front of the player a la mario depending on player direction, i know alucard mentioned something about mario 3 and he works in sideview a lot
and also script access to what layer the held and thrown objects draw on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/13/2022 23:22

The lifted object is an actual weapon object
so, it's offsets... are the offsets of the weapon object
that's all in there
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "and also script access to wha…"): err, they are part of Link's sprite

=== @ P-Tux7 09/13/2022 23:24

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so, it's offsets... are the o…"): ah, great
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "err, they are part of Link's…"): ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/13/2022 23:24

you say "Script access to the layer it is on" as though that makes sense
but the object is drawn
as *part of Link's draw*
so, it draws to *IMMEDIATELY* above link

=== @ P-Tux7 09/13/2022 23:25

ohh
yeah i meant like if the scripter wanted it to draw behind link

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/13/2022 23:43

yeah no that doesn't work

=== @ P-Tux7 09/16/2022 22:16

Note: all picking up is disabled as a bunny in LTTP

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 23:01

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Note: all picking up is disab…"): so, simply don't set a lift glove as `Usable by Bunny`

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2022 23:02

ah, right, that, thanks

=== @ DergerSwerson 03/16/2023 05:52

is all of the stuff here finished?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2023 07:02

thanks for the prod, no it isn't

=== @ P-Tux7 03/16/2023 16:34

uhh hrm
is there a way to set the level of the thrown combo for triggering purposes?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2023 16:34

Level of the lift glove

=== @ P-Tux7 03/16/2023 16:34

maybe have the "level of gloves required" count as the level for - yeah
good, thanks
wait so um
would throwing a combo that requires a level 1 lift glove with a level 3 lift glove give it a level of 3

=== @ P-Tux7 03/16/2023 16:36

i feel as though the lift glove requirement level of the combo itself should be how much power it has (i.e. a bush should be less power than a stone), that's how it worked in LTTP
that'd be a neat QR
because i can see the argument for how the current way should work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2023 16:38

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "would throwing a combo that r…"): 3, it's just the item that created the weapon same as any other item

=== @ P-Tux7 03/16/2023 16:39

yeah, makes sense. i'm admittedly not sure how the combo would "talk" to the thrown weapon to assign it a level/power
are there any things assigned to the thrown object LWeapon by the combo right now besides the sprite and death sprite?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/16/2023 16:41

oh yeah, that reminds me
an option to have the thrown combo make clippings/decorations like a triggered combo when it dies
for the crumbling
(i also need to check if thrown objects make a sound)

=== @ DergerSwerson 05/06/2023 14:56

can at the very least , Hero->HeldWeapon be implemented? so that you can get attributes of the currently held weapon?

=== @ DergerSwerson 05/06/2023 14:58

things like perhaps Tile. Just being able to differentiate the tile would go a long way for a script i want to make

=== @ DergerSwerson 05/06/2023 20:51

ive got what i want to do to work using jank out of the ass, but still need to be able to remove lifted stuff from the hands some day
