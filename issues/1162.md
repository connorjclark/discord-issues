Enemies that drop from the ceiling aren't falling in pits until they land, but ones I've raised up with a script fall in while in the air. I'm assuming the fall from ceiling pattern is setting the move flag?

uhhh, nope
ceiling pattern has no special code

=== @ Moosh 11/10/2021 00:57

Then I have no fucking idea what's going on

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2021 01:04

out of curiosity, what's the Z you're setting the enemies to?
And are they being initialized over a pit?

=== @ Moosh 11/10/2021 01:05

Initialized over safe ground, Z value of 32
And I can't reproduce it in a test quest
Yet I can see those fuckers flying. I'm not doing anything particularly complicated here :/

Oh! FFS I figured it out
Its NPC->Stun

Setting NPC->Stun makes them fall in while in the air

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 01:09

. . . interesting

=== @ Moosh 11/10/2021 01:10

Which is super strange. I'd think it'd make them _not_ able to fall in if Stun was interfering

```if(can_pitfall() && ((z <= 0 && !isflier(id)) || stunclk) && !superman)
        {
            fallCombo = check_pits();
        }``` @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)
I think you missed some parenthesis

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 10:58

Fixed
