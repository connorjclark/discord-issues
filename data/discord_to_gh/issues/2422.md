Example script:
```item script PitDisrespecter
{
    void run()
    {
        for(int i=0; i<64; ++i){
            Link->MoveXY(DirX(Link->Dir), DirY(Link->Dir));
            if(!Link->Falling&&!Link->Drowning&&Link->Action!=LA_FALLING&&Link->Action!=LA_DROWNING)
            {
                Link->Action = LA_NONE;
                Link->Action = LA_ATTACKING;
            }
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
Despite trying to check for LA_FALLING and stopping the attacking, he instead slides right over, waits for a bit after the attack animation finishes, then falls

This seems fundamentally part of how Link's stuff works
good luck to whoever tries to fix this, it won't be me

Kinda figured, but das a double fuck sundae

just move the pit stuff to before attackclk? (optionally compat QR it assuming it matters?)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/07/2023 09:55

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "just move the pit stuff to be…"): maybe that'll work
fuck if I'm taking the time to test that that works and doesn't break anything
and, uh, also, this version of this function is only called for certain qrs
newer player movement affects that

.....can't exactly just move it up here
given that it would be moving to an entirely different FUNCTION
. . . it might just be able to be moved up to the other function.
but, like, not entirely sure
and I'm very burned out atm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/07/2023 09:57

fair

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/07/2023 09:58

(If you want to try just moving both of those up.... feel free. If it just works, then hey, quick fix. I just don't have the energy.)
~~(Hell, if you want to add the MoveAtAngle stuff #2421 , that shouldn't be too bad either. It's literally just copying the internal functions from `enemy::` and adding equivalent ZScript access. Except, some of the params are different- but they are just passed to the movexy - player has no SPW_ shit, has some bools instead)~~

No energy perfectly understandable. Take your time and don't mind my incessant questions and requests

imagine an energy
