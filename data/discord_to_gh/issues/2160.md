example: `zquest.exe idonotexist` to try and open a quest file that doesn't exist. It gets stuck looking like this.

Confirmed for windows and mac.

update_hw_screen missing somewhere

.....huh
what the fuck
This seems like it has to be something with your rendering stuff @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
because
in `void box_end(bool pause)`

It prints `"-- press a key --"` to the box_out
before it waits for input
....`box_out` calls `update_hw_screen(true);` at the end, forcing a render draw.
Debugging, it does enter `render_zq()`
.....and yet it seems to be failing to render that change?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 03:20

...stepping through it in debug it did render that one time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 03:21

......ah.
I'm very fucking confused as to why that fixed it, but I fixed it.

this is the proper output

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 03:27

it's because altho box_out did call `update_hw_screen(true)` (force) ... there's a pesky myvsync variable that prevents the call to `render_zq`
i'll check that is safe to update

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/05/2023 03:31

that should be ignored by force being true
that's.... kinda the entire point of force
.....and would also explain why stepping through seemed to work
as that took long enough that the vsync was ready

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/05/2023 03:32

yes
