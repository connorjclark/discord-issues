the bottle still gets filled, but there's no way to change the pickup graphic.

^ Needs to set the held item to the bottle item ID that was filled
could have sworn it was doing so before

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/12/2024 05:49

```cpp
int32_t slot = game->fillBottle(QMisc.bottle_shop_types[tmpscr[tmp].catchall].fill[PriceIndex]);
id2 = find_bottle_for_slot(slot);
ptr->id = id2;
pstr = 0;
pickup |= ipHOLDUP;
```
ptr->id should be `QMisc.bottle_shop_types[tmpscr[tmp].catchall].fill[PriceIndex]`?
and not the slot index

doesnt show when going into warp

=== @ Attempt 02/12/2024 05:58

oh lol
i had the same issue
or wait

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/12/2024 06:01

had to set guy id to not none
this dialog is too easy to mess up

=== @ Attempt 02/12/2024 06:01

no yeah mine was a different issue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/12/2024 06:02

am in a new quest

and its only two items?

=== @ Attempt 02/12/2024 06:03

well one, you only got 2 items set

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/12/2024 06:03

doh I forgot to reset to the default potion bottle shop
this is the fake one i made

=== @ Attempt 02/12/2024 06:04

or rather two contents set

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/12/2024 06:04

(i thought shop index 0 was busted so made a new one)

=== @ Attempt 02/12/2024 06:05

ye and 2 ya manually choose the graphic via a combo in the bottle shop editor

=== @ Attempt 02/12/2024 06:06

by clicking the graphic

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/12/2024 06:12

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "ptr->id should be `QMisc.bott…"): no
thats the bottle fill amount

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2024 06:21

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "ptr->id should be `QMisc.bott…"): it should be the item ID of the bottle that gets filled
which should be calculated at some point in the function....

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/12/2024 06:22

that is what ptr->id is being set to now
but it shows item 0 being held
the value for ptr->id is not zero though.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2024 06:23

what's being set to `helditem`?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/12/2024 06:26

nothing, thats what was missing
fixed

=== @ Attempt 02/12/2024 06:53

that would do it
considering none usually defaults to item id 0, which is the 1 rupee
