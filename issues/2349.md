Currently there is no direct way to set player knockback in script like there is for npcs, so I'm requesting for it to be added. This will be a lot of work according to Emily so I'm putting it as a feature request for now instead of bugging her.

If it is going to be the same as it is for enemies, I can expect to see ``Player->NoSlide, Player->SlideClock, Player->SlideSpeed, Player->CanSlide(), Player->Slide() and Player->Knockback()`` being added.

(replying to @ Orithan "Currently there is no direct…"): The engine access may be different, as it needs to be based on how the player engine knockback works.

`Player->Knockback()` can be expected to be pretty much the same, as `npc->Knockback()` was written entirely from scratch for script use, so player would be the same.
