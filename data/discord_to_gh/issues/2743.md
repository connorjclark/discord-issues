It seems there might be some subscreen elements that break if you insert tile space in the tile editor. I've only seen life gauge pieces break though, but there could be more? Tested in Alpha 119.

*sigh*
@ Moosh any chance you can handle this for me
it's literally what you just did for auto combos lol
but... err... a bit more needs to be checked because widgets

What did Moosh do for auto combos? commit sha?

`zq_tiles.cpp`, `bool do_movetile_united(tile_move_data const& tmd)`.
It keeps lists of things that would be affected by the tile change, and then updates them based on the change. Needs to account for everything, isn't accounting for subscreen stuff.
