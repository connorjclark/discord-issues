Secrets->Next flag doesn't seem to work on layers other than 0 anymore (it used to work on all layers for a single screen)

Idea: maybe add a Secrets, and specific secret types (like candle, arrow, etc.) flags to the list of weapons in the Triggers tab of all combos. So that any combo could potentially be Secrets->Next or ->Previous, etc.

I don't recall touching anything with this recently

This is also happening with the ``Step->Secrets`` combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2022 13:18

...you sure it used to work?
also, `Step->Secrets` has NOTHING to do with this @ Orithan ; separate report please

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2022 13:20

@ vlamart should fix
