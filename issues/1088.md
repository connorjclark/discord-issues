I have programed 15 bombs you start the game with, but only 3 keep ending up in my inventory when i pick up bomb ammo.  This happens a second time when I pick up the Super bomb.  I have super bombs as their own selectable items next to normal bombs.   In the Alphas before what i had setup worked absolutely fine.   When i pick up a super bomb, my bombs are reduced back to 3 and i have to pick up the 15 bomb increase item again.   Bombs and Super Bombs share the same bag.  I think this should be undone for super bombs to have their own bag item.

It messes up when fused with Normal bombs is why.
Anyways, there should be an option to undo this.

Is bthis also in A95?

@ SkyLizardGirl need a bit more info on this

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/27/2021 03:10

Super bombs think they are infinite if I pick them up
And my regular bombs go down to 3
.
Because of a technical issue I switched my bombs around with Super bombs
Because the dungeons in my game use that
So Regular bombs are the super bombs
And super bombs are regular bombs.
But the stats I changed to what they are supposed to be for both.
In game
I have done this from the start of my games development
It would be impossible to undo everything on all the maps just to put bomb areas at default
But my bomb counters are not counting the bombs correctly
When I pick them up
This was not a problem until like alpha 2.55 Alpha 97 - then this started to do this
I will check them too now also

Hmm
could you send your quest over so I can see what you're doing?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/27/2021 11:16

Do you have the superbomb multiplier set properly? This seemsike a qst design fault and not an engine fajlt.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/27/2021 14:59

well I have no way of knowing that until I see the quest
but even then, I still need it so I can recreate the bug circumstances

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/28/2021 00:49

Hold on
i gotta get it ready to send

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/28/2021 01:29

..
My bombs are acting weird now.
i am supposed to have 15 of both but they are accessed wrong.
its uploading now.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 10/28/2021 01:31

Also when i use either they think they are counting the other.
I put the Normal Bomb and Super Bomb outside the House when you first start the game.

(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl "Also when i use either they t‚Ä¶"): your super bombs are set to be a bomb item class and your bombs are set to be a super bomb item class
your subscreen counter for super bombs is checking bomb ammo and your subscreen counter for bombs is checking super bombs

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 03:28

(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl "Because of a technical issue‚Ä¶"): oh, wait, I see
hmm

your super bombs are still only giving you super bombs, when they should be giving you bombs (cause you switched the two) (same problem with regular bombs)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 08:33

@ SkyLizardGirl also, I think you have super bombs set to only be used by ariana
229 is Super Bombs

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 08:35

find this line in your script and comment it out if you want both Link and Ariana to use Super Bombs
A script is taking away your super bombs
