Doesn't really matter if it's internal or just a function in std that calculates it from the enemy's iframes, but a way to read the correct displayed CSet from an enemy even when it's flashing would make sense. IsFlickering a bit less necessary because it's just `n->InvFrames&1`, but I could see it being handy as a function in case more rules that change flickering timing are added.

```int FlashCSet(npc n)
{
    if(Game->FFRules[qr_ENEMIESFLICKER])
        return n->CSet;
    unless(n->InvFlicker)
        return n->CSet;
    if(n->InvFrames)
        return 9-(n->InvFrames>>1);
    return n->CSet;
}

bool IsFlickering(npc n)
{
    unless(Game->FFRules[qr_ENEMIESFLICKER])
        return false;
    unless(n->InvFlicker)
        return false;
    if(n->InvFrames&1)
        return true;
    // No way to get NES sprite flicker?
    return false;
}```
Here's my functions. Haven't actually verified that either are engine accurate though...
