So this is an old argument I had with Zoria where I reported the same bug to him in three different circumstances and couldn't get him to budge on the current sideview damage combo collision code being broken and unacceptable. Best I could do at the time was talk him into adding the `Sideview Spike Detection Prior to 2.50.1RC1` compat rule. Emily asked about this in another channel though, so I figured it'd a good time to re-evaluate the behavior and talk about changing it again (FIXED fixed sideview damage combo collision, hooray)

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:45

So Exhibit A: Link will take damage stepping just one toe out onto this platform when a spiked combo is next to it. The combo does not to be solid flush with the platform, it just needs to be there at all. This is absolutely garbage for gameplay reasons but I can at least see Zoria's argument for the behavior being correct. There is a spike there and Link is touching it. Okay fine.

Exhibit B: I have now moved the platform up half a tile. Link still takes damage while walking out over the spike. Absolute madman shit here, it's not even remotely colliding

Exhibit C: Same as above, but this time the spike is an FFC moving upwards. Here it hits me once again a full half a tile below me

oh fun
So is that with or without the current QR checked?
And what does the other state DO?

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:48

This is with the compat rule unchecked. With it checked none of this happens but solid damage combos don't work in sideview at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 03:48

oh
fun

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:49

Zoria insisted at the time that extending Link's hitbox down a full half tile in sideview was just the only reasonable way to do it. I can't say I don't believe him that rewriting this collision would be a lot of work but he had to be smashed out of his mind to think this was a good look for the engine

=== @ tim 06/28/2022 03:50

i cant even begin to wrap my head around that
totally disagree with that

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:50

Incidentally this discussion I believe was what drove me to write this script: https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=354

=== @ tim 06/28/2022 03:51

ideally damage combos in sideview should have some leeway
stuff like screen A and B should never hurt

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:52

I would agree. I'd say half of Link's sprite should be standing on the solid damage before it can hurt

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 03:52

yeah, this is.... bleh
I can see why zoria did what he did

=== @ tim 06/28/2022 03:53

ideally some kind of falling should contribute to actually hitting the spikes

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:53

I don't think the fix itself was his doing at least. This was added before he came on as dev, he just refused to fix it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 03:53

(Keeping in mind, afaik, what he did was not make it hit you lower- I don't think he was responsible for that, it's old?)
yeah
he just gave no fix, which is understandable
because
this
is a fucking MESS

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:54

I haven't made a sideview quest in a long while and the compat rule does work for my purposes. So no rush here
Just thought this was worth bringing up again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 03:55

I feel like the answer
would be to add `x+8,y+16` as an exact pixel check
and nothing else

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 03:57

That makes sense. Though I'd do different pixel checks depending on Link's direction since +8 isn't centered
+7 for left, +8 for right, +7&+8 for up/down

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 04:00

The other thing is that solid and nonsolid damage combos are using the same collision code right now I think. Ideally Link should be doing one pass for nonsolid combos using his full combo collision rect and then a second pass for solid using reasonable points along the edges of his hitbox

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:09

errr
check combo rules for `"Better Sideview Damage Combo Detection"`
and tell me if that does anything
because I think that's a deedee addition

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:12

@ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 04:12

Oh!
be funny if I just goldfish brained and Deedee already fixed this one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:13

and I don't know how it works at all, because it isn't in the function I was just trying to edit to add this
so if that like, works
```cpp
{ "Better Sideview Damage Combo Detection", qr_LESS_AWFUL_SIDESPIKES, 
    "When enabled, damage combos in sideview will only do their"
    " check if the Player is standing on solid ground and is"
    " mostly on the damage combo. This does not affect the"
    " check for bonking your head on a damaging ceiling; see"
    " 'Sideview Spike Detection Prior to 2.50.1RC3' for that."},
```

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 04:15

That seems to break solid spike top surfaces altogether?
never mind I'm a dumbass, was messing with effect squares ü§¶

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:16

pffft
effect squares would do that

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 04:17

Yeah this is basically exactly the behavior I wanted. I guess the only bug here is when I went to make a test quest to confirm the bug was still there, this rule wasn't on by default

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:19

haha

=== @ Moosh 06/28/2022 04:19

Sorry for taking your time on a bug that was already solved. Maybe check that rule on like every preset that exists

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:19

*holds CTRL+Z to undo 10 minutes of coding*
There's literally a function `alwaysOnRules()` for things like this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:22

I literally had a fix ready to test
it was jank as fuck and probably awful
but ready to test
and I went to find the other spike QR's description to copy it
and when I ctrl+F'd for `SPIKE`, I found the OTHER one
and just went `oh. Deedee was here already. Bleh.`

Feature Request: Teach the end user to read

XD
Just pushed a change
so, uh, now the rule should be on, by default
