Enemy Defense - Break Shield. Un-hardcode hammer.
 Also Enemy defense - Ignore Shield 
Enemy Defense - Repair Shield
Enemy Defense - Extended Knockback

i wonder if marking the *item* as being able to break shields would be a more efficient way to do this, as it would then allow you to have an additional defense resolution for said item in the enemy editor (block, OHKO, hurt only if power > x, etc.)

i've seen a few quests like myst isle do interesting things with the hammer where it could break darknut shields but it doesn't otherwise harm them, and i'd ideally like that customization to be preserved for the other itemclasses

I don`t think that shield breaking should be item property. For instance, enemy has wooden shield and any fire based lweapon should destroy it, being it candle flame, wand fire, Dins Fire, script generated fire etc.

You could just set all 4 of those weapons to be shield-breaking, right?

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "You could just set all 4 of t…"): Wrong. If you do that, fire will break non-flammable shields.
