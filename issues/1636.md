I think it's a bit of a lingering glitch honestly, sometime when I go to bomb a wall in my quest it causes ZC to crash. I also notice this happening occasionally when I go to use the sword outside of the A button. I think it's a bit of lingering hardcoded behavior issues.

I am not going to be available for an hour or two due to some housework I need to do.

Can you please DM your quest to the developers so they can look at it and the crash

I think I found a way to somewhat consistently trigger the crash, you need to create a save file and make sure A, B, and Y are enabled as re-assignable item buttons (basically the same setup as my wip) and make sure to have a few inventory items in your inventory before making a save, then restart ZC and load the save file. Then press a after loading the file.

Can you do that setup again with a recent nightly? So it'll be sent to our crash reporting.
