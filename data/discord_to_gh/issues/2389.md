Pretty simple, lifting and throwing feels cool, but it's a little strange that there's no pause and throwing animation. I don't think I necessarily needs a unique one, but the general stab / attack animation looks like a throw to begin with, sooo...pretty self explanatory. Seems like it'd be really easy to script but also handy to have a rule for.
