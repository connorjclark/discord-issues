As I mentioned here, Open() seems to treat the file not existing as an error. Would be nice to have a function that just returns false if a file doesn't exist without printing that error

ü§¶
okay so I may have spoken too soon. The error was coming from the file's extension, specifically the lack thereof

// Any extension other than banned ones, including no extension, is allowed.
bool validate_userfile_extension(string const& path)
{
    std::string ext = std::filesystem::path(path).extension().string();
    return banned_extensions.find(ext) == banned_extensions.end();
}```
this comment in ffscript.cpp indicates that a file with no extension is allowed, but then it's clearly there in the list of banned extensions

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 06:24

So is no extension actually "dangerous"? In this case it's a temp file just being used as a flag for when another file should be read/written to. It's empty on purpose and I figured an extension wasn't necessary

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 13:11

....err
Pretty sure that empty string at the end was terminating the list or something before
and not actually being used as a filter?
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) did you change that?
(replying to @ Moosh "https://discord.com/channels/‚Ä¶"): also, `FileSystem->FileExists()`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2023 17:29

I already said this was a bug and I'd be fixing it later today üòâ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 17:30

ah, don't see where that was said
k

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2023 17:31

I changed that from a array to a std set and the line was so long I didn't notice/realized the terminating empty value üëÄ

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 17:41

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "also, `FileSystem->FileExists‚Ä¶"): damn I am double blind. I did think to scroll down to see if it was under directory but didn't scroll up to filesystem or just search ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 17:43

the point being, putting it on `file` doesn't work
as you can't do anything with a file that isn't opened
so you can't really check existence like that
...FileSystem is for things that don't require an open file pointer, such as this.

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:20

> as you can't do anything with a file that isn't opened
Y'know, while this does make sense, you can ->Open a file that isn't open.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 18:21

which is opening the file
so here's the question
```cpp
file f;
f->Open()```
```cpp
file f;
f->Exists();```
In the first, what the hell does this have to do with the `f` pointer? Well, it opens it as a file.

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:21

Guessing that one was a Zoria. Since every other pointer in ZScript would work like `file f = FileSystem->Open()` or something of the sort

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 18:22

In the second, what the hell does this have to do with the `f` pointer? Nothing.
(replying to @ Moosh "Guessing that one was a Zoria‚Ä¶"): no, this was 100% mine

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:22

really?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 18:22

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "In the first, what the hell d‚Ä¶"): ^
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "In the second, what the hell‚Ä¶"): ^
That's why `Exists()` doesn't work there
but, for `Open()`....

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:23

But it also changes the pointer calling it doesn't it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 18:23

`bitmap->Create()` and `npc->Create()` also exist similarly
(replying to @ Moosh "But it also changes the point‚Ä¶"): yes, which was originally designed for `npc->Create()`, which, was zoria's.

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:23

or is there something else going on with file pointers I'm not getting
ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 18:24

```cpp
bool Open("filepath");
 * If the file pointer has not been allocated, this function will allocate it.
 * Closes any open file connected to the file pointer.
 * Attempts to open the file at "[zc root]/Files/[questname]/[filepath]"
 * Returns true if successful, false if not.
 * File is opened with mode "rb+" (a read/write binary mode)
 *     If the file does not exist, it will fail.
 * For an equivalent text file mode, use 'OpenMode("filepath", "r+")'```
key line ` * If the file pointer has not been allocated, this function will allocate it.`

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:24

This way of doing things is kinda foreign to me because of old ZScript precedent. Didn't even know npc->Create() was a _thing_

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 18:25

...you can also `file->Allocate()`
I am surprised that one wasn't `FileSystem->AllocateFile()`, frankly

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:25

What exactly does that do?

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:27

oh right this is just from the pre ownership days isn't it
having to manually allocate and deallocate pointers ü§¢

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 18:28

I mean, you still have to allocate them
it's just that `Open()` and `Create()`
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "key line ` * If the file poin‚Ä¶"): ^

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:31

But it's less necessary to do it before using the pointer because you can design as if it's used by something rather than for something. It's a lot easier for a file pointer to be temporary with ownership
So I wouldn't see myself allocating without opening or creating anymore

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:34

...actually I say that but in the situation where I'm using them, maybe it makes sense ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2023 18:35

Keep in mind that you cannot `Own()` it if it is not allocated
nothing works on a non-allocated pointer unless it specifically says otherwise
so in a situation where you would want to own it WITHOUT opening it
you would NEED `Allocate()`

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:36

Oh. That would make sense and I'm now wondering how I didn't run into that

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:38

trying to own a non allocated pointer spits out an error right?

=== @ Moosh 01/03/2023 18:39

No yeah it definitely does. I had to make own and free functions for paldata so I'd have noticed if something was sussy...
now wondering why my code didn't error
