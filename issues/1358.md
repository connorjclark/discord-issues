Yes, I'm talking about Goriyas. Probably shouldn't apply to the Goriya 3/Rapid-Fire shooting style because it IS rapid-fire and other enemies that use it, such as Death Knights, don't halt
(If added, a row of tiles for halting should be added to both the Goriya 1 and 2 New Enemy Tiles where there was previously a blank row)

The reason the row was removed in the first place is because they don't wait for a short bit after halting before firing in the NES game.
(They don't wait to finish moving onto the next tile like they do in ZC, either - they can fire whenever they feel like it, and even turn in whatever directions they're able to. Normally this just means backwards, but this can include to the sides if they happen to be on a 16x16 grid intersection.)

That is exactly the opposite of what I want and the reason I'm asking for this
Vile creatures

Yeah, their unpredictability is what makes them the hardest enemy in their dungeon enemy group. üòõ

Unless you consider Dodongos an enemy due to them respawning, and put 8 of them in a room like Outlands did...

:p

LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGG
At least ZC doesn't have to deal with the insane slowdown. ^_^

...oh yeah, I need to test the Dodongo smoke range in Z1 again. It doesn't seem very accurate.
