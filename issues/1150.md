These appear to be read only currently. Any reason why? It's a mild nuisance when a script causes Link to enter a screen from over a pit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 06:26

Probably just hasn't been added yet
I'll see what I can do

=== @ Moosh 11/02/2021 06:26

Thanks. No rush, as I've already got a system to get around it
Just has a small downside that Link flickers

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 13:57

No, I considered this one entirely unsafe without a qr that allows it.
These properties are written bybscrolling and warps and pits.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 13:58

...yes, they are
cause that's the entire point of EntryX/EntryY
it's for saving where you first entered the screen, so that pits and etc know where you put you

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 13:59

Wo if you want to allow r/w a qr or instr qr should be added with a precaution that basic system timing can override them or timing could override scrolling qnd warps causing softlocks or even crashes.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:00

My general theory is that you could just write x and y and until EntryX and EntryY were proven safe to write or were protected by a rule, not to allow writing them.
There are a number of additions where I felt writing may be unsafe so I waited on that.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:01

they can't be proven safe to write without allowing them to be written to

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:01

Yew
Henc3
Add an instr rule first

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:01

But they don't need a QR to enable them

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:02

If not enabled, ignore writing to them

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:02

if they are unsafe, a QR to enable them can be added after the fact.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:02

You can make it a default on rule
But it is a trivial to add safeguard
I'd wait for Emily to rule on this one ere merging

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:03

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I highly doubt you object to this

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:03

As encouraging a possibly unsafe behaviour can be a huge down the road headache

=== @ Moosh 11/03/2021 14:04

Sorry didn't know this would be a whole _thing_

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:04

It is literally three lines of code to insulate it now
Well, four to enable it by decault
Always CYA

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 14:19

They never should have been read-only to begin with

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:48

wait a minute here
I apparently did a setEntryX an setEntryY
??
as part of Screen->
Not sure why at this point.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:50

So if writing to the is not working, it is probably due to the exact sorts of system events that I mentioned worrying about
```case SCREENDATAENTRYX:         
        {
            int newx = vbound((value/10000),0,255);
            tmpscr->entry_x = newx;
            if ( get_bit(quest_rules, qr_WRITE_ENTRYPOINTS_AFFECTS_HEROCLASS) )
            {
                Link.entry_x = (zfix)(newx);
            }
            
        }
        case SCREENDATAENTRYY:         
        {
            
            int newy = vbound((value/10000),0,175);
            tmpscr->entry_y = newy;
            if ( get_bit(quest_rules, qr_WRITE_ENTRYPOINTS_AFFECTS_HEROCLASS) )
            {
                Link.entry_y = (zfix)(newy);
            }
            break;    //B
        }```
and there is already a QR
In instruction rules
@ Moosh
So all the stuff I said should be done has been in place as I discussed for some tie
You probably just need to enable the rule.
My senile mind forgot that I already did it all
the rule is

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 13:53

Oh! Well that's sure hidden away. I assumed instruction rules would all default to whatever makes sense. I'm also still not clear on why it's a rule...
But thanks for pointing it out

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:54

Writing Screen->EntryX EntryY Resets Entry Spawn Points
and it s enabled by default n new quests as I had also said that it should be

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 13:55

Huh

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:55

Because I was unsure what bugs could occur if you do it and wanted a safeguard.

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 13:55

I know this quest was loaded more recently than whenever you added that

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:55

```//Alpha 85

Default new rule on in new quests or on Pick Ruleset.
Fix position of new Instruction Rule in Dialogue
Added a script quest instruction setting to cause Link's respawn
    points to match script-written EntryX and EntryY for Screen->Entry*.
Fixed the bug where Link's spin attack animation is mused when he falls
    into pits if he is holding a charged sword.
    ( ZoriaRPG, 12th November, 2020 )```

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 13:56

But it does indeed default to set on a new quest. So gotta be something about loading a tileset

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:57

tilesets use whatever rules the tileset used when it was saved in whatever version it was last saved
that is normal
using Pick Ruleset will allow you to instantly convert to the `Modern` ruleset
otherwise they use legacy rules and may use version flags

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 13:58

Right, but this being a script related rule, and tilesets not having any scripts in them, would it not make sense for it to default to on?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 13:58

to set rules that you do not want
it was saved before those existed
it is a .qst file

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 14:00

...Oh. I think I'm just getting mixed up how this works because some of these rule bits have inverted checkboxes ü§¶

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 14:01

if a tileset was made in 2.10, and you open it in the latest nightly where 2.10 quests flag all windrobes in 2.10 quests to use the bugged movement, zq will flag the enemies as if it were any other 2.10 quest
inverted?

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 14:01

Like all these default to checked but it's not because ZQuest recognizes the quest format version and updates the ruleset to enable fixes, it's because they're all worded as "don't do thing"

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 14:02

ah
well
that is how compatibility based rules tend to function
Just use Pick Rulset, select Modern done.

=== @ Moosh 11/04/2021 14:03

On an existing project it's easier to just handle case by case but will keep that in mind for next time

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/04/2021 14:04

sure
funny though how I described how I would do this an I already did it in that exact manner

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 07:20

Fwiw, this shows that presented with a logic issue my mind works in the same way, repeatedly
@<role: Developer> You can close this thread as the feature already exists and the report was due to user errror/miscomprehension.

"already exists"
