Those turnable one way doors Link walks into from Links awakening and then turn you around after he steps into them. Those should be optional along within the dungeon door shutter system built into ZC. One can be found in tail cave at the beginning.

Is what I am talking about. Nobody has these yet right?

Haven't seen one yet.
... ... what a strange little door. O.o

It’s a shutter door thing so it could be built into the system because it’s often overlooked.
I’m imagining an NES version of it.

Could probably replicate it with normal combos and combo cycling with walkability tricks, now that I think about it.

Link steps into them and they turn around with him standing in one. They are also one way.
