oh bother

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/07/2023 02:56

fudge, i assumed https://api.github.com/repos/Zquestclassic/zquestclassic/git/matching-refs/tags/ was in order of commit date but .. it is alphabetic

i was leaning too much on github api for this. forgot to KISS. So just gonna change it to query the website (like https://zquestclassic.com/releases/2.55.json ), and added to the release process writing the above file

Fixed for next nightly

Now it downgrades to 2023-11-06 nightly. With this bug present.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/07/2023 06:38

it's fixed (just try again)
