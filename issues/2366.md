Instead of having to set certain items needed in test mode via initial data, can we set it up via ZQ? That would be so helpful! And maybe have the items saved for test mode as well?

I'm thinking a setup similar to initial data but JUST for test mode.

Emily's nixed the idea in the past, but there's a script for it

Ah okay, thank you!

Yeah, I nixed the idea because this is basically asking to bloat the quest with an entire second set of Init Data. Much more script territory, which is why I made sure scripts can check when test mode is active.

Good to know. Thank you!
