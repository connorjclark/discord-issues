A bunch of the fonts Zoria added for 2.55 have some characters that look botched, presumably from being scaled down from their base resolution. For example, the lowercase s in Sherwood looks like a g. Could we touch these up to look more presentable?
I'd be willing to edit them myself if need be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2021 04:03

If you want to submit a revised `fonts.dat` that you feel is better, feel free
just don't change any fonts that existed in 2.53

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/22/2021 06:56

Aren't the fonts that Zoria added technically his copyright?
Wouldn't he have a leg to stand on if we kept them?

=== @ Moosh 12/22/2021 07:24

That's a good question. I assumed that given how Zoria was about things the fonts he added would be public domain. I doubt he made any of them himself

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/22/2021 07:32

I remember him making a fuss about this

=== @ Moosh 12/22/2021 07:33

Looking at the list the ones that appear to have downscaling crust are:
-Sherwood
-Fantasy Letters
-COCO Mode I

=== @ Moosh 12/22/2021 13:06

Hmm, tried editing fonts.dat and it's giving me errors and crashing. Presumably because my images are in the wrong format. Any idea what exactly it's expecting? Tried bmp and pcx, seems Gimp may be up to no good again

Here's the example I was testing with. Also the one I'm least certain about "fixing" because it's so scuffed I can't tell what it was supposed to be and have no idea where Zoria got the original aside from that it resembles this one:

I'd use only the allegro tools
All of them are in /utilities
Grabber, sprite editor, font editor

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2021 02:10

Also crashes when saved with aseprite :/

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:10

Then I have no idea
I've never edited fonts.dat, only qst.dat

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2021 02:26

Hmm okay managed to get it to not crash but then I get the ever so helpful "error saving [path]"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:26

Did it save the .dat file?
I've gotten a saving error for the ".h" file it's also supposed to save
But that can be ignored, as long as the .dat is updated

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2021 02:27

It does appear it saved my chances
We have no idea what these supposed errors are?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:28

It's failing to save the header file
I have no idea why
But it also isn't that important
Because it can function without it
All the header does is define a bunch of constants for accessing the dat file
Which is extra hilarious getting the error for qst.dat
Because that has one file in it, so literally just one constant of value 0 in its header...

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2021 02:30

welp

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2021 09:55

Talked to Zoria a bit about the source of the fonts in question. Apparently he redrew them by hand off of references and that's why they have these flaws ü§î
Also gave me this to pass along. I'm pretty sure you guys removed the splash screen altogether but if it's still there, fixed typo

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 10:12

Yeah, we removed the splash screen entirely
it was dumb

=== @ Moosh 12/30/2021 09:57

Hey, so sorry I completely forgot about this
Here's a dat file with my edits. Check it out and see if it works.

=== @ Moosh 12/30/2021 09:59

Fonts affected should be Sherwood (minor edits), Coco Mode 1, Coupe, and Sinclair QL (this one appears to be very similar to Coupe for some reason)

=== @ Moosh 12/30/2021 10:01

The last two required resizing some of the characters, but those characters were also completely broken so...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2022 20:32

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I wouldn't know anything about this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/17/2022 20:42

uhh
if you want to check it, just replace the `classic_fonts.dat` and see if the fonts look right
and if they do, then.... it can replace the `classic_fonts.dat` in the repo

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2022 20:43

Ah, okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 13:21

(meta) thread name was changed: üîìCan we fix the botched fonts?

=== @ Moosh 03/29/2023 04:09
