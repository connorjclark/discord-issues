The way I made enhanced music not loop in some particular cases was by having a script check if the position in the song was near the end, and then set the music volume to zero, which also meant I had to turn it back up when playing a song again. Would save a lot of hassle by including the option üëç

Will definitely get to this at some point, though I suspect the internal solution would be rather similar to the ZScript one. Any reason you're setting volume to 0 instead of doing PlayMIDI(0)?

Ah does that do a similar thing to playing the 0th string where it clears whatever is currently going on

Yup, stops any midi or enhanced music
