When I first load my quest, any references to my global array in my OnLaunch script gives this error: 
```Global script 5 (OnLaunch):
Invalid pointer (0) passed to array (don't change the values of your array pointers)```
If I save, this problem no longer occurs.

This seems to indicate that OnLaunch is running before Init. But ZScript_Timing.txt says otherwise. And it makes sense because nothing should run before global variables are initialized save for other things in the init script. So what gives?

`ZScript->Quest Script Settings->Script->Use Old Global Init and SaveLoad Timing`
is this checked or not?

god fucking dammit 🤦
Get real used to old bug reports resurfacing as I completely overlook these compat rules
Not to mention how half of them are "use old" and the other half "use new"
