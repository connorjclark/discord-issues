Old report I think? :https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1004677243831865344

Here is an image I'm trying to grab a palette from in the latest nightly
Look at the colors on the right

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2022 07:20

the orientation is impossible to work with; they aren't arranged in a cset-way and I have to do huge amounts of trial and error to figure out which colors are csets 2-4, and which are not csets 2-4 and where each color goes in each cset, especially since there's duplicate colors

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2022 07:21

Here's what it looks like in Alpha 107

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2022 07:23

as you can see, in 107 it's ordered in the exact same way with all the csets in the exact same order, it's super easy to rip specific csets

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2022 07:24

With the switch to Allegro 5, this has become unusable, and I can no longer outsource palette editing to external software
Here is the image in question

(yes, it looks ugly; I'm trying to use tints to get specific level palette coloration I need)
On a similar note
Here's a palette editing software by Moosh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/20/2022 07:27

I think the old report was fixed *specifically for .bmp*
so, other filetypes still need fixing
as this is an A5 issue, @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2022 07:28

You load a ZC image in Get Image 1, and click edit palette, it opens up another window and lets you do things with the palette. However, if it's *not* a ZC image, it will refuse to do anything and won't open up a window

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2022 07:29

Here's a screenshot from the latest version. If you try to open this image using the Interpal palette editor I linked above, it will not work
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1021681397502574592/1021684593977475092/zc_screen00132.png?ex=65e6c9ed&is=65d454ed&hm=c28718d65fabe40d053042444a7a90bce42fb8fe2d6e5476ca8ecceb35b4581e&)
but the other image in question (which is taken from an older alpha of 2.55) *will* work
So images aren't storing the data the same way when saved, which will also bite you in the ass when outsourcing palettes to other software

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/20/2022 07:56

Does bmp export colors as expected, and if so, is that equivalent to as if it was png?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2022 08:00

BMP is both exporting and importing as expected it seems

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2022 08:02

Though BMPs don't seem to be compatible with InterPal in general
So it's hard to confirm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2022 08:10

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/20/2022 08:20

PNGs are what seem to be broken
I'm going to bed soon so I might not be able to test stuff

=== @ Moosh 09/20/2022 19:08

For the record, Interpal shouldn't be doing anything to mess with the PNG's format. It just reads and writes a range of bytes where the palette in ZC screenshots is stored.
So I'd expect a PNG saved with ZQuest to be read incorrectly by ZQuest without the tool's involvement

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/20/2022 19:19

unfortunately, currently PNGs are saved as true color.
This had less to do with A5 upgrade, but with the port to mac. The old png code a4 plugin was partially written in x86 assembly.
I'll look into restoring it for just the windows build.

=== @ P-Tux7 09/25/2022 01:56

does .gif work or not?

=== @ Orithan 09/26/2022 02:42

Can confirm this occurs in the latest nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:47

*bump*

=== @ Orithan 10/13/2022 14:02

As of Alpha 110 this still occurs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/13/2022 14:45

"this still occurs" isn't necessary unless someone says there's been an update

=== @ P-Tux7 10/19/2022 01:09

i think they just wanted to make sure the thread stayed visible for all the devs following it because discord is stupid and doesn't let you pin threads to be unexpirable, even for *yourself only*
(the 3 day/7 day timer expiring means it disappears off the channel list even for people following the thread, and they have to manually find it again IF they remember that it existed)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/19/2022 03:05

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i think they just wanted to m‚Ä¶"): that doesn't matter anymore
thanks to forum channels

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/08/2022 15:32

@ Shane , @ Moosh, others, here's a test build that should fix png palettes: 

~~  https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-11-08 ~~ wrong build
lmk if it works / what OS you are using

=== @ mitchfork 11/08/2022 18:56

Tried on Win10 and doesn't fix for me.  Palettes are still having unused colors deleted and reordered:
http://puu.sh/Jr3qb/25d85a1718.png
Tile importation suffers the same problems

=== @ mitchfork 11/08/2022 18:58

Tried both with snapshots created in this version and snapshots created in versions without this bug

=== @ Shane 11/08/2022 19:45

Can confirm that this bug is still persisting for me too. (Win10)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/08/2022 20:09

LOL
I built the wrong branch
Thank God this makes sense again
My bad folk, I'll message again when it's ready for testing for real

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/08/2022 20:37

pahahahaha
always fun when you just post the wrong build

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/08/2022 21:04

here we go: https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-11-08-2
@ Moosh @ Shane @ mitchfork  ü•∫

=== @ Shane 11/08/2022 21:12

Its working for me.

=== @ Shane 11/08/2022 21:15

this is awesome!

=== @ Moosh 11/08/2022 21:21

PNG works now. Rad

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/08/2022 22:11

Awesome
Any other formats that used to work but no longer do?

=== @ mitchfork 11/08/2022 22:29

PNG, BMP, and GIF were the only ones I remember using. Not sure if GIF is working or not, haven't tried

=== @ Moosh 11/09/2022 00:49

GIF still wasn't working when I tested, figured your changes were PNG specific

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 00:57

It is, I was just asking as a reminder.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 01:03

ignoring png now that its OK, which format is most important to fix?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 01:05

Assuming gif since that's the only one anyone even thought to mention
Since png and bmp both work

=== @ Moosh 11/09/2022 01:10

Oh yeah, PCX and TGA both work as well. I didn't bother testing them because the allegro docs indicated they were both supported by load_bitmap()

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 01:11

Reading the code, I think loading gif palettes should work but _saving_ gifs from ZC will lose color info.

=== @ Moosh 11/09/2022 01:14

Loading appears to lose it as well

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 01:15

ah ok

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 02:19

https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-11-09 gif fixed here?

=== @ Moosh 11/09/2022 04:12

Yup, all fixed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 04:46

Marking this fixed then.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/09/2022 07:05

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 18:56

Woo!
