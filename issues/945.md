Datatypes:```//Planned/Incomplete
warpringdata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to all Warpring Editor data.
doorsetdata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to all Doorset Editor data
misccolorsdata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to all Misc Colours dialogue data.
rgbdata : t/b/a
    (Planned) DATATYPE for colour triplets as red,green,blue in one integer value.
    Because ZScript will interpret the value as 'float' inside the script, this datatype
    allows operating on a value as a true integer.
palette : t/b/a
    (Planned) OBJECT TYPE, for loading and using USER PALETTES.
    This is similar to how user bitmaps work, and may also include a save/load format similar
    to ZPL, so that palettes created by script can be saved, then imported into other quests.
zcmididata : t/b/a
    (Planned) OBJECT TYPE for working with MIDIs, both in-quest, and as external files.
palcycledata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to all Palette Cycle data.
gamedata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to all global game data (game->, in source)
cheatsdata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to cheat code information.
subscreendata: t/b/a
```
rgbdata/palettedata stuff really probably isn't worth it
no clue what would be planned for `zcmididata`
...`gamedata` seems pointless, because, like, that's all in `Game->`
`subscreendata` seems fucking painful, and I think was intended for engine subscreen scripts, which Zoria already scrapped the idea for as not feasible

So, I petition to revise:```//Planned/Incomplete
warpringdata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to all Warpring Editor data.
doorsetdata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to all Doorset Editor data
misccolorsdata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to all Misc Colours dialogue data.
zcmididata : t/b/a
    (Planned) OBJECT TYPE for working with MIDIs, both in-quest, and as external files.
palcycledata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to all Palette Cycle data.
cheatsdata : t/b/a
    (Planned) Access to cheat code information.
```(Not sure what we want in midi data, but perhaps the ability to swap out a midi for one from a file could be useful?)

Obviously for other todo, we want to fix the parser issues (which we have a pull request to review from connorjclark which claims to handle just that)
and... not sure what else big there is. (talking before-beta todo, here, so don't need all the bugfixes listed)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/25/2021 21:16

advanced ogg stuff is currently massively bugged
as in I think Zoria poorly imported my changes, which were already pretty not great
actually outright crashes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2021 21:17

aye, that should be fixed
(make a bug report channel on it)

@ DeletedUser
Also, while I'm here,
Add `->Remove()` for all sprite types
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/29/2021 11:24

parser fix, obviously
finish import/export file types
(meta, MessageType.pins_add)
