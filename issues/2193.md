If you use Autolayer to add a new layer and the layer specified is greater than the current number of maps, it'll clamp it to that. You have to add a new map manually. Instead when this happens (provided the map count is <255) could it first add a new map and then clamp the autolayer to that? And then make a popup informing you that it did this?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/24/2023 07:08

Is there any reason to manually configure the map limit? Aren't they written in shorthand if nothing is set now? If so, I say toss out setting any limit and just always allow up to 255.

I rather like not having to scroll through empty maps to get to what I'm working on
Say going from map 1 to 63 where 63 is the last map, I just step back one map and I'm there. With 255 I have a bunch of empty space to scroll through, it's faster to scroll through them the other way

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/24/2023 07:30

We would just show one more than the last map with content.

=== @ Moosh 02/24/2023 07:51

Oh. Yeah that sounds very reasonable then

=== @ LisaDudoa 02/25/2023 04:56

Why not have a go to map keyboard shortcut
like ctrl+m, pops up a window, type in 23 go to map 23

you can set it is a favorite command

=== @ Russ 02/25/2023 16:49

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "We would just show one more t…"): Sometimes I need it to show more than this though
For example, if I’m reserving map space for maps other people are working on but I know I’ll need to import in later

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 16:50

in this case, just place a single combo on a single screen on each reserved map?

=== @ Moosh 02/25/2023 19:11

That's goofy and jank but technically still faster than using the options menu
So probably a good idea

=== @ LisaDudoa 02/25/2023 20:25

now it'd be nice if we could lable maps in a way that's seeable in the goto map screen, or customizing dmaps
is that already a feature i missed?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:26

goto maps just has map numbers, nothing else

=== @ LisaDudoa 02/25/2023 20:30

yeah, so does channging which map goes to which dmap. So i've gotta keep a notebook open beside me to see what map im using for what and what the next one is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:30

Usually I would just keep them in some order
and either make something recognizable on a map, or look at a dmap to check the map

=== @ LisaDudoa 02/25/2023 20:31

I keep them in dmap-1 order and use dmaps for everything, even layers.
but i still get confused sometimes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:31

oh, eww
that also means you can't use multiple dmaps on a single map
which you usually want to do
(for giving different screens different palettes/music, etc)

=== @ LisaDudoa 02/25/2023 20:32

I can do that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:32

(or fitting multiple dungeons in a single map)
take a look at `modules/classic/classic_1st.qst`
(NES 1st quest recreation)

=== @ LisaDudoa 02/25/2023 20:33

Oh hum. I was using a whole map per dungeon so far.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:34

the overworld:

(NES Zelda dungeons were designed to cleverly fit together neatly, so, they can be organized very nicely here)
....you can of course use a whole map per dungeon as well, but, you can do plenty well without doing that

=== @ LisaDudoa 02/25/2023 20:37

ah I figured that's how they did it, but.. i have access to 255 different maps.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:37

at best, dungeon dmaps take up 8x8
so they *can't* even take up a full map
so, it's worth doing at least two dungeons as separate 8x8 halves of a map
and, beyond that, you could use multiple dmaps in one map for other uses
like splitting an overworld up into biomes with different music/palette
(ice area, desert area, ocean area, etc)
also, fitting multiple dungeons into a single map means less maps to scroll through (and less to remember)

=== @ LisaDudoa 02/25/2023 20:39

Yeah, and it's g onna force me to get creative with the lay outs.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:40

if you stick to 2 per map you won't need to get that creative
but the more creative you get, the more you can squeeze together, I suppose

=== @ LisaDudoa 02/25/2023 20:40

I'll keep testing things out and looking through all the options.. I haven't played with zquest in a very long time.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 20:41

The latest builds are very nice
Though, uh, the latest nightly right now is a bug buggy
new one should be coming out shortly with fixes for those though

=== @ LisaDudoa 02/25/2023 20:42

I'm using 255 now , I don't think I'm using the nightly though

=== @ cbailey78 02/28/2023 20:21

Imagine if we had a full 16x8 dungeon/interior dmap setting instead of 8x8?  e.g. Level-9 had 16x8 rooms in one single dmap.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/28/2023 20:21

...to be fair, what is the difference between an Overworld and an Interior?
if there is one?
I mean, I've made a distinction in scripts before- MM2D's day/night cycle tint did not display on interior screens, but did on overworlds- but that's a script distinction

=== @ Russ 02/28/2023 20:44

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "if there is one?"): I think it’s just the size and ability to use dmap offsets

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/28/2023 20:44

so, a "16x8 interior"... would just be an overworld, effectively

=== @ Russ 02/28/2023 20:44

Dungeon is another thing, but like… probably easier to rescript an overworld or interior to act like a dungeon than to engage with that dmap type

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/28/2023 20:49

"Treat as NES Dungeon Screen" flag exists for a reason

=== @ cbailey78 02/28/2023 23:46

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""Treat as NES Dungeon Screen"…"): Oh, I forgot about that. Cool!

=== @ LisaDudoa 03/01/2023 04:48

I just wanna make overworld sized dungeons

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 04:50

I mean, my point being that you pretty much can
If you really need the NES dungeon functionality, you'd just check `Treat as NES Dungeon Screen` on every screen of an overworld dmap
...if you don't need NES dungeon functionality, you can either set the `Treat as Interior Screen` flag, or, just not? because I feel like interior and overworld are basically the same already?

=== @ LisaDudoa 03/01/2023 05:08

Just build the dungeon in an oberworld and have music change within differen dungon reguons like in the overworld using d maps since i learned you can do that.
