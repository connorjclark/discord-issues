Doesn't crash in RelWithDebInfo. Sometimes it crashes as soon as it opens, sometimes search works for a bit and then crashes.

Not seeing this (on mac). Can you get a snapshot of the stacktrace from Visual Studio?

ok just built with ASAN and get a memory issue (heap use-after-free) on startup: https://gist.github.com/connorjclark/fb5d066e5394bba3bee49cd69d1d1b2a

You can't pass data that was free'd up.
(data came from text_fit)

blah fek

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 03:06

Should the text length be based off the attempted concat (aka: do I just change it to `text_length(f, text_fit.data())` ?
fixing that, I now get a memory issue once i click on the QR search button:

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2023 03:11

the `widthSoFar = ` line should just be above the `text_fit = ` line

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 03:35

Ok

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 03:40

second issue is just that `static int32_t scroll_pos1` cannot be aliased to `size_t*`.

needs to be  `static size_t scroll_pos1`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2023 03:40

blah, oof

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 03:40

this is likey what crashed Moosh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2023 03:40

most things use int32_t I forget that scroll uses size_t
...no, tabs use size_t too, huh
musta just typoed then

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 03:41

I changed em all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2023 03:42

nice, thanks ❤️
this dialog shit is always a giant headache
Saff did a ton of the base work for it, and then it has my organic modifications as things came up needed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 03:46

uhhh except other widgets expect int32_t. `void ScrollingPane::setPtr(int32_t* ptr)`
`ZCGUI_ACCEPT_PROP(ptr, setPtr, int32_t*)` even enforces it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2023 03:46

oh? fun
then that was right for scrolling
or is it like, right only in some places and not others?
Scrollpanes were mostly Saff's work, they are like the single most confusing and headachy part of the dialog system

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 03:47

i think it can be changed to use size_t

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2023 03:48

probably sane, there's no reason to ever scroll negatively really so

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 03:50

nvm too much stuff in jwin needs to change

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 04:42

Oh i didnt notice QRPanel was just taking its size_t ptr and aliasing it to int32_t for scroll panel
`scrollpane->setPtr((int32_t*)indexptr);`
this has different behavior depending on endianness of the cpu

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2023 04:45

so should bite the bullet and make all these things size_t/int32_t ... but if this fixes Mooshes crash I'll leave it there for now.
