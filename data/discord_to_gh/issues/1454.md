sooo
@ Saffith think I need your help here
branch `2.55-combostuff-crashy`
ZQuest, small mode, combo editor
`Triggers` tab
upon selecting that tab, it crashes immediately
When attached to the debugger, it *does not break at the crash point*
I have no fucking clue what is wrong
```cpp
TabRef(name = "Triggers", ScrollingPane(
    Column(
        margins = DEFAULT_PADDING,
        Column(framed = true,
            padding = DEFAULT_PADDING+2_px,

                padding = 0_px,
                Label(text = "Min Level (Applies to all):"),
                TextField(

The prior (working) version of this block is ```cpp

```
but, while that version does not crash... well, it doesn't have the new fields I was adding.
This is the first time I'm having a problem like this expanding a gui with your system
and I see nothing that would obviously be the culprit

In debug, it gives only this as an error:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/951013800558100520/951016554915586048/unknown.png?ex=65e8192f&is=65d5a42f&hm=a935ef0a35761704f050c7163c26ba378ffa025d11cb0b4c4ba07bb211a3999d&)
no further information while attached to debugger
I'm probably off for the night now... hope you can spare the time to figure something out here, because I'm baffled.
My only guess is that it is in some way related to `ScrollingPane`, since large mode doesn't use a scrolling pane for this, and the large mode version works fine...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/09/2022 23:50

....ok, I seem to have fixed it
by just
reverting the entire ScrollingPane to what it was before
and doing it over again, slowly, testing after each step
...didn't crash once this time.
so, uh, I have no clue what caused this issue, but it's probably still lurking somewhere.

=== @ Saffith 03/10/2022 05:01

Huh. That's fun.
ScrollingPane does some weird stuff, so there may well be an issue with it...
I'll need to get stuff updated and rebuilt, and then I can poke around a bit.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 05:03

I thought it might be something with the content being too wide
but, then I specifically made something too wide to see
and, there was an issue there; it drew over the scrollbar.
but, not the source of the crash.
(I fixed the scrollbar thing, now if it has a scrollbar, it accounts for that in the `arrange()` call)

=== @ Saffith 03/10/2022 05:04

All right. Hopefully Valgrind can pick something up.
