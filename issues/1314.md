when I exit a place and the character up the stairs for go in a new place, it will down instantly the stairs and no action are possibles. I just cannot start to play a quest. my only way is to die for get out the entrance without this "stairs" issue. I've also tried in 2.53 v with no effects

Does that sound like this bug?

Titled:  "✅🔒[2.55 A100] Stairs or Cave warp tile bug "
That last sentence in your paragraph,  "I've also tried in 2.53 v __with no effects__" implies the bug _isn't_ there.  Just making sure.

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Does that sound like this bug…"): yes this is it

Awesome.  Sounds like you'd benefit from upgrading, as Emily said above.
Back up all yer stuff, make a new folder for that build, copy the quest file back in, and see if it works fine for you.  If it does, keep building in that new build, and enjoy!
