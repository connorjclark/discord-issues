How ZC should be:

The shield is not correctly held relative to the left or right of the enemy in all four directions, as can be seen in the top picture.

this meme better represents this more clearly
this is both for the enemy flags "shield is on left" and "shield is on right" where both flip sides against their relative rotation when they face left and right
