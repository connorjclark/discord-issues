Monodirectional. This is intended for setting the Guy fires to it in the Enemy Editor, to mimic BS Zelda

Oh yeah, how'd I forget. The fire enemy (guarding Zelda) in BS Zelda is also 6 frames.

I made these tiles for Cambria as BS-style fire tiles, but they can easily be used in the default tileset as the "New Enemy Tiles" for the Fire enemy and Guy (and Guy Fire, if that ever gets implemented as a Misc. Sprite) to demonstrate these new kind of animation styles if they get added. 6 frames on top, 8 frames on bottom.
