This would make one new item type, which uses a trigger to trade that one item type over and over, while changing its image up a tile and item Level also each time it's traded.  The item level is to mark if an NPC can accept the item or not depending on what level the item has become.  You would also need to line up item tiles to the right of the first item, depending how many tiles the trading sequences changes to, the trading sequence can be as long as programed until max level also.  NPC sprite tiles would need a command to check for trading item level. It plays another string if it detects the trading item level at an NPC. The NPC then gives you the next upgraded item level item.

You can already do this with SCCs

Huh?
How?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/07/2022 04:35

Have the string goto another string if you have an item

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 03/07/2022 04:35

But how would it trade the item? 0_0

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/07/2022 04:35

have that new string give you a new item and take away the old

the thing is

i want to use a single item for this sequence and just
switch the item image alone, and its level changes also.
kinda like how the jars you use to catch fairies in change item image

.
I dont want to use 12 different item slots for a trading sequence is why.

then use a script
that's not something an item will ever be able to do in engine
it would require too many attributes to be done in one item slot
