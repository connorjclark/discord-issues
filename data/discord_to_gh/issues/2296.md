Enable pound type combos to work on layers 1 and 2

=== @ P-Tux7 04/08/2023 20:51

pardon me but is there anything you can't do just by making a normal combo that's hammer-triggered?
and playing the sound, of course

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/09/2023 19:07

The pound combo hitboxes are different to the trigger hitboxes

=== @ P-Tux7 04/09/2023 19:49

hubba wha?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/09/2023 19:51

the trigger hitboxes work the same for all weapon types
the pound combo hitboxes are jank mcjank

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "added @ Deathrider"): Will check tonight

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/09/2023 22:31

haven't posted a build yet

A113 is up with this

=== @ Deathrider 04/12/2023 03:30

I see pound combos do react on layer 1, however they seem to have inherited the behavior of the up swing of the hammer triggering them

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> of course

=== @ Deathrider 04/12/2023 14:46

Figured this request would have maintained the same behavior for pound types but on other layers, guess that was an incorrect assumption

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/12/2023 14:47

No, that was a correct assumption, its just bugged
Because of COURSE something to do with the layer code fucked with the timing checks

=== @ Deathrider 04/12/2023 14:47

Ahh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2023 11:06

should be fixed

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 01:05

will this fix be testable in a nightly tonight?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 07:06

...haaaah.... yeah, along with some big looking stuff connor just pushed
`Upgrade to C++ 20`, well hello
(replying to @ Deathrider "will this fix be testable in‚Ä¶"): would have posted it sooner but I fell asleep first üò¶

#deleted-channel

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 17:36

So testing with hammer triggers on a (NONE) type combo they still trigger like before, pound combos do not seem to work at all on layer 1 now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 18:24

fucking HELL

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 23:45

(replying to @ Deathrider "So testing with hammer trigge‚Ä¶"): ...you sure you have the QR for them working on layers on still?
stupid question, but sometimes you need to ask stupid questions in debugging

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 23:48

what was it called again?

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 23:50

hu it was unchecked, I know for a fact that was checked the last time you had me check it
well it works, sorry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 23:50

Save the quest, close zq, re-open it, and check if it is still checked or not
just incase something's fucky

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 23:51

yep, still checked, maybe zq crashed st some point and that is why it didnt save?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 23:51

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
anyway, glad it works

=== @ Deathrider 04/16/2023 23:52

indeed, thanks
