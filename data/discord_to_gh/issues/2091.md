Starting in Nightly 12-14, and also in 12-15, if you enter a Insta Warp with Blackout Stairs combo, it appears input carries over onto the destination screen. Maybe input stays longer, maybe the warp is a bit faster.
This became apparent when in some of my quests, you can approach a Stairs combo from above, and THIS is the destination screen.

Prior, you could release holding down when the screen blacked out and be fine, now it is very likely you trigger the south sidewarp exit.

I am unsure what would be causing this, but apparently 107 did not have this issue but the latest does; might need to be bisected more

It seemed to be working fine in 12-12, so it's something since then.

`ALLOFF` doesn't work anymore. used to set the "Down state" to true for everything, so it'd be ignored until next press. no longer can do that because "down state" is now always reset every frame so can't be used to remember stuff.  not sure how to address, maybe the approach for https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1048494782617505812 was wrong

oh fucking EWWW
ALLOFF did THAT?
bleh....
The approach for that was not wrong, it cleaned everything up so very nicely
....it just needs a way to handle ALLOFF.....

Possibly fixed, please verify in next nightly (done in ~20m)

Verified with a test qst file, looks good to me.

Assuming this is fixed, closing.
