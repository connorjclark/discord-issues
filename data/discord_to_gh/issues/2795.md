@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) more than replays needed to be ported from the previous format. Users w/ these fields in Test Init Data are broken

@ FireSeraphim you'll have to remake them in the present build.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 08:22

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) more th…"): ah, bleh. Any chance you could have it store the current replay VERSION in the test init data, so it can be read with a version check?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 08:23

...also, `subscreen` I never expected to even be a used token, since it hasn't been editable in the dialog since before replays existed.... I'm guessing the test data just wrote every single field, not just changed ones, huh? That'll be fun.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 08:47

It should be a separate version component, not the replay one.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 08:48

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...also, `subscreen` I never…"): No, only changed stuff is written
(I'm referring to how it was, but maybe that regressed)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 08:52

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "No, only changed stuff is wri…"): `subscreen` was unused, that has no compat handling as I expected it (since it can never change) to not appear in anything- but it appeared there, so something was wrong somewhere

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 08:53

it crashed when I made a test init data (I just checked Amulet here and hit OK)

> libc++abi: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::out_of_range: Bad bounded_vec access

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 08:56

...hmm, that's my manually-thrown exception
for which vector did that throw?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 08:56

1) it was playground.qst
2) no need to change anything, just hit OK
I can't tell due to it being a macro.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 09:00

...according to the list of `tokens`, none of them should be referencing any `bounded_vec`....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 18:18

oh
well, I see, duh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 18:20

wait no I don't hmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 18:22

ah, the `zinitdata operator=` is fucking up?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 18:23

...which is defaulted?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 18:25

OH
no, I see it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 18:26

the bounded container `operator=` wasn't copying `->default_val`, which it needed to

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 19:31

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "it crashed when I made a test…"): fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 19:46

so just gotta handle the actual serialize porting part now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 19:54

can you add a new token to the start for  "version" and set it to 2. If missing assume version 1
only need to bump that when we make a breaking change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 20:11

was just doing that, was gonna default to 1 assuming 0 if missing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 20:37

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "This screenshot shows exactly…"): can you send me your zquest.cfg?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 20:43

...nevermind, grabbed an old build myself

looks like these 3 properties were saved despite that they should have never changed at all
not sure what's up with that @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
(`subscreen_style` was literally a member variable that was never read or written ANYWHERE, so it would have always been default-initialized...)
but these ignore calls should treat them as non-errors

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 20:46

Were you able to get a delta string w/ these in them?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 20:46

yes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 20:46

hmm

this was from a build prior to my refactor
(obviously, as my refactor entirely nuked these unused vars)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 20:47

Does the class do default value initialization, or a user defined "copy / set the world" kinda thing
maybe discrpency there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 20:47

`zinitdata() = default;`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 20:47

maybe try unrolling that part of the macro just for subscreen (if that's feasible...) so you can step thru debugger
or just break at top and inspect the memory

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 20:48

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "maybe try unrolling that part…"): would need to go back to old branch
I just had an old build that I grabbed that from, I don't have the source open at that point rn
definitely something odd there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 20:49

oh uh

took the old data and ran it through, so top is input bottom is output

btw do you see the same odd "this didn't even change..." w/ the current impl?

freshly generated with nothing changed from the default qst

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 21:01

which, plenty of these are the full default values (`hp_per_heart=16`,`magic_per_block=32` just offhand)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2023 21:06

so, I'll leave fixing that oddity to you
but I should have the versioning part done

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 04:04

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "looks like these 3 properties…"): Actually, this was my intention when I wrote this feature. I forgot. For _replays_ it only serializes changes relative to the real init data, but for the Test feature it serializes the delta from a default zinitdata. The idea was to keep it totally separate from the quest's actual init data so that changes to that would not impact a testing configuration.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 05:36

ahk
then the issue here is just that you didn't account for unused junk that never should have been stored in the first place
...which is simple enough to ignore on loading an old init data, as I already set it to
I just hadn't accounted for that when upgrading the init data

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 04:47

...so, anyway, given that this was intentional, and the issue is fixed, closing
