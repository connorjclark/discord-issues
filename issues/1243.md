Note: I presume this would work like the Conveyor combo extension where if you check a flag, they all run the same code. Making the Left, Center, and Right Statues functionally the same class
Rename the combo type: Spawn Enemy/Shooter

Already planned
I want to do an entire overhaul of this combo
let you choose what weapon it fires, what direction or angle or if it's aimed, how many it fires, how often, the chance for it to fire
etc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/09/2021 03:43

Also let it be attached to FFCs and have the enemy move around with the FFC if it doesn't already do that

Attributes:
-Is New (flag, tells it to use these new properties)
-What enemy to spawn (0-511)
-Spawn type (Instant, Puff [default Z1 puff], Blink [Armos/Grave Ghini], Use Enemy's Spawn Animation [for if the user, well, set a custom spawn animation that they want it to use])
-Spawn Offset X (-256-255 should be enough for scriptless users)
-Spawn Offset Y
-Requires Screen To Have Shooting Statue Screen Flag To Spawn (as the title says. Most users would want this off for convenience. But it's required for compatibility, and scripters can use it to do a sneaky quick difficulty increase by having the hard difficulty mode set the Statues Shoot screen flag to always be on, and have some statue combos only shoot if that flag is on aka in hard difficulty.)
I was reminded of this with the #1200 discussion. It would be nice to be able to always spawn an enemy in a certain spot when you enter the room so you always have something to switch spots with.
And of course, custom (the default ZC projectile-shooter enemies now as combos) and scripted npc statue combos.
So one doesn't have to waste room enemy slots or FFC slots to spawn statues other than fireball.

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "let you choose what weapon it…"): i wonder if those settings should be reserved for the enemy
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Also let it be attached to FF…"): i don't believe it does at least for statues with pushblock flags

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/09/2021 04:05

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i wonder if those settings sh…"): I feel like combos makes more sense
Cause then you can just only have one enemy
but multiple combos

=== @ P-Tux7 12/09/2021 04:06

at the same time, altering those settings via script would either require sending commands to both the combo and npc script to update the mutually-exclusive combo and npc properties, or having them communicate

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/09/2021 04:06

NPC would always be reading off the combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/09/2021 04:06

. . . why would you need to update it on both?
the combo spawns the enemy as soon as the screen is entered
so either you modify the spawned enemy
or you modify the combo for the whole quest
I don't see much need to do both

=== @ P-Tux7 07/17/2022 16:47

Yoo #2 got added! I never saw it in the patch notes... did I miss it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/17/2022 16:48

...are you sure that wasn't added before you requested it?
I feel like Zoria did that

=== @ P-Tux7 07/17/2022 16:50

wait never mind, someone mistook armos combo for statue combo
i'll double-check later today
he did indeed add customizable armos enemy IDs
but what i mean is like, the shooting fireball statues
you have all these shooter-type enemies in the default tileset but you have to waste screen enemy slots on them and place them via flags, blegh right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/17/2022 16:57

ah, yeah, I see
