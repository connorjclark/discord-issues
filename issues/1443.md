So when you press the L key in ZQuest the room goes dark to preview what it would look like. Torch combos should also activate in this preview.

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) feel like doing fancy shit?

it needs to basically just run the new darkroom code there on the qr
but like
only in preview mode

...this
this fucking
oh my
this is going to be a LOT more work than expected
pretty much ALL of the new darkroom code is in ZC-only areas
and won't work in ZQ with a copy-paste

getting that to respect preview mode was an extra step
but that certainly seems to work
