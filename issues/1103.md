A DMap setting or flag that let's you adjust whether Player autowalks 0, 1, or 2 tiles. Then a per screen flag or setting that allows you to turn auto-walk off for a specific edge

this could be dangerous when it comes to shutter doors since link needs to autowalk so he doesn't get stuck inside the door

Well the idea would be 2 tiles is the traditional push needed for Classic NES shutters, and 1 for free form shutters/doors, etc., and 0 for no push
