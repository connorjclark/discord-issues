The two blocks to explode when I step on the green button.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:17

how are you exploding them
screen secrets?

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:18

I'm using a sprite decoration sfx.  I'm gonna show you the results in the player that it shows cset 0.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:18

err...
how does the combo
change
I don't care about the explosion effect

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:18

I'm using secret combo flags

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:18

ok
make sure
that you set the secret combo
in the secret combos menu
to the correct cset

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:18

I'm gonna show you the results in the player.
hang tight...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:19

show me the secret combo setup in ZQ
because that's 99% what's wrong

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:21

I'm using the "transition" combos for the explosion sprite effects than cycles to the broken blocks.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:21

ahk, so it's a cycle
show me the combo cycle setup then

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:22

Here is the results.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:22

yeah doesn't matter
you said it was wrong cset seeing it doesn't help
the zq setup is all I need to see

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:22

This is the secret combo setup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:22

k, that looks right, so the cycle is the problem

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:24

the two blocks are the "always triggered" for the explosion sprite.  Then it cycles to cset 0 whether I have "cycle ignores cset" on or not.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:24

screenshot of the cycle setup is all I need to tell you exactly what's wrong
oh?
Even with cycle ignores cset?
That's odd
can I please
see the setup

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:25

Yeah...

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/999137623559905352/999139884155543704/unknown.png?ex=65e7d407&is=65d55f07&hm=cee40d26b4b60f34b9e29a56beb2f571a38906c6f0af24a065e2e0ea24dda77e&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:25

sorry if I seem a bit blunt, just trying to do a lot of things very quickly at the moment, so trying to be quick

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:25

ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:26

so, that combo is the one that it turns into after the secret?
and cycle ignores cset DOESN'T work?
because that's exactly what I would suspect is wrong here

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:26

I'll test the ignore once more...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:27

I added that checkbox specifically for this situation
if it doesn't work then there's a bigger issue here somewhere

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:27

It doesn't work with the ignore cset on as well.
When I leave the screen and go back, it shows the correct cset I want it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:27

can I have the quest file?
...what???
You're using the `Skip cycle on screen init` flag, I presume?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:30

...OH, I think I see the issue

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:30

Ok, I turned off the "Cycle combo on screen init" and it will stay at cset 0 and replay the sprite decoration fx on screen re-entry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:32

bleh
surprised I never caught this before
it's some sort of weird memory shit going on

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/999137623559905352/999141925032579174/zelda.exe?ex=65e7d5ee&is=65d560ee&hm=208dc359467c47cfc615bfd94c91996cb26f64de4fa53bf345f61b8e91ea3e6d&
Does that work?
(should have cycle ignores cset on, still)

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:33

downloading...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:34

sorry again if I was a bit rude

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:34

That's ok

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/999137623559905352/999142454559264851/unknown.png?ex=65e7d66c&is=65d5616c&hm=c0bc62d89bc65ed7408009de4e2463fc1dabfbfe3728f93c8cd7f23ce226bcfb&)
All I did was replace the one you uploaded over the old zelda.exe.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:36

err
were you using 32bit or 64bit

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:36

I was using the 64 bit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:36

bleh
I don't build 64bit
the only way to get 64bit is to push through github and run it's build script for 30 minutes
or I need to set up an entire second buildchain
....probably simplest if you grab the latest 32 bit build, and add the exe I gave to that

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:37

ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:37

(...I really NEED to get a 64bit chain set up, which shouldn't be that hard, just, time consuming)

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:39

I only see the 64 and 86 bit for the windows version in Github.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:39

`x86` is not `86 bit`, it's `32 bit`
...why, I have no clue

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:39

Ok.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:40

`x86 architecture` is just the thing that runs `32 bit`
...always confused me

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:43

It still goes to cset 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:44

huh
wtf
what layer are they on, 0?

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:45

Yes.
There are no layers used in the quest.

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:47

Map 4, 6B

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:50

...err
according to my prints
nothing is combo cycling at all there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:53

. . .
Unchecking `Trigger Singular Secret` fixes it
but
it still doesn't
trace anything
so it's still NOT cycling?
what the fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:56

....oh
you're using the `->Next` trigger
so yeah, this has absolutely nothing to do with cycling
because you aren't using cycling
at all
The `Trigger Singular Secret` is NOT something you want checked here
because that's replacing the combo with a secret combo of some sort
the only reason it isn't blanking out completely to combo 0
is because `->Next` overrides the combo ID back to normal

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:57

Unchecking singular secret fixed for me. thanks so much for your time, you are so helpful!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:58

Doing JUST that also stops the SFX from playing though
You want to use `Change Combo` on the generic combo
*INSTEAD* of the `->Next` trigger flag

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 02:58

Yeah, but when I check "Change combo" It give back the SFX.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 02:58

yeah, exactly
`Change Combo` does `->Next` for you
so you don't need `->Next` checked
....`Generic` combos are a damn mess

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 16:06

Generic combos are one of those nightmares I'm hesitant to touch
I have no idea how I'd clean them up
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) if you have any ideas on how to clean them up, feel free

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 17:49

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) if you…"): I mean, deleting them would be a lot cleaner....
but also break quests that used them

=== @ cbailey78 07/20/2022 22:35

I am so glad that generic combos got implemented. I unlocks so much flexibility and potential.  If it weren't for generic combotype, we would get bombarded with feature requests.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:47

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I mean, deleting them would b…"): Generic combos aren't completely deprecated

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:48

bush combos, for example, will always be triggered by sword regardless, so if you want a bush that does the bush effects but isn't cut by the sword, you can't with a bush, but you *can* with a generic combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:49

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "bush combos, for example, wil…"): nooope

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:49

wait what do you mean by nooope

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:49

You can make bushes not cut by sword
now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:50

what the fuck
okay
can you do custom breaking effects like Generic combos could?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:50

yep, bushes have had that for quite a while

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:50

do they *work* though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:51

pretty damn sure they do
it's the same code as generics use

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:51

hmm
okay, what else is unique to generic combos...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:52

spawning enemies
offhand, that's unique
...won't be once I add armos combotype effects though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:53

Triggers don't have a flag to kill the weapon when it triggers it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:54

That's fair, should add that
good idea

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:56

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...won't be once I add armos…"): you also wouldn't be able to mix and match, say, a grass cutting effect with an enemy spawn
(for enemies hiding under bushes)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:57

true
could add that to bushes
fairly easily

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/20/2022 22:59

On one hand, a feature complete triggers tab could just completely deprecate bushes and flowers and tall grass
on the other, it's not as user friendly to do so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 22:59

Things that aren't checkboxes in triggers take extra memory on combos
we have room for >30 more checkboxes without expansion, though
thus far buttons, item required, and timer added 3 bytes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 23:01

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "You can make bushes not cut b…"): this also affects all combo types that 'trigger' on their own
so, a stairs combo with that checked won't warp you when you step on it

=== @ cbailey78 07/21/2022 00:02

@emily You Rock!
