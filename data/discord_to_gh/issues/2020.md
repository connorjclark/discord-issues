I'm a bit stumped. If you go frame by frame in the video (in VLC, press E on your keyboard), you can see that the palette changes a frame too late when scrolling left and right. It's minor, but noticeable enough that it bothers me (and another user complained about it too). I don't know *why* it's delayed though, as far as I can tell the code should work...

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) any clue? The code is in title.cpp, function is select_game
I'm probably dumb and missing something; at least I hope so and hope that it's not a more complicated thing
It's noticeable when it switches from the eyeball icon to link, it'll have a weird red color scheme for a single frame

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 18:14

No idea, haven't looked yet but can you find the first alpha this started in?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 18:14

Sure thing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 18:15

Mainly wanna rule in or out the a5 display thread

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 18:20

problem exists in 108

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 18:21

does not exist in 107

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 18:24

gonna see if I can get more specific

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 18:37

I plan to make a script to download prebuilt nightlies to bisect very quickly. One day

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 19:29

Traced back to the very first nightly after allegro 5
so it appears to be an a5 issue
fuck.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 22:12

there's some function in a5_display.c related to palettes. Set a breakpoint there... Does it hit during these couple frames?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 14:51

sorry, got distracted

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 15:09

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) it seems to hit while the palette is weird?

(put it at the end of the function so all the code would presumably have run)
The weird thing is that it's inconsistent
sometimes it changes over to the first page with the wrong (second page's) palette, while other times it stays on the second page with the right palette

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/11/2022 15:18

I'm working on moving away from the "display thread" and trying to make all the scaling / window code better right now... I'm thinking the first bit might be related to this.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 15:27

oooh

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 15:29

I'm noticing that the palette it's trying to pass in seems correct

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 15:31

don't know why it wouldn't be updating it correctly though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 15:33

wait, hold on, might have a hunch

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 15:43

I... think I fixed it?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 15:45

it was kinda stupid
```static void a5_display_set_palette(const struct RGB * palette, int from, int to, int vsync)
{
    if (vsync)
    {
        a5_display_vsync();
    }
    a5_palette_from_a4_palette(palette, _a5_screen_palette, from, to);
}```
before
```static void a5_display_set_palette(const struct RGB * palette, int from, int to, int vsync)
{
    a5_palette_from_a4_palette(palette, _a5_screen_palette, from, to);
    if (vsync)
    {
        a5_display_vsync();
    }
}```
After
it being vsync related also explained why it was so inconsistent

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 15:47

it would sometimes draw the screen before changing the palette, and then redraw it again at the end of the frame, which meant a brief window where it was drawn with a wrong palette

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 15:49

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) pushed the fix

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/11/2022 21:36

Nice, good find.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/11/2022 21:38

So the main thread was setting a palette, which involved first waiting for vsync. But the render thread would just render with whatever palette was there and then emit a vsync emit a frame late
no idea why allegro legacy dude even put a vsync there

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2022 23:22

should the vsync there be removed? Seems like it could cause stuff to draw early if you do a palette call

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/11/2022 23:44

I wouldn't bother changing anything, I'm doing a lot of refactors here right now.
not sure if needed or not tho with current master code. See anything wrong commenting it out?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/12/2022 02:06

I imagine it's probably not needed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/12/2022 19:29

I commented it out and nothing immediately seems to break
I'll test some quests with it commented out, but I think having it commented out is probably more fluid

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/13/2022 19:04

seem to be fixed, so closing this
