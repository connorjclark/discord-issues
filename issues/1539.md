I'm sorta running into a issue where the fire gleeock's animation is borked in my untitled project. admittedly it could be something to do with quest rules but the Gleeock 1 animate just fine. I have tried completely moving Gleeock 2's tiles elsewhere and I end up having to fix it up like so.

If you wish, I could DM you my quest file so you can take a closer look.

@ FireSeraphim Check Data 2. Neck offset 1 is the tile offset from the main gleeok's tile (what you have selected as the gleeok's tile) that the Neck's tiles start at. Neck tiles use 4 frames of animation. Neck offset 2 is the offset from *that* that each subsequent neck tile uses (allowing you to have a unique tile per neck). For example, a Neck Offset 2 of 20 would mean each neck segment would use the tile one row down from the last.
I want to say you want a neck offset 1 of 40, and a neck offset 2 of 20 (or 0 if you are fine with the necks being all the same tile)

is that segment near the body supposed to have such a high render priority? I mean I appreciate your help and it has helped to fix gleeock 2 so that it renders properly in my side project but I can't help but to pin some question marks on that neck segment near the body in both cases
