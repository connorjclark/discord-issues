ZC version: Current Nightly (3/24/22)
Items of Itemclass 255 are removed from the player's inventory immediately if running in test mode. If set via the cheat menu the item is removed right after exiting the cheat menu.

. . . how the actual fuck
all test mode does is SKIP the fucking title screen
most of the test-mode bugs have been things that are handled in the titlescreen function NOT happening

OK, thought so
it has nothing to do with test mode
....this is happening in normal mode too.

I just cheated in both `Amulet 1` and `Amulet 2`
but `Amulet 1` is itemclass 255
...it didn't even print the `Gained item` message
OH

that uhh
sure is checking if the itemclass is NOT 255

....OH
FFS
Which traces back to 1.92 compat bullshit
BUT new compat shit was added
to make it use `itype_misc` instead of `0xFF`
and that was never updated
