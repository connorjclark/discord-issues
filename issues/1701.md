Name says it all.
My quest is big on story and intractable npcs so I naturally came across it when I'm making new strings.
Idk if it just be my quest that is having the problem but I can send it over if needed.
The bug is present as of alpha 107.

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/03/2022 18:44

Bump

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/04/2022 00:27

The quest in question:https://github.com/Tabletpillowlamp/ZC-Rosemaster
Open the quest on zquest and create a new string, Zquest will lag for a few seconds before it crashes.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/04/2022 00:45

Me or someone else would look at this eventually, no need to bump. Thanks for providing the quest file

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/04/2022 00:46

I think I may find the culprit

This is in std_constants
Could this be the reason?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/04/2022 01:39

No, that has nothing to do with anything
Nor would it likely be anything in std

=== @ P-Tux7 07/04/2022 02:46

It would be in the ZQuest code right? Not the included ZC scripts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/04/2022 03:24

^

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/05/2022 03:42

Oh I see, is it just some bug?
Since the actual limit should be 65519, right?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 03:43

I just started looking into this.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 03:50

probably unrelated... but it crashes when the file is selected to load but before it even loads (just after choosing it in the file dialog selector)... but only your qst file... üëÄ

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 03:51

jk it's any, just random, hmm

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 03:59

as for the string bug:

it doesnt crash when I make more, but when I save and reload all the strings are gone except the ones I made
so.... be careful üôÇ
hope you do backups

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 05:06

found it

this is why üåà `std::vector` exists

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 05:09

hm... although it is expanded to the proper size before the strings are read... so its something else

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2022 05:10

oh, hmmm
it reallocates the memory when it tries to make the new one
because it only allocates enough for 4096 to start

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 05:18

i get this when I load the qst file, make some strings, and re-open the qst file. But not if I do the same but close the program before loading the qst file again

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 05:19

no fucking idea what fix_string_list is for

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 05:28

ok so the strings are being read (i see values being written to MsgStrings in readstrings) but when I go to the Strings window it's all `(none)`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 05:54

it's something to do with msglistcache
i'm giving up though

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/05/2022 06:10

I see, thanks for helping moving forward this problem.
Yeah this quest might be too ambitious for my own good. 
I still have hopes this will work out tho.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 19:28

what is the purpose of msglistcache
does it need to be cleared or something when the MsgStr array is expanded??

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2022 19:32

<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>
I think it has something to do with the sorting
Because you can manually re-order strings, without changing their index

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 19:38

why, just to organize things better without the screen datas changing?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2022 19:38

Yep

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 19:38

got it.
any problem with just updating all the screen datas when you do move a string?
always good to kill caches
esp when they make bugs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2022 19:50

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "any problem with just updatin‚Ä¶"): And all the script files that are external and can't beupdated?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 19:51

oh do scripts often reference strings
hmm
i guess in that case strings should have labels :/
but too late for that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 20:19

not a real fix, but will be good enough I think. pushed the bug to happen at 8192 strings üòõ

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 20:21

going afk now but @ Tabletpillow you can get a fixed version to test out in about 20 minutes when this build finishes https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/actions/runs/2618659587
it'll be posted here https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/05/2022 20:23

Thank you!

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/05/2022 20:30

I think 8192 would be enough for me but wondering if there will be plans to further expand that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2022 20:30

I mean, it should be able to go to 65535 once the bug is actually fixed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 20:30

It's a bandaid.
Honestly if it happens again probably will just bump it again
The only reason not to go to Max is that it's a lot of memory
Well kind of a lot

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/05/2022 20:34

Oh yeah I can see that.
One question, is it possible to access a file where you could edit all the strings through an external text editor like notepad?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2022 20:36

The problem is that strings are not just text, all the formatting info is in there too

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 20:39

Not in the easy way you probably want
But if you know python... Lol

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/05/2022 20:50

I know a bit of python, I would be interested.
Is the file accessible?
for the non-dev user?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 20:51

(replying to @ Tabletpillow "for the non-dev user?"): Not at all
https://github.com/connorjclark/zquest-data

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/05/2022 20:52

Ah I see.
Thanks again for the zquest file!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 20:52

See examples folder
Release is done let us know if it crashes

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/05/2022 21:01

Yeah I'll test this out when I get home.

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/06/2022 15:52

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) One thing, how do you test out the new build? I don't see a zquest file on github. Do I have to make it?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2022 16:02

https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2022-07-05

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/06/2022 16:11

Thanks!

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/06/2022 16:59

The strings worked!
But the midis do feel like they have some slowdowns. Not sure if that's an error caused by that fix.

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/06/2022 17:42

Oh yeah, and also scripts crashes. Maybe this would require a new thread.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/06/2022 17:52

Yes... this is done.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/04/2022 03:25

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíZquest crashes after making 4095th string.
