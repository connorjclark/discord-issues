Can we have a flag on bush combos which allows a bush to drop its item only once until the player respawns or exits the level? This replicates item drop behaviour in A Link to the Past where most pots drop an item only once until you exit the map or respawn.
Here this will prevent players from endlessly farming drops and health from those pots.

this would require 176 new states per screen

Acknowledged.
176 flags per screen seems quite a lot

Might be best off left to script
