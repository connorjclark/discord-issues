Previously, pressing F12 or Z would take a screenshot of the tile page. This function no longer works
What the heck happened with the tile editor? Feels like several bugs have been introduced but there's no new features.

Okay so I tested more
Screenshotting in ZQuest is broken, period

hmm
Try this for me

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 02:00

Er
No, wait, nevermind

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:00

create a folder named `snapshots`

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 02:00

They got in a screenshots folder now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2022 02:00

oh
you just didn't see it
yeah
that'd be it
Deedee just had so much clutter in her folder when screensharing
and I just needed to do something about it

=== @ Russ 02/17/2022 02:01

lol
I... have mixed feelings on this, but whatever
"Bug" fixed

(meta) thread name was changed: ❌🔒Screenshotting tile pages is broken
to be fair, it looks like I forgot to note it in the changelog post
