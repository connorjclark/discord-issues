I just got the latest alpha today and if you **left** click on one of your favorite combos it will set it to the the current one.

And if you right click on an empty combo in the favorite combos, nothing will happen.

And also apparently, **right** clicking on one of your favorite combos will allow you to select it. But it will also open up the menu.
idk if anyone else uses those. But I use favorite combos constantly.

Oops, that'd be combo pool addition related
