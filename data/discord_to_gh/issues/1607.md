When Deedee updated bridge combos to respect solidity map + effect square, it doesn't seem that change was reflected in the solidity preview draws. If I have a bridge that's half solid with a full effect square, it will draw as if it's fully walkable. Not a super big deal but makes testing setups a bit more awkward as I've got to walk around in the player to ensure I got it right. 

Also I'd assume this should keep the current behavior when the Old Bridge Combo Behavior rule is on. If such a thing is possible
