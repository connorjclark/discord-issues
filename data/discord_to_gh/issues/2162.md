If you change a combo ID (via `SetLayerComboD()` or `templayer->ComboD[]`, for instance), future reads to `templayer->ComboD[]` or usage of `GetLayerComboD()` will not reflect the change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2023 04:51

Are you mixing the two methods?
`GetLayerComboD()`/`SetLayerComboD()` are outdated and deprecated
they work in very jank ways
so, the only bug to report with them is a compat one
(those also don't just write to the temp layer, they write to the temp AND PERM layers)

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 04:52

nah, in fact I'm only using temporary mapdata.  I only tried those std functions because I was curious if they'd work and they don't
this is how I'm modifying the combo -
```mapdata tempLayer = Game->LoadTempScreen(comboLayer);
tempLayer->ComboD[comboPos] = PBRACE_BLANKCOMBO;```
(PBRACE_BLANKCOMBO is 1)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2023 04:53

oh, wait
nevermind
those std ones
...just call the templayer mapdata now.
forgot that I updated it

ahk, so temp layer writes are having issues

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 04:54

and when I do future reads it just gives the original ComboD as placed in editor
(this is tested in the latest Feb. 5 nightly and as far back as a110)

uhhhh

seems to work fine for me

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 04:58

hmmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2023 04:58

How exactly are you setting it

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 04:58

I am writing/reading from different scripts? Maybe that's doing something

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2023 04:58

how exactly are you reading it back

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 04:59

I'm setting it from an item action script (custom Power Bracelet)
and reading it from a screendata script some time later

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2023 05:00

Can you post the exact code that's doing both the reading and the writing

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 05:00

yeah sure

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 05:02

```mapdata tempLayer = Game->LoadTempScreen(comboLayer);
tempLayer->ComboD[comboPos] = PBRACE_BLANKCOMBO;```
note here that the comboLayer can change but is acting on layer 1 in this instance, and changes the combo to combo ID 1
```if (tempLayer->ComboD[77] != PBRACE_BLANKCOMBO) liftedTracker[5] = 1;
Trace(tempLayer->ComboD[77]);```
the screendata script is hardcoded to check for a specific set of combos in this room that can be lifted

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2023 05:03

...assuming that second `tempLayer` is loaded the exact same way

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 05:03

so that's why it's checking combo pos 77 specifically

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2023 05:03

and that you are not leaving and re-entering the screen between the write and the read
I would check your other scripts for a script interfering

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 05:04

let me see if I can isolate this out in a fresh save file

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 05:11

oh fuck asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf
this is not a bug lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2023 05:11

What were you doing

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 05:11

I was lifting the wrong combo on the test screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2023 05:12

pahahahaha

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 05:12

I was testing at combo pos 77 in the script but was actually lifting at pos 82
jesus
yeah all working now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/06/2023 05:12

ahk lol
glad that's sorted

=== @ mitchfork 02/06/2023 05:13

Yup ty
