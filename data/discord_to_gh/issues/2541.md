Have push blocks on layer 2, set the room to have the lense reveal layer 2, can see blocks without the lense

- Proper bugfix: Make pushblock sprite layer draws conditional based on the appropriate layer visibility flags. (Compat rule required).
- Easy fix workaround + general nice feature anyway: Add QR to disable pushblocks drawing on sprite layers (also needs to make the sprite pushblocks draw on the normal layer timings for their `blockLayer` value)
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "- Proper bugfix: Make pushblo…"): ^Implementing both of these would probably be good. The bug here is 2.50.2, so, not new, low priority.

Bump, I see it is a low priority so no worries

@ Deathrider So, fixed this as much as you need it

new QR `Pushable Block Sprite Layer`, default on for old quests. If you UNCHECK it, then pushblocks won't do any special sprite draws AT ALL, and will draw normally as part of the layer they are placed on.

...and also should have patched the blocks not obeying the lens hiding in general.
I didn't compat rule this, because, it was NOT an issue in prior versions- as until my recent lens changes, layer 0 couldn't be hidden, and previously, blocks couldn't BE on layers other than 0.
just hope no replays made use of this specific combination of features
Do note that this fix would NOT fix the actual block draw *while the block is in motion*- though unchecking `Pushable Block Sprite Layer` WILL fix that.
