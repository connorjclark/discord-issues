It appears the Bottle itemclass does not account for large item tiles.

It is a fixed +AFrames tile, regardless of the item's Tile size

Also bonus oddity (unsure if this is a bug):
Only the tile of the first item ID of a given level of bottle is shown on the active subscreen. If you have multiple of the same level the second bottle tile is not shown on the active subscreen.
They display on the Passive subscreen when selected.

blehg
large items are... blehg
and, technically you are not supposed to have more than one of the same level of an item as far as ZC is concerned

Mhm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/13/2022 12:45

so I'm guessing that is subscreen-fucky
generally, you'd solve this by... making them not the same level
the whole idea of bottles means they should all basically be set up identically, so, just making their level be which bottle they are in order is simple enough

=== @ Orithan 04/13/2022 12:46

Their slot is set independently
This oddity persists through Item Override

OK so
(replying to @ Orithan "It appears the Bottle itemcla‚Ä¶"): fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 15:52

(replying to @ Orithan "Also bonus oddity (unsure if‚Ä¶"): This isn't what's happening for me, at least not quite
what seems to be happening is, if you own either item, it thinks you own both
it's displaying the right tiles for each, though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2022 15:54

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "what seems to be happening is‚Ä¶"): err, if you own the lower item ID number item
not either
Also, that issue doesn't look like it's related to bottles, that's just something broken outright. And the correct code is there, but commented out. I feel like someone fucked something up here

OK
Fixed, and did some more
There's now a compat rule for 'old selectors'
and with that unchecked, it will attempt to stretch the selector to the item size
uses the hitwidth/height/offsets for precise pixel measurements, respects size on both the selector and the selected item

Oh, also

Preview in the item editor now accounts for size
If you change the size, you need to click `Refresh Preview` to reload it; size information needs to be known when creating the dialog, so it needs a manual reload to resize it.

aaaand

You can now select what contents to preview, if the itemclass is set to Bottles
