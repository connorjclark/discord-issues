This is a weird one. I have a side view screen to allow the player to swim and fall down a waterfall. It was functioning circa 2019, however the feature randomly broke, causing the player to be boxed in after returning to the original overworld screen. Upon inspecting the combo solidity, the solid combos from layer 1 on the sideview gravity screen carries back to the original screen, without secret combos, combo carryover, or screenstate carryover. Deedee and Moosh watched me demonstrate the issue.

(replying to @ Phosphor "This is a weird one. I have a…"): "Without Combo Carryover", you say?

your, uh, checkbox begs to differ
...unchecking fixes the issue.

I could have sworn I explicitly checked that???

Did you look at it on the correct screen?
(It's checked on the dummy screen, on the warp back to the main screen)
