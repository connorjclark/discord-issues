About ZQuest documentation
combos.txt is missing explanations of Always Triggered and Triggers Secrets in the Generic Combo Triggered By [2] tab
i wonder what that first one was intended for actually... i know one of you two added it

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:29

"wand moves" flag for wands???
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) please add the tooltip if you know

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/15/2021 23:30

oh fuck, I added that v.v
Basically, it makes the weapon's movement pattern apply to the wand, not just the weapon it fires

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:33

wait, are those in yet? or are they just placeholder still

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/15/2021 23:34

So, uh
they weren't placeholder when I added them
But they were wand only
and also they were really bad
coming from... 3 years? 4 years ago?

=== @ P-Tux7 12/16/2021 00:01

oh was this from the like
"clone wand" era

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/16/2021 00:19

yeah
the wand of wondor or whatever the fuck Zoria wanted to call it

This was the first ever thing I did as a """ZC Dev""" (AKA not even contributor yet)

=== @ P-Tux7 12/16/2021 05:48

I could take or leave most of the weaponry (I'm much more interested in switch rod/switch magic due to the puzzle possibilities with [pushable] mirrors) but i really love those books
both a homing lweapon fire and a homing reflected fireball at the very least would be great

_watches 3 minutes of the wand killin' it with fiyuh_
***DO WANT.***
:O
(as a script, anyway...would be too much work to build that all into the engine. :p)

=== @ P-Tux7 12/16/2021 19:52

i'm pretty sure books have quite a few attributes and flags left

=== @ P-Tux7 12/16/2021 19:54

(the only other thing you'd need to expand the "book" for is the Book of Mudora, and if you want the book to both have fire and Book of Mudora effects, it can be quite easily accomplished once item bundles are added in and you just make a bundle that gives both the fire book and an invisible Book of Mudora [or vice versa])

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/16/2021 20:53

(replying to @ 4matsy "(as a script, anyway...would…"): This video is entirely engine stuff! It was also made when I was very inexperienced with the engine
This stuff is still planned, but I want to redo it to be better and not buggy, and port it to things other than the wand

=== @ 4matsy 12/16/2021 21:03

Oh! Well then. Go on with yo' bad self. ^_^
By all means.
I certainly won't stop you, if you actually want to do it all. :p

=== @ P-Tux7 12/17/2021 03:28

uh yeah okay that bug with big armos needs to be in the combo type tooltip
or combos.txt at least

=== @ P-Tux7 03/24/2022 17:15

ffrules.txt needs updating according to Orithan

=== @ P-Tux7 06/02/2022 04:17

```\32 through \126 - ASCII Character. Prints a character based on its ASCII code. For example, \91 allows you to display a backslash.```
https://theasciicode.com.ar/ascii-control-characters/unit-separator-ascii-code-31.html says that the code for a backslash is 92?

=== @ P-Tux7 07/17/2022 17:32

hmm i think it needs to be added to strings.txt or the help file that you can have strings with nothing but string control codes and assign them to notes, signposts, screen string, etc. no visible textbox required
