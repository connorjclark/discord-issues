In-engine save points are limited in functionality and rarely see use. As a result, many quest developers do not use save points and instead develop their quests with F6 in mind. This should be rectified with better in-engine save points.

What would a better save point function like?

Triggerable with triggers tab, so you can then like, `Step->Save` or `Press A Button->Save`
option to heal you

Yes basically that
Interact with a button, have options for healing and mana recharge at the save point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2022 18:35

basically just that really, the triggers tab handles *a lot*

=== @ Matthew 09/25/2022 18:35

that way you could create different types of save points: checkpoints partway thru the dungeon that dont heal you but at least save your progress
versus bigger healing/save points
etc
