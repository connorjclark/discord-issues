A really annoying limitation of ZC is the inability to halt the player and remove the effects of their shield beyond ``Player->Action = LA_ATTACKING``, which has hardcoded limitations like being a fixed 8 frames even if set repeatedly during the animation.
This makes setting up attack animations that don't last that long tedious.
Can we have functionality that makes it not tedious to do, even if you de-hardcode ``LA_ATTACKING``

Does `Stun` stop the shield?

AFIAK no.

I'd probably add a bool for disabling the shield, then
and you can manage it via script
would that work?
you could stun to stop the movement, and then if you set that bool to `(Hero->Stun!=0)` every frame, then the shield would be disabled while you are stunned

Mhm.

Doesn't LA_NONE end the LA_ATTACKING clock when set after it just like it resets it when set before?
I know you can do one after the other to lengthen the animation, assume the inverse would shorten it

Just because it's relevant, if you call
```Hero->Action = LA_NONE;
Hero->Action = LA_ATACKING;```
Every frame, this will circumvent the 8 frame attacking behavior and you'll be in the attacking state indefiniely
This disables shield and movement, too
You can then set back to `LA_NONE` when appropriate to cancel it
I've found this works well enough in my scripts, may be worth trying Orithan

Oh
I can try that then
