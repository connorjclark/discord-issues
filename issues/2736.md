I'm kinda concern about running out of combo slots, can we please double it to 511 combo slots?

no
that's several times harder than increasing the number of items
combo ids are `word`, 16-bit unsigned
and expanding beyond that requires rewriting bits of every single thing in the engine that touches combos

I see...
my apologies
