When editor is left open for a long while while in Options menu the ZC Editor bugs up and causes it to freeze in the menu.  It has never done this before for me as i do not have problems like this. This is like the very first time it's starting to do this and i restarted my laptop, it does the exact same thing again and again.

(meta) thread name was changed: Random Init Data Bug

@ SkyLizardGirl was this the latest nightly at the time?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/07/2022 05:39

You mentioned the Options menu but are showing the Init Data menu. Is it both?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/07/2022 06:06

Yes.*
Also the one before it might do this also.*

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/07/2022 06:10

I asked two questions... Yes to what?
How long do you have to wait
Does it happen if it just sits there or must you do stuff?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/08/2022 02:48

Yes it did.*
or if you open and close the player constantly
to test the quests

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 02:53

I gotta stop asking you two questions at a time...

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/08/2022 03:22

Yes it happened when it sat open for awhile
Going through options and Init data
But I think it’s fixed by now right?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 03:23

Well I didn't change anything

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/08/2022 03:23

Ok

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 03:23

You stopped seeing it?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/08/2022 03:23

I think for now
I will update you when it does it again

Ok it did this again suddenly
The Latest Alpha : (
i was in middle of testing and editing and it got stuck suddenly.
am using the nightly from today.*

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/08/2022 05:07

I just had to use Task Manager to end ZC Editor

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 05:54

The latest alpha is so old
I don't care about bugs from the latest alpha, let us know if it happens in a recent nightly

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/08/2022 22:34

Ok

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/18/2022 01:53

Has anyone else seen this issue?

it Just did it again, this is the current Alpha.
I think it's doing this mostly when i cancel or choose 'test' gameplay.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/18/2022 23:21

currently alpha is nearly two months old
don't report bugs unless you see them on a recent nightly.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/19/2022 20:07

I don’t know understand what does that mean? I updated to the latest nightly.
‘This is’ the nightly.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/19/2022 20:10

I have been using nothing but nightly the whole entire time.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/19/2022 20:17

I never knew you separated the two, I thought it was always the same thing.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/19/2022 20:20

(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl "it Just did it again, this is…"): Don't say this then, most recent alpha is 111 two months ago. 

What's your OS?
Do you know if anyone else sees this?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/19/2022 20:58

I am updating to the new one now, but that was last nightly before the new one now.
And I will see if it does that again.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/19/2022 21:03

Well we didn't fix anything because we never found the issue.
Please answer my questions.
