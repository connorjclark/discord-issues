At some point things in the dialog system got changed around I think. Currently editing FFCs is significantly more tedious because you can't press enter to auto close the dialog. I think enter shouldn't be used for pressing a button selection (space also works for this) and should instead be bound to the OK button in most cases. Similarly esc should cancel the current dialog
