Name. A setting to allow the dmap intro to use a string from the string editor *instead* of the dmap intro box.

Well umm... not exactly. I was thinking more like adding message box support to Dmap intros

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/05/2021 06:12

yeah no
I'm not duplicating all the features from messages to dmaps
that would be weeks of work

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/05/2021 06:13

like just the message box border to dmap intro strings.
and not the whole thing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/05/2021 06:13

just the border, what about portraits, what about shadows, what about textbox size,
what about margins
what about font
if you're gonna request just one piece of that
then the next week someone will be like `wait, why are intro strings missing this?` for something else

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/05/2021 06:14

I see...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/05/2021 06:14

the fact that intro strings are different from normal strings right now, is, frankly, idiotic design

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/05/2021 06:14

then I guess your idea would be better in that case.

=== @ P-Tux7 09/05/2021 06:20

also i'm pretty sure that the dmap intro does not have a wysiwyg preview, so using the string editor would be easier anyways
