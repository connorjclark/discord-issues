Basically the Modify HP option that shallow water gets could be cool as a general option. I can see this feature being used for other things such as hot rooms for example if used on layers.

For hot rooms, you can use:
-Place a damage combo on the screen
-Set it's triggers tab: `ComboType Effects`, `Only Gen Triggers`, `Timer: [how often you want the damage to tick]`,`Req Item: [The item to stop the damage]`,`Invert Item REq`
