If a folder that's the same name as your quest is in the same folder as your quest, there would be a button in the Compile ZScript dialog that "auto-imports" every script file in that folder and auto-compiles them as a global header. This doesn't happen upon LOADING or RELOADING the quest - you have to press the button every time you want to import from that folder. Might be worth having an "are you sure?" box.

Since you have to import all of them every time you compile, this would allow questmakers a neat place to keep track of them, especially if the scripts got updates. Some people have also expressed confusion about writing headers, and this would do it for them.
