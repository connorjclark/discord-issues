=== @ Attempt 08/13/2023 10:48

Been Testing out the SCC's for String Menus and a couple of things i found.
First; moving the cursor to each option seems to be inconsistent with how long you need to press the direction for it to select the next option.
Second; Whenever i open up the string more than once, it seems add an extra line in the middle of the string.

Correction, the string line alignment shenanigans seems to happen with any string, and seems to be caused from reading different strings, like it saves the alignment of the previous read string if that string was one with a menu SCC set up.

I can confirm the inconsistent sluggish cursor movement. I've experienced it too.

What version are you using

> moving the cursor to each option

Is this referring to using arrow keys to change the currently focused input field (button, text, whatever)?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/13/2023 21:22

If so - I see that too.

=== @ Phosphor 08/13/2023 21:23

It's almost as if it's not checking for inputs every frame, so if you press and release between checks, it doesn't detect anything. I'm certain it isn't that, but it feels like the cause of the kind of thing I'd encounter in something I'd haphazardly program for a class or something

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/13/2023 21:24

It's a known class of issue. So it's just the focus change?

=== @ Phosphor 08/13/2023 21:24

yeah
At least the bug I'm encountered. @ Attempt may be referring to something more specific?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/13/2023 21:26

So I can fix that part. Maybe someone else can look into the extra line thing here.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "So I can fix that part. Maybe…"): no no no this isn't in a dialog
this is an in-game feature
not related to your gui changes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/13/2023 21:54

Oh. Still, there are focus issues to fix.

@ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2023 10:57

So fixed the first issue with the input delay. Was really simple. The menu was only updating every n frames where n is the string's current speed. Also it was set to read hold inputs once per 5 frames, probably because of the aforementioned delay. Bumped that up to 20

=== @ Moosh 09/29/2023 13:17

Okay I THINK I've fixed the line spacing quirks as well. What was going on is it was using a value before updating it, causing it to transfer line heights to the next line down. It also wasn't resetting altered line heights when switching strings, causing those to also bug out. I think I've caught every case of this bug, but I'm flagging as "needs testing" because strings are hella confusing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2023 00:57

Is this fixed?

=== @ Moosh 10/08/2023 02:05

Far as I'm aware. I marked it as needs testing since strings be super finnicky. But nobody's come forward, so assuming all's good?

=== @ Phosphor 10/10/2023 17:22

I'll try to test later today

=== @ Phosphor 10/11/2023 03:16

(replying to @ Moosh "Far as I'm aware. I marked it…"): Can confirm

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2023 03:17

Excellent!
