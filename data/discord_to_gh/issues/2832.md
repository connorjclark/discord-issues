It'd be perfect if there were keyboard hotkeys for Quick Assign and Smart Assign (perhaps Q and S respectively)

To speed up compiling scripts and debugging 🙂

(replying to @ Twilight Knight "It'd be perfect if there were…"): There ARE favorite commands
...honestly I want to merge favorite commands with the hotkey system
that would let you keybind anything you can favoritecommand

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/08/2023 17:27

I'm sorry I don't see how favourite commands would help here
I just compile and then want to quick assign, preferably with a hotkey
Or you mean that helpful later once favourite cmds have hotkeys

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/08/2023 17:29

(replying to @ Twilight Knight "I'm sorry I don't see how fav…"): there is a favorite command that compiles and quick assigns
and a favorite command that compiles and smart assigns

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/08/2023 18:38

In one go? 🤩 
Yes that works
Alright that is already much better 👍 
A hotkey would still be much desired, but I guess that's part of the "favorite command hotkey" stuff and this ticket could be closed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/08/2023 22:13

(replying to @ Twilight Knight "Alright that is already much…"): yeah that's exactly what adding hotkeys for all favorite commands would do

(meta) thread name was changed: Merge Fav Commands with Hotkeys

MY GOD THIS IS SO MUCH WORKKK
AAAAAAAAH
***screams in tedium***

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/14/2023 21:55

😂
I can imagine, there's lots of available favourite commands
A suggestion: maybe only map the favourite buttons to a hotkey?

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/14/2023 21:56

So the buttons you'd press normally can also be hotkeyed, you essentially have the same possibilities with less code

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2023 21:56

nonono
the existing favorite commands system is a janky mess
this has been needed for a while, not just because it was requested lol
and it's not like, *difficult* work
it's just *tedious*

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/14/2023 21:57

Alrighty

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2023 23:18

Making progress
a bit under 100 to go
for converting into the hotkey system each command

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2023 23:19

....then I need to
- hook the fav command buttons up to the hotkeys
- design a new gui for picking favorite commands
- still want to redesign the hotkey minding menu to be searchable, especially now with this crap
- should alphabetize it once it's searchable.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2023 03:29

K, got the first bullet point done
except the hotkey menu is crashing now

IT IS DONE

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2023 05:49

(replying to @ Twilight Knight "It'd be perfect if there were…"): which, fullfills your original request

One whole day's work
tedious as fuck
nowhere near as bad as something like the subscreen rewrite though

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/15/2023 11:25

Sickkkkk 👌
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "tedious as fuck"): can imagine that
Btw totally unrelated, I'd still like to help with pimpin the ZC docs
But no clue where the info on that can be found, could you please send me in DM?
I have more time for it now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2023 18:37

(replying to @ Twilight Knight "But no clue where the info on…"): like which, the webdocs?
or like tutorials and stuff?
