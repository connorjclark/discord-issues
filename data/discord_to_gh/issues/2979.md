If I've made changes to the notepad, If I realize that I've made changes that I've regretted, I won't save with Enter/OK.  I'll hit Escape to leave, hopefully without saving any changes.  

Should this be a toggle in the Options area, to have this popup just not appear at all under any conditions?  Or is this a technical limitation and the box must appear, period?

Though I suspect that this will probably not be implemented, as it seems to be settled already.  Fair enough, really.

So, the thing here is, you say you won't hit enter/ok, you'll hit escape... `Enter` won't do a single thing ever though, because that *types a new line in the notepad*, so escape is the only button way to exit the notepad
There also wasn't ever an `OK` before, that was added SUPER newly with the ability to change the color scheme- and clicking `OK` is IDENTICAL to clicking the `X` or pressing `Escape`
generally it seems better to have a confirmation than not, regardless, to be safe; the same applies to the subscreen editor, which warns you about unsaved changes *even if you haven't changed anything*, because detecting if you've changed stuff is a lot of work, and it's better to just have a confirmation regardless.
