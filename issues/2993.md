Oddly enough, not seeing this with Randomizer Omega.
Basically, the crashes are happening randomly, but the following events have triggered a crash multiple times

-Just trying to load up a save file with the quest (Before and after seed generation)
-Picking up objects like rupees

...looks like the crash is somewhere in A5 code, yay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 00:46

the same A5 code spot, being hit by multiple different ZC code spots
(replying to @ RetroNutcase "Oddly enough, not seeing this…"): Which graphics driver are you using, and does changing to a different one fix the issue?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 00:55

I'll add the gfx driver to the debug info added to sentry crashes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 00:56

aye, that'd make sense

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/18/2024 00:57

I'm currently using OpenGL. It's the only one that plays nice with alt tabbing and changing resolution...Most of the time.
Sometimes trying to change resolution crashes too. It's inconsistent.
For some reason ZC is ignoring my resolution settings on launch and always goes to my monitor's max resolution, despite the fact I have the resolution set to 1920x1080 in the config and launcher.
(This is a problem because I use multiple screens, and res changes mess with the window placement)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 01:01

@ Retro Respecter screenshot of your launcher please?
fucking
whoops

im gonna stop typing now because that's 2 brainfarts I've had in under a minute

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 01:02

I don't think any of us have multiple monitors and I don't really know what the expectation is for Windows here. I vaguely understand that it sucks in general and most people need a window management tool to get a good result.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 01:02

oh, also, resolution settings are only for windowed afaik, not fullscreen?
so it wouldn't respect that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 01:04

That's right, fullscreen mode just does the biggest resolution right now.
It hasn't mattered for the application because we just scale everything anyways, we don't have an adaptive UI.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 01:05

which, is what I would generally expect
I can't recall a single program where fullscreen has had res options

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 01:05

I don't understand how changing the resolution of a monitor would make windows move.
Pretty much all games do.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 01:06

? Really?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 01:06

Yea, so I'm surprised you'd say that lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 01:06

well, sometimes for like, scaling reasons
but the window is always.... the whole screen
never have I seen a game where I could set it to fullscreen
and it would... not take up the whole screen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 01:06

Yes, full screen is the entire monitor but the underlying bitmap size for the display is what the resolution is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 01:07

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Yes, full screen is the entir…"): yeah, which like, in our case does not apply
so, in the way *we* use resolution settings
since our resolution is always 256x224

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 01:07

Allegro does have a "ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW" but it's not very portable.
There's also frameles window mode.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 01:07

. . . a "Fullscreen Window" is an oxymoron
Windowed Borderless, yeah, that's common
and often better than fullscreen
in most games
especially re: alt-tabbing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 01:17

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I don't understand how changi…"): Oh right, because he's alt tabbing to minimize zc

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2024 01:19

Yeah, and that always screws with everything
Plenty of times I tab out of something and my discord, which was maximized, is now 1/4 of my screen in the upper left

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/18/2024 01:27

One sec
here's what my launcher looks like
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1197339882469724210/1197351528172900402/image.png?ex=65e91802&is=65d6a302&hm=cfc3fe04a00edd1972eb6def35904a94fda9f540aa70440cd4fde2f3d268041c&)

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/18/2024 01:29

As for the question, well, if I have windows open on my right monitor, when I go from max res to 1080 on my main, they just end up getting moved offscreen somewhere I can't see. Since I use my second (right) monitor to look at stream chat and such, that's...A problem.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 06:02

The fullscreen monitor resolution thing will be fixed in the next release. It seems possibly related to the original crash reported here, so that may be fixed too. Let us know if you see it again after tonight's release.

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/18/2024 06:08

o.o b
Is that stuff related to my crashing on MIrage Island too?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 06:09

The crash trace emily shared above is for bitmap stuff, so it's feasibly related to how the display is created / modified, which is what I changed.
Did you happen to toggle fullscreen mode during that session?
(switching to/from fullscreen)

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/18/2024 06:09

Don't think I toggled any. I might have alt tabbed though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 06:10

In that case, I'm less confident, but let's see.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/21/2024 00:39

@ RetroNutcase have you experienced any further crashes with the new version?

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/21/2024 00:40

Haven't had a chance to try it yet, I'll try to do that tonight

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/21/2024 01:13

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@ RetroNutcase have you…"): https://zquestclassic.com/releases/ nightly from this?

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/21/2024 01:18

Now it just hard locks on randomization with Mirage Island. Fullscreen's no longer an issue at least.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/21/2024 01:19

Hardlock? Does F9 work?

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/21/2024 01:19

F9 works.
Also happening on Omega when randomizing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/21/2024 01:20

F9 working indicates that the script is still running
... Possibly stuck in some infinite loop or something

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/21/2024 01:21

https://zquestclassic.com/releases/nightly-2024-01-20/ is latest 2.55
Did you get 3.0

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/21/2024 01:22

Oh, I got 3.0 I think
Is that not the one I was supposed to grab?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/21/2024 01:23

I assume you'd want to stay on 2.55
and 3.0 is going to have other differences that could be a different problem
So I'l check that separately, but for now stick to 2.55 probably

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/21/2024 01:24

Ah.

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/21/2024 01:28

Okay, everything seems alright on 2.55 nightly so far. I'm trying several save and quit + reloads to see if I get a random crash

=== @ RetroNutcase 01/21/2024 01:36

Yeah, i think this works! o.ob

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/21/2024 18:30

great!
FWIW, the issue w/ 3.0 is resolved too.
