A while back I recall Zoria added a bunch of strange functions that drew screen combo data to a bitmap as color data, supposedly for use with scrolling systems. I figured it'd be handy to use this to autogenerate a solidity minimap for something aaaaaaaaaand they don't fucking work at all.
These ones for reference

The main one I tried was DrawScreenSolid. It worked for map 29 but arbitrarily not for map 28. I have no idea what map number had to do with it, but 28 did not match that map's solidity map at all. I also tried both the  DrawScreenComboFlags and DrawScreenComboIFlags functions, neither of which seemed to work, once again on map 28

...But once again, they seem to work on map 29. So I seem to be narrowing in on some kind of cause

Fuuun

ooof, right
this
@ Moosh got any test quests where the issue exists?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 22:48

oh shit oh fuck
it's crashing the ffc script after a while
that's not good...
oh
oh I see
I'm just a bitmap brainlet lmao

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/07/2022 22:50

Apparently you have to Free it manually, you can't just treat it like other variables...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:02

@ Moosh okay, so I think I already know the answer
but just gonna ask: did the screens in question where it didn't work have a layer assigned?
and the ones where it did work not have any layers

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:03

Oh yeah, sorry I forgot to get back to you on that earlier

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:05

Believe so yes. Specifically 28 was a game map and 29 was one of its layer maps

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:05

yeah then that's the problem
```DrawScreenComboFlags and DrawScreenComboIFlags functions, neither of which seemed to work, once again on map 28``` I'm weirded out that these are inverted

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:06

So what's going on with this then? Layers on the screen causing some kind of offset on what data it's reading?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:08

the layer draws were basically overwriting the draws of the layer 0 draws

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:09

so layer 1 would just replace whatever layer 0 had drawn with it's own shit, even if there's nothing on layer 1
because the bitmaps weren't being masked

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:09

ohh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 00:10

also, the very way this is set up won't work AT ALL for anything but solidity
all of the flag versions won't work

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:10

That's fucking wacky

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:11

Going to deprecate/rewrite the ones that aren't DrawScreenSolid

=== @ Moosh 02/08/2022 00:11

Why would he even use DrawScreen as the basis when writing these instead of DrawLayer ü§¶

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 00:11

the problem is, what if position 0 has a flag on layer 0 and layer 1?
it would only show layer 1's
because it COVERS layer 0's
very fun times

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 00:13

(replying to @ Moosh "Why would he even use DrawScr‚Ä¶"): hell if I know

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 02:56

Fixed with a QR

Has both this + fixed combo scripts (hopefully)
