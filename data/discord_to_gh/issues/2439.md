Tried enabling all compat rules and checking `Allow  Setting A Button Items` but doesn't seem related to either.

Roc's Feather has the same issue. Which I assumed would be the case

Is l/r quickswap enabled?
If so, no bug here

...yup, that was it ü§¶
I went digging with the QR search but I assumed the rule for it would have "button" or "swap" or something of the like in it

Quickswap eats lr presses, yeep
