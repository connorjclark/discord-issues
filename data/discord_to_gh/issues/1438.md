Add tall grass and shallow water sprites to either Misc. Sprites or their respective combos

=== @ vlamart 02/27/2022 22:59

Better idea: move these to a Misc. tab in Player Sprites, a long with the death blink, and if not too much, flash cset options such as what/how many csets to cycle through, or null them out if you set a flash flag to blink

...I thought tall grass and shallow water were *already in* Misc. Sprites. When were they removed? o_O

(Said graphics for said sprites are still in the default tileset on page 101, btw.)

Yeah they should be labelled MISC: blablabla

=== @ vlamart 02/28/2022 03:09

It's not in Quest->Graphics->Sprites->Misc Sprites to assign it, but at least you can edit Sprite 55 and 56

(meta) thread name was changed: Tall GrassShallow Water Per-Combo Misc. Sprite
(meta) thread name was changed: Tall Grass & Shallow Water Per-Combo Misc. Sprite
renamed for better explanation, especially now that the original misconception of thinking they had no misc. sprites at all is resolved

If per combo, would be neat to also have a "match cset" flag to force the sprite cset to match the combo placed's cset
