There are a few item classes that are not documented in ``std.zh`` yet. I'm hoping these can be documented later down the track.
These include Lanterns (``Family: 268``). Curiously that is also the family ID reserved for the Ether Medallion itemclass according to std.zh.

Hmm Emily added it in-between instead of at the end? Not a huge issue. Ether is probably not going to happen in this version as it needs frozen enemies.

```cpp

    /*
    itype_templast,
    itype_ether, itype_bombos, itype_quake, 
    itype_powder,
    itype_trowel,
    itype_instrument,
    itype_sword180,
    itype_sword_gb,
    itype_firerod,
    itype_scripted_001 = 400, 
    itype_scripted_002,
    itype_scripted_003,
    itype_scripted_004,
    itype_scripted_005,
    itype_scripted_006,
    itype_scripted_007,
    itype_scripted_008,
    itype_scripted_009,
    itype_scripted_010,
    */```
these itemclasses, while reserved, were commented out internally
so I ignored them in adding more
none of these are implemented yet, so they don't need constants reserved yet. I didn't realize std_zh had them

@ Orithan it's only lantern, right?
`IC_ATKRING = 267` is already there, so

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:12

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) You can  safelyremove the consts for `itype_templast,` and a after it in <std>
Need to bump the std metadata and version info and make a new branch for it though
You pushed your last change to headers w/o doing that (ghost)
so, I am reminding you that these things exist and for <std> it is critical to always update metadata and push as a branch then merge to master
`std_meta.zh`
Also did you add the lantern to *modues*?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:16

(The module format requires an update with any new item class so that ZQ knows how to label it in the GUI based on the module.)

=== @ Orithan 10/04/2021 08:46

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Orithan it's o‚Ä¶"): So far only found Lantern

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:46

I just re-did the whole list
Now they are in numeric order
Makes it saner
(I'm going to add the number to the dropdowns so it's easy to find if you need it, for, like, init data or something)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:58

ü§∑
the were alphabetic
What about the module data?
P.S. Module data fields are in both ZCP and ZQE

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 09:01

There is a default str literal for eachgroup and each group is sized; then the actual module loading can overwrite the field. You need to increment the number of string fields for itemclasses, add the literal, and add a loading fieldfor the.zmod

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 09:04

I see the module-related code, and know how it works

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 09:07

good enough, then
IDK if you remembered this stuff or not

itype number now prints next to all itemclasses (I `sprintf`'d the module name with the index)
(If people end up disliking this, I can always add a config with a checkbox in options)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 09:21

Why not printf their module class name instead  of the number?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 09:23

same code but %s and the numeric index for the string

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 09:25

. . . ?
Is that not exactly what I'm doing?
```cpp
char const* module_str = moduledata.item_editor_type_names[i];
char* name = new char[strlen(module_str) + 7];
sprintf(name, "%s (%03d)", module_str, i);
```

#deleted-channel new build, fixes this
(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìConstants for undocumented Item Classes

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 09:38

Oh oh I didn't understand. I thought it was printing the class number next to the *item* name
This is printing the class number next to the *class* name.
n/m

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 09:40

aye
