Title. This causes enemies like Zols and Vires to occasionally die in a single hit, because the lingering hitbox of the sword immediately kills the gels or keese that split from the parent enemy.

How does z1 handle this?

=== @ Phosphor 06/07/2023 21:11

Usually they get knocked back far enough to where the sword doesn't immediately kill the split enemies, assuming what you hit them with wasn't strong enough to one-hit kill the parent enemy

=== @ Phosphor 06/07/2023 21:12

Not sure if the keese and gels have invincibility frames, but the way they're behaving in 2.55 makes Zols almost always less threatening than even Gels
same with Vires

=== @ Phosphor 06/07/2023 21:15

Non-tribble Zols should die in one hit to the white sword, tribble Zols and Vires in general should only die in one hit to the magical sword or better

=== @ mitchfork 06/07/2023 21:16

ZC has a lot of (intentional) situations where knockback will not apply, similar to Z1. Specifically if enemies are not perfectly on grid or close to walls
Not to rent-a-dev but might be useful to have a video

=== @ Phosphor 06/07/2023 21:17

Of the bug in action?

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2023 21:18

huh even when zols and vires don't knock back in 2.50 and earlier 2.55 versions, it takes long enough for them to spawn that you can't kill both in one hit
do you have the spawn animation disabled on gels and keese?

=== @ Phosphor 06/07/2023 21:18

I haven't modified them in any way from how they were when I started updating this tileset from 1.92
Let me double check to see it it's happening in another quest

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2023 21:19

i actually DID play a 1.92 quest in 2.55 in january and things seemed normal

=== @ Phosphor 06/07/2023 21:22

It doesn't seem to be happening in another quest, so it seems to be some sort of emergent behavior caused by an unrelated setting or something?
Again, I have not modified any of the stock Z1 enemies

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2023 21:27

yeah video please

=== @ Phosphor 06/07/2023 21:34

This is honestly baffling me

I demonstrate both enemies in two separate quests, both unmodified, both quests having the player use a wooden sword

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2023 21:55

Yeah, the spawn animations seem to be faster in the second one
Check the spawn sprites and the animation speed in the misc sprite editor?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/07/2023 22:29

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "do you have the spawn animati…"): @ Phosphor you did the apply bugfixes, or unchecked compat rules?
or applied any ruleset?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/07/2023 22:31

In that case.... exactly what P-Tux said, check the `Quest->Graphics->Sprites->Sprite Data` sprite `MISC: Spawn` (should be number 22, might be named differently because tileset)
you can lengthen the spawn animation to fix that

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2023 22:32

ah, is the length of the spawn animation now tied to the sprite data, whereas it was hardcoded in 1.92-2.50

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/07/2023 22:32

yep
same for the death animation

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2023 22:33

ah neat

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/07/2023 22:34

shadow as well
(replying to @ mitchfork "ZC has a lot of (intentional)…"): I also believe splitting enemies simply don't have knockback, IIRC
not from the hit that splits them

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2023 22:53

they do if in a situation where they'd ordinarily have knockback
though iirc split upon death enemies don't

=== @ Phosphor 06/08/2023 00:06

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Phosphor you did…"): The quest in PTUX has all NES Buggixes enabled. I think the issue is the hardcoded spawn and death animation frames basically forcing the gels and keese to spawn instantly instead of with a slight delay?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/08/2023 01:19

NES bugfixes are not all the fixes
`Quest->Options->Pick Rule Templates->Bugfix` will apply all ZQ bugfixes
(which, means unchecking the `Compat` rules- though the rule template does some extra stuff to help, so you should use it instead of unchecking them manually)
The frames are NOT hardcoded if the bugfixes are applied
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "In that case.... exactly what…"): meaning you can modify them as previously mentioned

=== @ P-Tux7 06/11/2023 00:37

Have you tested this yet
