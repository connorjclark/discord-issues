Similar format to DrawInteger, except it draws the value in Hex (useful if say you were displaying the palette used and wanted to find it in zQuest). Might be nice if it also came with an option to draw 0 - 15 as 00 - 0F, instead of 0 - F.

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Similar format to DrawInteger…"): probably best to use `sprintf` + `DrawString` for this?

It's what I'm currently doing. Most of the request is the extra bits of control the function would have, along with not needing a string you write the Hex value to.

```cpp
char buf[0];
sprintf(buf, "%02X", num); //00 - 0F
sprintf(buf, "%02x", num); //00 - 0f```
(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "It's what I'm currently doing…"): ah.
