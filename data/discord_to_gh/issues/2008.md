Two weapons lag ZC in the newest nightly, and did not as of 107 (and I believe through 109). Cheat yourself the weapon "Ability B (Asher)", equip from the subscreen, and use it. ZC noticeably lags to around 53 FPS. You can also see this with another weapon if you set CUstom Counter 10 to 17, then give yourself the $Character Rings->Mod(Torrin) and Ability B(Torrin). Equip the item, then hold it til a thought bubble pops up and scroll left until it turns purple. Then use the item. This lags ZC down to about 44 FPS.

repost from the bestiary lag thread:
```Deedee — Today at 10:31 AM
This (Bestiary Lag), the Character Switching, and Stellar Weapons lagging can all be traced back to the "Destructors call on any object destruction" commit 
It appears that mass deletion of objects causes significant lag
Stellar Weapons are obvious as presumably they're just creating 1 frame hitboxes
the other two might not sound obvious, but bestiaries due to an oversight are an equipment non-gameplay item of a higher level that doesn't keep lower items, causing it to remove 30-ish items from your inventory, and character switching changes your currently owned items
Both of these are important, as changing Link's owned items causes the entire subscreen to be rebuilt, including deleting all of the sprites on the subscreen (which presumably would call the destructors)```
