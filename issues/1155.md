Having to scroll through 100+ pages every time you want to edit a tile or choose one for combo, item, sprite or enemy is very annoying.

You're aware of the P hotkey for skipping to a page right?

^ this. Also "open tile page" by right- clicking a combo... including a favorite combo, which you can totally use as bookmarks.
