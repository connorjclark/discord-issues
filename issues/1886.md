Old report: 
#1831

ZC always uses `zc.sav`, regardless of what save file it is configured to use.

Oh, I fixed this in my browser branch.
I'll upstream this commit.
The config is just being written and writes the save file path before the save file global var is ever updated from the config.... so it always resets to the default
