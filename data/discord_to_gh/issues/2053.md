For the first quest in a normal game, looking at the file info correctly displays the playtime for the status, but upon that file becoming a second quest file, the status stays as Time Unknown.  This does not apply to second quest files began using the ZELDA password.

the quest's `timevalid` is getting false for some reason, huh
probably something to do with `inc_quest`

time is invalid when copied at this point

load_quest sets it to false, and nothing ever sets it to true again (only done in register name)
