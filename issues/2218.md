on 2023-3-3 nightly, and also tested on 112, after messing with aliases for a moment, I discovered I was unable to draw anymore normally. I was drawing colorset as if holding shift, without holding shift, When I do hold shift, It allows me to draw as if I was not holding shift. This is the opposite of expected behavior.

resolved, this was a typo by @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
...or a typo in something he copy/pasted without checking, at least

You really don't need to interrupt my evening with a tag for this.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 05:10

ah sorry
...really wish there was a way to add someone to a thread, like, without actively pinging them. That would be useful.

(also didn't realize you got that interrupted by pings, sorry)

Well, I'll just download the next latest when I have time. Glad we could find a bug.
