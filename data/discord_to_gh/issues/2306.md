While I'm suggesting tile editor stuff, would it be possible to have a toggle to enable/disable the grid shown while editing tiles? Pressing the spacebar toggles between two different colors but being able to just have it go away completely would be a nice option. Same with the little "x" drawn over the pixels which are the transparency color, it would be nice to be able to toggle that on/off too. I don't particularly have any hotkeys in mind that would work well but I would be content if it was just a checkbox option.

`Hide Grid` hides the grid (does not hide the quarter grid if that's enabled)
`No X` hides the Xs
`Bg Trans.` will make the standard UI background color appear instead of color 0 for transparent pixels

`Tab` toggles `Quarter Grid`
`Shift+Tab` toggles `Hide Grid`
`Ctrl+Tab` toggles the `X/No X/BG Color 0/BG Trans.`
