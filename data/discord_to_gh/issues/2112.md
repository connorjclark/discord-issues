I assume this QR should fix this, but for 1 frame duing a scrolling warp only my passive subscreen script doesnt run

@ Deathrider something possibly related to this was fixed, could you test again?

=== @ Deathrider 02/24/2023 02:06

will check quickly

=== @ Deathrider 02/24/2023 02:08

Just tried the latest build, still seeing the issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 02:08

ahk, noted

=== @ Deathrider 03/29/2023 04:57

bump

=== @ Deathrider 04/05/2023 04:20

Update to the issue, it is specifically when transitioning between dmaps
diff palettes, same palettes, same issue between dmaps

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/05/2023 04:22

....aaah, interesting

Bump

Bump2

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 04:05

bumping myself
@ Deathrider any chance you can create like a test quest to showcase this issue simply? makes it take a lot less energy to debug stuff
and clearly I've been failing to have the energy for this every time I've seen it, based on the multiple bumps required

=== @ Deathrider 06/02/2023 14:27

If I find the time I will

that seems fun
....also this just includes your main script
....still looks testable though?

=== @ Deathrider 06/04/2023 22:25

Hu, dont remember seeing that in console, I can double check

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2023 22:35

I am so confused
nothing is wrong at all in the scrolling function
like, legit, I step through and breakpoint it, and it draws correctly for all of the scrolling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2023 22:50

. . . I figured it out and I want to tear my hair out
So, your draws are post-waitdraw
....it's running the pre-waitdraw of the script ***before it clears the script and swaps to the new dmap's script***.
Meaning when it clears that, it sets waitdraw to false for that script
<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>

=== @ Deathrider 06/04/2023 22:57

So I need to change when the draws happen in my script?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/04/2023 22:59

no, it's a me problem
it's just REALLY fucking specific
which is why it was so hard to find
....and it looks fixed.
I had to jank hack a fix, but
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
it works

=== @ Deathrider 06/05/2023 00:44

When will the nightly featuring this fix release?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 02:53
