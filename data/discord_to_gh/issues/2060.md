=== @ Deathrider 12/03/2022 07:03

Even with setting 
```cpp
Input->Press[CB_MAP] = false;
Input->Button[CB_MAP] = false;
```
The map continues to reopen after attempting to close it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/03/2022 07:15

Did this work in a previous version?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/03/2022 07:24

yes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/03/2022 07:42

Probably works in A111. I'll fix this tomorrow, seems important. Going to bed now, but a test `.qst` file where this _works_ in A11 (or whatever the most recent alpha it works in...) but fails in recent builds would be very helpful.

=== @ Deathrider 12/03/2022 08:34

it must have broke during the time period between Aug and Oct as I did not do dev then. I will pinpoint the alpha that first broke it

=== @ Deathrider 12/03/2022 08:46

So it last worked in this build:
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2022-10-16-3

So it breaks in this one: 
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2022-10-18
My latest quest version that works with that build: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19zlfC16QQPxxOHWkUE6hFYUCRjD8suyW/view?usp=share_link

=== @ Deathrider 12/03/2022 08:48

hope this is helpful

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/03/2022 08:49

....well, that's a narrow range of builds
with only 8 commits
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/55642cf91f4640e072d92c6101a52da507a49512
one of which involves button input
....but this was cleanly tested and fixed other issues

=== @ Deathrider 12/03/2022 08:50

sounds a tad sus...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/03/2022 08:50

so even if it is the problem, reversion isn't the answer
....or it could somehow not be the problem, which would be interesting
but it's definitely sus

=== @ Deathrider 12/03/2022 08:50

perhaps something used in the script is incompatible?
became incompatible
Here is the script: https://github.com/Deathrider365/TerrorOfNecromancy/blob/demo3/Scripts/EmilyMap.zs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/03/2022 08:59

or
@ Deathrider Does it work if you turn off recording replays?
(need to turn off recording for new saves, then start a new save file)

=== @ Deathrider 12/03/2022 09:08

Just got in bed, will check later
I do have everything I have locally pushed

=== @ Deathrider 12/03/2022 09:12

Although I believe you told me about the replays after I found the bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/03/2022 09:12

ahk

=== @ Deathrider 12/03/2022 18:26

replays do not seem to affect it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2022 01:42

(replying to @ Deathrider "My latest quest version that‚Ä¶"): what dmap/scr would this script run on
If I _hold down_ Map button should I see something

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 01:43

Any dungeon where you have the dungeon map
I think

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2022 01:44

yup
https://github.com/Deathrider365/TerrorOfNecromancy/blob/demo3/Scripts/EmilyMap.zs#L233-L234
were these two line always there
or did the script work w/o?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 01:45

Those were added in debugging
But their addition changed nothing about the behavior
It was bugged without them

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2022 01:56

and `run` supposedly runs when the map button is inputted. where's the code for that?
need to see how it checks the control state
The answer here may be a QR but I'm trying to understand exactly what's happening first

=== @ Deathrider 12/04/2022 02:25

Sorry, go to map 18 pernicious grotto, that is where I was testing it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 06:28

`rPbtn()` in hero.cpp

=== @ Deathrider 12/04/2022 16:44

Whats that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 16:45

the internal version of `->PressMap`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2022 18:03

(replying to @ Deathrider "hope this is helpful"): btw yeah, this is very helpful. This is the platonic (ideal) bug report üòÅ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 18:04

^Aye, you are literally the perfect tester

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2022 05:46

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "https://github.com/Armageddon‚Ä¶"): This commit is the issue I'm 99% sure
issue does not happen in the commit right before this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 05:47

yeah, the question is WHY that's an issue
just reverting that commit is not an option, it's necessary for other fixes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2022 05:49

what's happening with the script is that it's cancelling the map input
which means that as soon as it stops cancelling it, it's gonna get pressed again if it's still held
you can see this happening if you frame advance and only press the map for one frame; it doesn't reopen
why it matters for the onmap script, unsure...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 06:00

...huh, I think I get it
not why it matters for the map script specifically but

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2022 06:05

it matters because you can't close spacebar map with the map button
Which is why it doesn't do it for spacebar map but it does it for Deathrider's script

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2022 06:08

what you did was you made it so when Input is set to false, it wipes out the thing that remembers that it was being held, which means it treats the next read of the button as a press instead of a hold

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 06:09

yeah, I see. Think I have a fix you can try
or rather, I should probably just finish what the fuck I was in the middle of so I can push

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2022 06:10

hope I helped figure it out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 06:46

Thank fuck
fixed @ Deathrider @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
That `down_control_state[]` thing wasn't patched properly
my fix fixed cases where it wasn't setting false properly
.....but failed to fix cases where it wasn't setting *true* properly
@ connor I bumped VERSION for replays and compat-checked it the same way you did for the last one

=== @ Deathrider 12/05/2022 06:59

Yay, awesome!
Thanks a lot yall!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 07:00

This was yet another fairly major issue you caught for us
and it seems like it might also be a duplicate cause of #2043
both input-related issues

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 07:02


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1048494782617505812/1049219087856844851/image.png?ex=65e571ec&is=65d2fcec&hm=ceede97794cd5d1d8135a67f01c80aef88e6b6ec09b2cae3eb77fc7cd8c3430c&)
pahahhahaa yeah
it eats the Start input using the fucking `rSbtn` method
when it opens a save select

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/05/2022 07:27

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ connor I bumped VERSION for‚Ä¶"): Still broke everything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 07:29

oh?
rip
not sure what I did wrong there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 07:31

....oh, hmm, are any of those `VERSION = 0`?
think I missed something in the math on that
you had an `==1` check before though, which I assume would have been `< 2` if 0 were possible....
oh, or wait, duh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/05/2022 07:34

Please try running locally first
Just pass in the correct build folder to the python script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 07:35

except I'm trying to do stuff right now with updating docs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/05/2022 07:35

Literally just run one test at least

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 07:35

far easier to let github do it for me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 07:37

and me running it only checks 64bit windows

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/05/2022 07:39

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "except I'm trying to do stuff‚Ä¶"): Then toss in a branch and wait if you're not sure?

There isn't a need to push to main _immediately_, without testing
Just a stickler here for clean main history,. especially when it comes to rebase situations
Er, bisect I mean

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 07:40

apologies

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/05/2022 07:40

all good I am super happy you worked it out!!
this seemed very annoying to debug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 07:41

aye
it was just that the previous fix only fixed the `= false` problem
not the equal but opposite `= true` problem
just had to fix the other part of it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 08:28

.... @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) not sure what's wrong with the replays
not enough energy to figure it out tonight

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/05/2022 08:36

I'm busy for a couple days, but we can't have James/whoever playing with partially extra borked input/recording so I reverted all of it. Can look myself by Wednesday.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 08:40

k

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/05/2022 09:23

Found some time before bed to fix. Should get verification all is good with input before merging, don't want to bifurcate the inpute handling/record stuff further. @ Deathrider @ DeletedUser in your own time, please try the nightly: https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-12-05
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/4ea469009a17f8ab154cf9c42b36302547a0a7a5

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2022 09:26

ah fuck I see what I missed now
I'm a dumbass

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2022 11:03

(for the record Nightmare, that should *hopefully* fix the automatic continue bug you ran into)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/06/2022 02:27

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Found some time before bed to‚Ä¶"): @<role: Tester> FYI, please verify that input is handled as expected (especially button presses)

=== @ NightmareJames 12/06/2022 02:58

Sorry if I've been out of it, I posted in General.  Not doing very well emotionally right now
Hopefully I can get to it after sleep, shower, and vacuuming
I am behind

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/06/2022 07:14

Previous test build broke new recordings, but fixed with new one I'm building now.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/06/2022 08:09

...ok had to fix it again lol this bug succcccccks

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/06/2022 08:32

https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-12-07

=== @ Deathrider 12/07/2022 14:11

I can test this today after work

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 01:44

with my current version of my quest with that build the map has the same issue

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 01:47

I am available tonight to assist with this if need be
I was going to start with rerecording a replay with debugging on

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 02:14

Uh, I wasn't seeing the issue ... I'll verify again later
Out to dinner now

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 02:15

I will be available for the next ~3hrs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 02:15

I only tried while recording. Does it happen only with no recording maybe??

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 02:15

I will try that

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 02:18

indeed turning recording off it works

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 02:18

Cool!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 03:03

It worked even without recording for me. I did test mode on M44 0x23

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 03:04

44 doesnt use the scripted map

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 03:04

Oh, I should mention: if the zplay file is version 7 or less _the bug will exist still_

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 03:04

map 32 utilizes it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 03:05

Hmm well I repro'd the bug there after I placed a dungeon map and used it, and then I fixed the bug
i'll try changing maps...
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Oh, I should mention: if the‚Ä¶"): so if you just continued an existing save/replay it would persist the bug

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 03:06

I have been creating a new one every time

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 03:07

Odd, still no issue for me here.
I'm going to post a new build which will at least hopefully fix the bitmap problem you saw
I'm placing a map item on the screen then test mode'ing it‚Äìthen space bar is able to open and close the map just fine
Is that right?
Without my changes, the map fails to close (for me).

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 03:10

I cannot seem to get past these bitmap issues now

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 03:14

when using a version of my qst saved in, played in the version you sent it works
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1048494782617505812/1050248878928187392/image.png?ex=65e930fd&is=65d6bbfd&hm=557e069db12d8be3afbd15094a10a597c4e1f9276c35afd94e53910b35a4a6e6&)
but if I try to rebuild the qst *in* the build withe the fix I get the bitmap errors

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 03:15

I had like a dozen commits not yet in my branch that were already in main. I merged them into my branch with the input bug fix and was able to record a new save file and play it back just fine. Hopefully you see the same, building it now.
( for later reference: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1050238902797090866 )
(https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1048488825866948658)

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 03:20

Yup, everything works fine, when the quest is saved in that previous version of ZQ and launched in your version of ZC
no issues

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 03:25

Oh, so the map button thing (even when not recording / and when recording) is all good?
That's what I'm seeing after more verification on my end

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 03:29

Yes, for some reason in the replay it seems the bug is still present but playing it manually it works

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1048494782617505812/1050252889966264380/Terror_of_Necromancy-Nov30.zplay?ex=65e934b9&is=65d6bfb9&hm=374fa1e4334cde7f9ee115d752736f4bfe500fce437837216836384bfc7b0902&

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 06:51

`ToNDemo3Nov30.qst` I don't have this file.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 07:11

I keep trying and trying to repro with recordings of `ToNDemo3Oct18.qst` and it always works for me.
Maybe something specific to your exact quest file.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2022 07:22

(replying to @ Deathrider ""): gotta provide your quest file, deathrider...

=== @ Deathrider 12/08/2022 14:44

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/08/2022 23:23

Reproduced and fixed, building new test build now.

cc @ DeletedUser

=== @ Deathrider 12/09/2022 01:24

so with the nightly posted with a quest built in that version you didnt have the map issue?

=== @ Deathrider 12/09/2022 01:28

I still had the issue with replays turned on and off through ZQ testing, and with testing in ZC

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2022 01:37

New build, fixed now I think.. https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-12-09

=== @ Deathrider 12/09/2022 01:47

Just tested it every way I could think and it works
from zq, from zc, with an without replays. no map issue

=== @ Deathrider 12/09/2022 01:49

I feel comfortable saying this bug report can be closed, at least from my perspective

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2022 02:08

thanks for testing!

=== @ Deathrider 12/09/2022 04:01

Thank you for the help!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/12/2022 05:48

Seems like I can merge this now. @ DeletedUser you didn't find any new issues w/ v8 replays right?

=== @ NightmareJames 12/12/2022 06:18

No new ones

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/13/2022 23:39

Feeling good about the fix here, one last confirmation in CI and then I'll merge for next nightly.
