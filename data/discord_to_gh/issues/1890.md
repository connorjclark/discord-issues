Since combos can spawn enemies, it would be a neat defence type if an enemy gets hit, it knocksback to lock into the combo grid, and becomes a combo (I would assume `transform into enemy` attrib would become the combo ID in the Enemy Editor)

theres an issue with this because most enemies don't have knockback, only walking, leever, flying, and maybe peahat/ghini

Either way, force snap into a walkable combo position
