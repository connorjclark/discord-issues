The attached screen is from End of Time DX, a 2.10 quest. At this point in the quest (which I cheated to in test mode to test it), you have the ladder and the flippers. In 2.10, walking left from the point Link is at now would activate the ladder, allowing you to cross the gap and hammer the peg to reach the block. In 2.50 and 2.55, you instead enter the water and swim, rending the room unsolveable.
