Just a reminder about this. Had to set this manually in the cfg the other day because ZC runs worse for me on Direct3D.

Does it crash when you resize w/ GL?

no issues on my end

Added this back to launcher, but let me know if you can resize/fullscreen/all that jazz just fine on windows w/ open gl

Doesn't seem to crash for me
Also I'll be damned, fullscreen actually works!
For the entire history of ZC before 2.55 it just crashed/broke for me. I've never been a fullscreen enjoyer
