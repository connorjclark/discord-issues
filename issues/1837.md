In 2.53 and older, Lock Blocks placed on layers one and two work just like they do on layer zero. In 2.55 this isn't activated by default, causing some difficulties when a quest uses this.

what 2.55 version did you test
I feel like I already fixed this?

Hang on
I think I downloaded it like a week or two ago

I believe that should be the fix

Okay, I just got a report on my quest from later that month about it and checked my version to confirm.
The version I had is older than that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2022 14:13

already fixed then

=== @ ywkls 09/04/2022 14:14

I'm guessing that whoever reported it to me just didn't have the latest version

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2022 14:14

aye, most likely
