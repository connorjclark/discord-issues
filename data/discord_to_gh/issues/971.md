So when I used 2.53, there would be this issue where the program would run at 30 FPS consistently, but when I would run a background process (A Discord VC, OBS, Steam, etc.) it would actually go _up_ to 60 for some reason. It's even worse here though, where the FPS is now locked at roughly 20 FPS when I'm not in other calls, but will not only move up to 45-50 FPS with a background process. While I have no clue what's causing the program to run better, it doesn't change that for some reason, there's a massive dip in FPS for 2.55 over 2.53.

are you using the built-in fps counter?

ye

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:09

does it flicker like the one in ZC does?
or is it a solid draw?

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:09

solid draw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:09

that being on may well be tanking your fps

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:09

wut
Any way to change that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:10

that's why the zc one flickers, to fix that problem
I'd recommend turning off the fps counter and seeing if it feels any better?

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:10

Nah, that's defo still 21 rn
yeesh

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:12

It's an issue I had for a while that I figured was just an issue with me using Windows 10 (I recall some dev discussion about it a long time ago), but since it's tanking even more it has me confused.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:12

does `frame_rest_suggest` do anything in zquest.cfg?
trying 0/1/2?

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:13

lemme check

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:15

nothin

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 09:21

oh yeah
i also noticed this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:23

and frankly, I'd expect 2.55 to be worse than 2.53, as more is going on

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:23

wait hold on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:23

once you're dipping below 60, it's not a stretch for it to dip further

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:23

something weird

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 09:24

it's been a thing for a *while*
tbh i didn't report it bcuz a couple years ago i had a crappy laptop where everything ran slow on it. guess i was still used to the slow framerate. lol

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:25

Weeeird, so I moved up in versions (since hehe hard to keep up), but uh

We're not at 21 anymore
so
intriguing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:25

????

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:25

it's still not _60_
but
weird

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:25

you updated 2.55 build?

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:25

I was like
a few days outdated

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:25

that should not have changed a damn thing

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:25

No clue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:26

nothing changed in at least a month should have much effect on fps

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:26

a few days meaning a couple weeks

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 09:26

mine always sits around 30fps

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:26

in this case
yeah idk what's happening

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:26

could be random video driver garbage

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:26

maybe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:26

which, would put it out of our possible control

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:27

also does the frameskip function work or what

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 09:27

a lil weird that zc player can run buttery smoof but zquest can't keep up the pace, lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:28

I mean
check the .exe sizes
ZQ is like twice as big an exe

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 09:28

true

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:28

fair

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 09:30

~~unfortunately it's now consistently around 51 instead of increasing when I have background processes but hey, 51 means I can _somewhat_ do my funky frame data stuff I wanna do in ZC better~~
I'll let ya know if more weirdness happens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 09:30

Apparently mine sits around 30

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 09:31

ayy
30 buddies

=== @ Haylee 08/31/2021 12:13

welp the FPS thing was a fluke
good to know
we're back to bad fps

=== @ 4matsy 09/01/2021 04:55

Ayy, more 30 buddies. :p
Yeah I'm still on alpha 92 since Mom and I's internet was out for a few weeks - let me go and download the latest nightly alpha and I'll see how that one compares. :o
