**Used version:** nightly-2023-07-30
(Might be an intended feature)

If you set a new combo pool, and some of the combos have a set colour set using "Use CSet" while the others don't:
For the combos that don't have "Use CSet" checked, the game will randomly switch between the current CSet when placing the tile and the CSet of the combo that has "Use CSet" checked.


See in the example:
If you fill an empty screen with "replace all" with that combo pool, few of the footprints in the snow will appear white (using the currently selected CSet 2 when using the *replace all* command), while some of the footprints will appear blue and use the CSet 4 that has been selected for the ice block combo instead.

The ice block combos will all appear with CSet 4, as is to be expected since the combo has "Use CSet" checked.
