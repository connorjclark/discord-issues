Quick access to the string editor can be handy when performing some story and script related stuff. When room data got merged into one menu the S hotkey was freed up again. Could the hotkey for opening the string table be shortened from Alt Q, S to just S? (This'd also ease up some muscle memory for me since I frequently used to use the A and S hotkeys to preview screen special items and the string table)

That did used to be the room string, huh?
I always hated that S wasn't string editor...

You should add "Scroll and select string in current screen" like "Scroll to combo"
