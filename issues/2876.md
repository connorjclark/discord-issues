@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) can you work on this please?
is this "new_menu.cpp"?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 07:07

so, what was the expected behavior here?
and yes, likely

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 07:07

you can use arrow keys to navigate the system menu
open an older build, it's instantly obvious
esp w/ ESC opening the File menu for you
then you can just use arrow keys to navigate

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 07:08

esc also only opens the file menu half the time
and the other half the time it closes it
which is fun
so, is it just the ability to left/right between submenus?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 07:09

no up and down work to
have you really never used it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 07:09

well up/down work on the new menus too

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 07:09

oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 07:10

so it's just the left/right that's missing?
and esc opening the game menu instead of closing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 07:10

I am able to expand one of the menus, have nothing be selected, and up/down do nothing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 07:10

which, given that it historically *randomly did both*, I can't see how either behavior there is more correct

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 07:10

If I hover over something then yes up down workjs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 07:11

ah, up/down isn't working with nothing selected
ahk

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 07:11

i think ESC always paused and opened the menu for me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 07:11

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "i think ESC always paused and…"): it definitely doesn't do that at all consistently for me on older builds
thus why I didn't replicate that behavior in the new menus; that wasn't the old behavior I got
and, exiting the menu on esc (instead of hard-requiring the user to click with the mouse to close the system menu) seems sensible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 08:38

this is being more trouble than I expected. Love when local editing allegro stuff seems to be the cleanest option.
(There's `readkey` to pop a key from the key buffer, but no `peek` equivalent...)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 08:55

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) so, I do highly prefer escape exiting the menu.... but, it makes total sense to allow *using the arrow keys* to focus the menu even when it wasn't focused, which gives you a keyboard way to access it still. Does that seem acceptable?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 08:56

This is how ESC works for me:

- playing game
- hit ESC
- paused, with first menu opened
- i hit esc again
- menu closes, still paused
- esc again
- game is unpaused

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 08:57

the behavior of that first ESC is all that interests me. I don't care for the second usage. The third usage of it unpausing is useful too, though.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 08:58

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "the behavior of that first ES…"): ah, k, you just want it to pop by default for esc... hmm

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 09:00

ESC UP ENTER
thats is burned into my memory for QUIT
I'm sure others use ESC too for quickly accessing those other options there

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 09:02

i guess alt+4 works just as well for me - but End Game is still useful to access w/ only keys

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 09:02

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "ESC UP ENTER"): ...good that you noted this, as I also appeared to miss vertical wrapping there
esc is popping the menu appropriately again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 09:07

...and vertical wrapping is restored.
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "i guess alt+4 works just as w…"): (for the record `F6` does this)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 09:26

Awesome
managed not only to get all of the stuff you asked for here working
but also fixed my pet peeve
holding escape down will ***NOT*** cause the menu, that escape just opened for you, to then close.
(It is storing the escape down state, and until escape is released, ignores any `KEY_ESC` signals from the `readkey()`)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 09:36

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) pushed, lmk if anything is still bothersome

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 09:38

Awesome, thanks!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2023 09:41

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "This is how ESC works for me:…"): but yeah this was not consistent before. Half the time it would open the first menu for like a frame and then instantly close it, and half the time it would *open the first menu* instead of closing, but half the time it would close properly.... it was janky as fuck
so, as long as I can get it working consistently and sanely, all is well

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 00:48

only issue

I found was on the Settings menu
Up doesnt loop to the bottom
also an idea: Space to toggle the true/false items w/o closing the menu
or have enter do that, I guess
maybe even click too

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 05:44

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) not sure if you saw this^

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2023 05:49

...I have 0 idea how that's even possible
to only be for that menu and not the others
because like.... they are literally running the exact same code....
OH WAIT

except there's hidden options at the bottom of the menu
and it's selecting those even though they aren't visible
bleh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2023 05:56

fixed
