A new version of the recolor tool, that better supports 8-bit (i.e. can recolor an entire palette worth at once, instead of only 16 colors at a time), and recolors the *entire tileset at once*, instead of just the selected region.

Mainly to be built around the premise of editing your palette for organization purposes, and being able to update every single tile so that they are all correct under the new palette.
