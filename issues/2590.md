This came up in z3 channel

Having Subscreen UI elements overlayed across the normal playing field area would be really good for some things. This could be accomplished by removing the current height limit for passive subscreens (and only let the background color cover the old height of the Subscreen). Elements will need a flag to optionally not move down when passive subscreen is swapped for active


Another approach is by a new Subscreen type "overlay".

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/18/2023 22:20

Might go with an overlay type that just covers the 256x168 screen area

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/18/2023 22:22

which then doesn't run with the active open

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/18/2023 22:25

Maybe, but consider this example: a key counter that is overlayed over the playing area. during active subscreen if you still want it there...shouldn't it be possible to keep it there?

you could just make the same sort of key counter in the active subscreen but now you see it disappear when you open the active subscreen, then it slides back in.
I think a flag for "show overlay on active" might work (or the inverse, whatever default makes sense)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/18/2023 22:25

mm... so full 256x224, stays but doesn't move

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/18/2023 22:25

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/18/2023 22:25

the existing flags for showing during scrolling can affect if it shows on active or not

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/18/2023 22:26

100% on using 224 for the height
lets overlay it on the screen, not the playing area

=== @ vlamart 08/19/2023 07:53

Would this also be useful for being able to choose whether the passive subscreen is on the top or bottom of the screen?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/19/2023 08:10

You could have an overlay subscreen and just use the bottom part of it I guess. But the top of the screen would still have space set aside for a passive subscreen. Unless we're talking about my not-released extended height mode, in which case that space is reclaimed for the normal play view, but that's only relevant in regions larger than a screen in height.

If you mean having the passive subscreen and all its behavior but just on the bottom, so that is moves along with the active subscreen which would then come in from the bottom instead of the top... I think that's not what we're working towards here.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/19/2023 08:12

> just use the bottom part of it I guess

This would be overlayed over the playing field too, so you'd want to be careful about how much stuff you put on it. Just putting a traditional passive subscreen down on the bottom would be awful.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/19/2023 08:15

I may have a nice way w/ z3 branch to control the positioning of the "playing field offset" (that's the top 56 pixels which the passive subscreen accounts for...), which is what really would be needed to have a passive subscreen on the bottom. Would only need to invert the position of the active subscreen. But again, I don't think this is what we're getting at here right now.

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) that was ASTOUNDINGLY easy?
(I still haven't done the GUI work for assigning which overlay subscreen to use, but, by creating ANY it automatically became the default for all dmaps because it's index 0 lol and there is no `(None)` option
(just waiting on Moosh's merge for the gui work)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2023 06:43

here it is staying over the active

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2023 06:44

And here, the top widget is, but the bottom one is NOT, because that's configurable per-widget (using the *already existing* settings, nothing new there, that already existed to allow hiding things from the passive on the active)

so, this looks to be... all done except for dmap editor.

Oooh idea; with script access, can the widgets be transparent too? So like one could script the counter becoming opaque when it increases, and become transparent after x num frames

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2023 15:35

There's no script access to widgets yet
Nor any plan for such
