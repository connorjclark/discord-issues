In recent builds, the active subscreen tracker map that shows rooms visited in dungeons seems to be reacting to DMap Offset and displaying wrong.

If the DMap Offset is flush against the left column of the map (dungeon 0, 0 is also map 0, 0), it displays correctly. In this screenshot, the DMap Offset is -1 (dungeon 0, 0 is map -1, 0)

uhhh
check compat rules for something mentioning `charting` or `charted`
and see how that affects it

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 18:39

I will, but also note this was a quest last updated in an older version, so by default it has this bugged behavior when played in recent builds.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 18:41

"Dungeon DMaps Use Classic Charting" is toggled on by default.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 18:42

...ok, that's the right setting, so there's a bug

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 18:42

Yeah, toggling it off and re-entering that dungeon did not change anything with the character map.
~~not my weirdest autocorrect~~
I noticed this too when James was playing through my 4th entry, and it had to have been saved in a recent version to have additions like the Whistle removing Jinxes.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/11/2021 15:40

Definitely noting this.  Kept quiet because didn't know what was causing it

=== @ NightmareJames 11/13/2021 19:41

We definitely need to get to the bottom of this.  Now that I actually got a half hour to concentrate, is this being caused by offsets on the slider in the dmap, or something else?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 22:32

it only breaks with negative offsets
which is probably why this wasn't caught sooner

fixed
weird fucking math shenanigans

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 22:59

basically, the problem is
when you have a negative offset
it has less than 8 screens per row to check
but the way the math was working
it always checked 8 screens
so it weirdly bled some screens from the next row into it
and offset fucking everything
making a giant fucking mess

=== @ NightmareJames 11/14/2021 23:00

I'll test it later tonight or tomorrow

So far so good, not seeing any broken tracker maps.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 00:55

good

=== @ NightmareJames 11/15/2021 15:31

This looks completely fixed
