If I copy a screen for its assorted attributes because I have Side Warp data on there, and I want to paste that data to quite a few screens to create a Dmap transition across an entire vertical strip of screens, the current paste data feature forces me to paste _all_ of the warps, not just the side warps.  So I'll have to overwrite any tile warp data that's there at the moment.  

Here's what it looks like now.   <screenshot>

Is there a way to separate them into Tile and Side warps rather than just "Warps?"

Specifically, it's not that I want all of those screens in this hypothetical vertical line of screens to lead to the same screen.

What I'm really looking for here is a way to avoid having to scroll through a list of Dmaps for every screen, and just go through each screen and ONLY set the numerical warp, because that "Paste -> Side Warp" suggestion would have already set the desired Dmap for each screen.  So it's a time-saver.

I'm actually a little bit surprised that no one had any opinions on this one at all.  O.o

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/11/2023 15:49

Still very surprised.  Is there just some area of the UI that lets the warps be split between tile and side when pasting and I'm missing it?

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Still very surprised.  Is the…"): don't think so
it's just, it's such a small thing
and the way the various paste options work, being in a menu like that, adding/changing stuff there is more than a tiny bit of work

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/11/2023 17:04

Ah, sorry to hear.  I appreciate the input though!
All good.
The closure is nice, to be honest.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2023 17:04

(If we entirely reworked it to work like combo advanced paste, where you check boxes for each thing, that would be a lot easier to add new stuff to)
(....but that requires ***entirely reworking screen pasting***)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/11/2023 17:05

That's definitely not reasonable.  I agree.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2023 17:05

I mean, it's reasonable
it's just, for the level of useful it is, and the amount of work it takes, doesn't really earn it a priority spot on the todo list

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/11/2023 17:05

Exactly.  Any reasonable person should happily agree with you there.  <:linkshrug:302956255960498176>   Again, I Appreciate the input. ^_^
