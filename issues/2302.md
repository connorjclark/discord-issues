(apparently the buttons in the Midi Specs need special characters)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/12/2023 18:49

Also on the subject of places special characters are needed...

(strangely the arrow icons are fine in the tile editor, so.... copy code from there I guess?)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 08/08/2023 15:32

These three graphical issues are still in 116.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/09/2023 00:12

Any chance you can provide reference screenshots of what they SHOULD look like? (To fix this properly, I'll need to recreate what it used to look like, from scratch, using drawing commands... so reference images for each wrong symbol would be useful)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 08/09/2023 03:27

How the midi info used to look (as shown above, all that info is mashed together right now)

Midi editor Icons

Arrows in combo editor, which should be the same as the tile editor ones?

All of these were from 107, as I forget when newer builds redid parts of the UI and broke those characters / icons.

so

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 08/12/2023 06:18

Combo Editor has arrows now, correct? Tile editor was actually fine.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 06:19

its identical

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1095136466662850572/1139805327685075026/image.png?ex=65ebff6e&is=65d98a6e&hm=278a8d591c5602a81a9b9c2143ea84e25c8001ab6510d1ad61eacfb1103ff776&)
maybe the `font` value was different, but I changed every instance of this
You know how connor mentioned it was using special character hardcodes, right?
`"\x88"` for up arrow
etc
...now it's NOT.
It's calling a function that doesn't take a string at all and instead takes a constant for which special symbol to draw using custom draws.
so, every spot that was using symbols like this is redone
oh, also

the arrows under here

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 08/12/2023 06:21

Until we both realize we forgot an obscure spot.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 06:21

I actually changed this spot
it used to be a single arrow for the spot you copied, and a single arrow for where your cursor is
I changed it to be a double arrow for where you copied, to differentiate
I used a regex to find in all files that I hope caught themk all

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 08/12/2023 06:22

What's funny is that this broken font thing wasn't the initial focus of the bug report. I screenshotted the broken tightly packed text of the main midi list and then the buttons with bad font in the midi editor.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 06:23

gotta fix the text still

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 08/12/2023 06:23

I then relized the other broken font places and grouped them here, since if you fixed the midi editor you'd have the fix for anywhere else.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 06:25

I'm reworking the subscreen editor for some stuff and wanted to fix this because I need to add more new buttons and new symbols lol
so figured better to get the good system in place for it

The leftmost of the longest line of text rests at that x position, everything spaces from there
```cpp
        int lh = text_height(font);
        char const* strs[] = {
            "Volume:",
            "Loop:",
            "Start:",
            "Loop Start:",
            "Loop End:"
        };
        int tw = 0;
        for(auto str : strs)
        {
            int w = text_length(font,str);
            if(w > tw)
                tw = w;
        }
        int tx = x+tw;```
yay manual calculation for old dialog stuff

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 08/12/2023 06:32

Manual text alignment. Totally haven't had to deal with that before.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 06:32

Also, do you want to know the size of the arrows and such relative to the buttons they are inside, for all the ones that are in buttons?
It takes the smaller of the button's width and height, square roots it, \*1.25s it, and rounds it, to get the arrow's main dimension (which is the smaller one)
took that fancy a math for it to look right using a consistent formula for the various size buttons

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2023 17:52

Is there more to do here or can we close?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2023 18:02

Ah, should be good after the subscreen branch merge
Knew I was missing a thread somewhere
