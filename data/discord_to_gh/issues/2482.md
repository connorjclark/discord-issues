I have no idea what could be causing this. See the included video. Note the shutter in the room with the eye switch and pitfall. Nothing with screenstate carryover has been set up between screens.

Also note that the eye switch is entirely reliant on flags while the torch puzzle utilizes the combo trigger system.

=== @ P-Tux7 06/29/2023 01:21

the combos do not touch any of the level or global states, right?

=== @ Phosphor 06/29/2023 01:24

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "the combos do not touch any o…"): All are set to the default value of 0
and none are checked with GlobalState ->

=== @ P-Tux7 06/29/2023 01:25

figured. just making sure
since some havoc might occur when copy-pasting combo properties

...I recall something like this being fixed a while ago
mayhaps something got accidentally unfixed? or?

=== @ Phosphor 06/29/2023 04:13

I'm guessing it has something to do with the game storing the fact that the torch room's puzzle has been completed upon re-entering, then the game references the previous room's stale secret state and assumes that the eye switch has been triggered too
Because it only happens after solving the torch puzzle, leaving the room, re-entering the torch room, then traveling north to the eye switch room

=== @ P-Tux7 06/29/2023 15:54

Huh... does either screen have Screen State Carryovers checked in the Screen Data?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/29/2023 16:05

that wouldn't make sense
it would be instant
you wouldn't need to go back and forth multiple times

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/29/2023 16:08

. . .
looks like we fixed this issue a while back for *secrets*
and then trigger groups got added new
and fucking
....didn't account for it there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/29/2023 16:16

should be fixed for EVERYTHING, I just applied the fix as a wrapper for the entire loading function
...hopefully that doesn't break anything else.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/03/2023 14:22

@ Phosphor confirm fix?

=== @ Phosphor 07/03/2023 14:35

Will test soon

=== @ Phosphor 07/05/2023 16:04

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Phosphor confirm…"): Confirmed
