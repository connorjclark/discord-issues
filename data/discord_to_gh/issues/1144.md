=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:45

Rebringing this up so we can put a bow on ZC 2.XX. I'll do some test quests tomorrow but I'm pretty sure the issue is that Lanmolas (and moldorms maybe?) count as dead even if you only kill one segment, even if the QR to fix it for Digdoggers is set. I think killing one segment also kills all the bosses in a room if you leave and come back, even if the QR for Must Defeat All Bosses is set. That is to say, similar to a Digdogger in Z1, kill 1 segment, die and come back or exit the room and come back, whole thing is dead. And I think whole room is cleared if it was a Dungeon Boss room

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:47

The obvious first thing to look at (and solution to copy) for clues on how to fix this would be the 3-Digdogger, which has had both issues successfully fixed and does NOT add one to the room's dead enemy count until all 3 kids are killed, and does NOT set the all enemies beaten in that room status or DMap boss room flag status until all 3 kids are killed. With those NESFix rule(s) on of course

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:53

Might also be worth looking into "Temp Set No Return", which is also a QR that messes with Lanmolas. Maybe setting that on or off fixes some of the glitchy behaviour by mistake, similar to how Enemies -> Secret had to be set on to have "Must Hit All Triggerable Combos" secrets in 2.50/3 that didn't activate if you triggered one, left the room, and came back?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:55

Just writing this down for myself tomorrow...

1. Lanmola alone, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments on (if that's a rule?
2. Lanmola alone, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments off
3. Lanmola as part of a boss room, Must Kill All Bosses on, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments on
4. Lanmola as part of a boss room, Must Kill All Bosses on, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments off
5. Lanmola as part of a boss room, Must Kill All Bosses off, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments on
6. Lanmola as part of a boss room, Must Kill All Bosses off, Must Kill All Digdogger Segments off
All of these will be tested by killing one segment, leaving and reentering the room and seeing what happened.
Oh and 7-12 for Tmp. No Return on. This is gonna suck

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 02:38

@ DeletedUser can you give any details that you remember, I recall you saying this during one of your James Quest streams

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 03:31

I'll work on this tomorrow.  I spent a lot of time on ZC tonight.  I need to do some other things

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 10:42

Time for a ton of test quests.........
I don't remember all of it, @ P-Tux7 , start creating the test cases and let's start testing them

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 19:42

Okay so lanmola just sets the "you killed the whole screen" flag when you kill it.
regardless of if there's more than 1 lanmola or etc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 19:47

@ P-Tux7 out of curiosity, is it specifically "you kill one segment, the whole thing counts as dead", or "you kill the lanmola, all enemies count as dead"?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 19:49

i think it's both, i'll have to check
btw what rule is it that determines whether a 3-digdogger counts as dead when you kill all 3 segments or only 1
or is that just lumped into "must kill all bosses"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 19:54

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "btw what rule is it that dete…"): It's "Temporary No Return Disabled"
And that rule *does* seem to affect lanmolas
Okay, Lanmolas don't actually obey "enemy never returns"

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 19:57

ok so i gotta test them as ringleaders
temporary no return disabled
must kill all bosses
and in boss rooms vs non-boss rooms
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "It's "Temporary No Return Dis…"): also is temp set no return a different rule or the same

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 19:58

Temp set no return?
where is this rule?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 19:58

oh it's in the 1.90 docs
must have been renamed then

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 20:00

phantom menace said it was related to "in nes zelda, lanmolas in level 9 don't respawn when you continue, but they do when you leave and re-enter. this rule makes them always return" (or was it "respawn like normal enemies"?)
so perhaps its that rule you said
sorry not at home

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 20:01

so, you know how enemies don't respawn until you go a certain distance away?
that's temp no return

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 20:02

yup
oh hmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 20:02

so, temp no return disabled.... disables that

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 20:03

i'll check where that rule was in the 1.90 rules menu - should be in the same order in the quest rules file, since those are sorted by chronological order

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 20:14

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so, temp no return disabled..…"): No, that's not it
temp no return disabled disables the lanmola and digdoggers counting the whole screen as dead if you kill a single enemy one of them onscreen

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 20:17

I have the source open, it's called in exactly two places, and both of them function as whether or not to check the mapflag "tempnoreturn" or to ignore it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 20:21

tempnoreturn is only set by:
rooms with line of sight traps in it (if a room has line of sight traps and you kill all enemies, the flag is set)
lanmolas whenever you kill one
Digdoggers check the flag, but for some reason they never actually set it
I'm curious if that's a bug that was introduced at some point

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 20:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so, you know how enemies don'…"): the rule that disables this behavior is "Enemies Always Return", and the internal variable for that is game->guys

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 20:26

oh
that's.... really poorly named

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 20:27

are you surprised?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 22:30

aren't ringleaders named superman in the code lmfao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2021 22:33

no
superman is the invincible variable
used for Link with cheats
and peahats while they are flying

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 22:34

...what
i'm surprised that hasn't blown something up yet
peahats are already awful when they WORK

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 22:57

kill_em_all is the ringleader kill command

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 06:26

@ P-Tux7 are you able to recreate this bug?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 06:53

whoops i'll check tomorrow
...hopefully
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Okay, Lanmolas don't actually…"): okay well this needs to be fixed too
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@ P-Tux7 out of…"): quoting so i'll remember it

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 02:49

downloading latest build...

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 02:55

sorry for the inconvenience but you'll need to use cheat 4 and go to level 1. the lanmolas are in the left room.

i needed something with a dungeon template
i checked the rule "must kill all bosses for "no return"" and killing one lanmola, leaving the room, and re-entering gives me the key

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 02:58

okay swapped 'em with aquamentuses and killing one, then leaving and re-entering leaves there one aquamentus
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903927601477849088/912900000571334707/1stClassic.qst?ex=65e7dbe0&is=65d566e0&hm=5b476fad55edace47a249dc70566f3f2cc24afc10146e7325eb1cbca2d797f02&
so apparently the issue is that killing one lanmola is just setting the screen as You Killed Everything for some reason
is it something to do with the flag that boss rooms use to know to clear the room of enemies?
does it have something to do with their broken "never returns after death" checkbox? that it's incorrectly telling zc to not return these enemies?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:02

okay so here's phantom menace's description of TempNoReturn
``` - TmpNoRet Disabled: This was my solution to a strange problem in the NES game. Lanmolas stay dead until you exit the dungeon. Also, if you beat everyone in a room that has traps, they stay dead until you exit. I called this "Temp No Return". So for true NES quests, this rule is left unchecked. If checked, lanmolas act as normal enemies, and enemies come back to rooms with traps just as if the traps weren't there. ```

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:04

oh ok mm
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903927601477849088/912901346817110096/1stClassic.qst?ex=65e7dd21&is=65d56821&hm=5658c70252c20a44dfc8aed0dea32a739ecc82efa54899cafb0575eb31d29aac&
turning that rule on makes it so that when you kill one lanmola and re-enter the room, there's still one lanmola left
that's a little weird but it seems to act as one would expect with tempnoreturn on - unsure if it's worth "fixing" to include lanmolas in the must kill all bosses chicanery if this rule is off. most people have both on, right?
now to test boss rooms

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2021 03:07

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "so apparently the issue is th…"): Could you check "disable temp no return"?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:07

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "turning that rule on makes it…"): ^ i did
that makes it act normal for non-boss rooms at least
now to test it with 2 lanmolas as the level 1 boss

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2021 03:08

Yeah, that's the point of that rule
it's a really shitty named rule

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:08

so the weirdness is that if you kill 1 aquamentus with Must Kill All Bosses on and TmpNoReturn off, it won't kill the other one when you return. but with lanmolas, it does.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:09

okay, seems to work, killing one lanmola and leaving the boss room leads there to be one lanmola remaining (i edited level 1 to have open doors to let you beeline straight to the aquamentus room)
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903927601477849088/912902824340385842/1stClassic.qst?ex=65e7de82&is=65d56982&hm=97a30cd81437f9bb82059a7e42ce50bcd1131834013d592ba6fb0b96f8653e5e&
ok things seem normal, but there's one last thing for me to test... i recall some rule that makes it where if you don't kill all the enemies in a Boss Room, you leave, and re-enter, they all respawn - even Z1 bosses (overriding the "Does Not Return After Death" enemy attribute)?
i'm not sure where that rule is but once i know i'll test that too

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:03

like i could have sworn there was this rule or something in some quests in pre-2.5 versions, which was preserved when you played said quests in 2.5, where if you had a room full of Manhandlas and killed one, then died, all 10 of them would be back the next go-round. what rule was that? i need to check how lanmolas interact with it

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:04

or am i going barmy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 04:31

Must kill all bosses to set No Return

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:32

different from must kill all bosses?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 04:37

what's the QR name for that
I've changed the QR name on my end cause it was confusing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:44

guessing the issue is that qr doesn't count lanmolas as bosses

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:44

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "what's the QR name for that"): "must kill all bosses"? near the top of enemy QRs
whats the name of the "...to set no return" rule
perhaps it should go right under must kill all bosses?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:45

6th enemy qr from the top?
if so then it's the same rule, just renamed

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:46

ok this is odd because i set "must kill all bosses", put two aquamenti in a boss room, killed one, left and returned, and only one remained
so what rule is it that spawns two if you leave and return

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 08:09

enemies always return screen flag + must kill all bosses
Bosses isn't dungeon boss
it's enemies marked with "doesn't return after death"

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 08:18

ah mm i'll try that then
maybe it's lanmolas fuck with the enemies always return flag, or it combined with that rule...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 08:18

it's very poorly named
Could you layman's terms what you've tried?
this thread makes my head spin a little

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 08:20

so each room has two lanmolas and i leave the room after killing one, and come back. this applies to all test cases
-no rules - 0 lanmolas when i return
-temp no return disabled - 1 lanmola
-temp no return disabled and must kill all bosses - 1 lanmola
-those two rules + boss room - 1 lanmola
now what's left for me to try is the screen flag, plus and minus the must kill all bosses screen rule

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 08:23

okay, so up to this point everything is working fine? (minus the temp no return rule being a stupid name and unclear)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 08:23

(by "disabled", i mean that's the rule name. the rule is checked.)
yup

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 08:23

okay, good
I sometimes find it hard to keep track of what's an issue and what's an observation

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 08:24

honestly might as well move it to NESFix or something? or name it "Fix NES Lanmola and Screen Flag Trap Interactions"
tooltip: "when this rule is off, killing one enemy in a room with lanmolas or the corner traps flag, leaving, and coming back (unless you leave the level and come back) will kill them all. recommended to turn on"
not sure about phrasing since they're "already dead" when you come back, you don't see them explode or anything
but it opens shutters, enables blocks, spawns item yadda yadda
also it might be BOTH of the nes trap screen flags idk

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 08:27

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "okay so here's phantom menace…"): ah seems its both zelda 1 trap screen flags yes (corners and center)
the rule and this help text was made before trap-spawning combo flags existed, and you could place traps as enemies. the screen data was the only way to spawn traps at all.
(sorry for all the edits to the rule name/tooltip)
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "now what's left for me to try…"): anyways replying for tomorrow

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 09:37

@ P-Tux7 Is this fixed, or was there anything I missed?
(meta) thread name was changed: 🔓Lanmola 1 Segment = Dead Fix

=== @ P-Tux7 02/08/2022 18:15

it appears that setting the modern rules fixes it
