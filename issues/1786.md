Hop into the Combo Alias editor.  Create a new Alias.  Click the "Org" button.  Keep "Copy" selected, and find an alias with layer 0 and layer 3 checked.

Copy that Alias to a new Alias slot.

Note how even though Layer 3 was active on the source Alias, the Destination Alias doesn't have layer 3 enabled __until__ you click the Properties button.
