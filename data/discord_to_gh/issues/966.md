@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Was testing out Tiny Quest:  Gold on stream in some spare time, and I upgraded Tiny Quest Gold from A 39 to A 85 to A 92, then ran it in the latest nightly.  What I ended up with is a crash in the Heart Container Room.  Video and quest file incoming when I package them

#961 feel like this is just the same issue

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?  You'd know better

But if this is the case, the original Tiny Quest probably has to be tested in 2.53 as well
