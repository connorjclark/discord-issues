=== @ jman2050 04/14/2022 23:47

Mainly a starting discussion on all the fundamental elements of a rewrite, including software libraries to use, structure and functionality of the program itself that differs from how ZC currently exists, discussion on what parts of the current codebase to integrate and what parts to reimplement.

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 01:49

this is gonna sound really silly, but what zelda will this be "based on"?
i know emily expressed a desire to not necessarily have to emulate everything from zelda 1 in the rewrite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 01:55

It will be based on ZC
Modernizing the concepts we already have, building the features people would most want (like Z3 scrolling, better layer options,etc)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 01:59

So, as for a framework
I have NO idea what libraries or such exist, so I definitely have no good input there
truecolor canvas with alpha transparency is a must, though
GUI colors should be from a GUI palette, which would be modifiable by loading a theme file or eventually using a theme editor
Saffith's dialog system is wonderful
except that it's wrapped on an allegro base
so, converting that to whatever new library would be a must
that gives us whatever we need for pop-up dialogs
We also want, for ZQ, a system where you can lock different panels to different places, customly
and resize the window by dragging the edges

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/964310876356243520/964345104447967262/unknown.png?ex=65ea71dd&is=65d7fcdd&hm=4b82fc72c14eef736a8b2c356d99e2a6710494f6f4b737d58455c132e867b564&)
Something like how this works
on the right, I have 3 separate panels added (simply adding more to the bottom allows stacking more vertically)
but, the top and bottom of those, actually have 2 panels there, which have tab selectors to swap between them
so, imagine here, having a combo panel as a "palette", a favorite combo panel, a 'quick commands'/favorite commands panel,
able to remove any of them completely, and re-add them from a menu option
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/964310876356243520/964345589993185340/unknown.png?ex=65ea7251&is=65d7fd51&hm=26c1cfb2e34050e3be8b0b904b6f9eb07403272625bbfabeec745c7fd564ca7e&)
Also, screens themselves
should get this down in this channel as well
no more "maps"
instead, you just add new screens with an add screen button
screens can be variable combo width/height/shape, with Z3 scrolling
Edge of screen by default does not go anywhere, as if on the edge of the map
but, you can add a sidewarp to each edge of the screen shape
of which you would use a scrolling warp to allow for normal scrolling
Then, if a side already has a warp
you can add a second warp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:09


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/964310876356243520/964346612187021322/unknown.png?ex=65ea7345&is=65d7fe45&hm=402dcddf9358de835343c4ee49eb2099e72d8e109125e294a00f4fab4132bee4&)
so, you could have no left warp
or one left warp
or, 2 left warps, split at any arbitrary y value
imagine, for instance, a room with a top left and bottom left door that lead to different neighboring rooms

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:10

gimp has dockable window code for reference and i think krita might too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:10

And, set a warp to 'cancel' to make that section of the side act as the 'edge of the map' again
Also, layers
Every screen starts with only layer 0
and then you can ADD layers from there with an 'add layer' button
give layer number a signed short range
because scripts might want layer space to play with
adding negative layers inherently would be allowed, no more treating positive layers as background nonsense
and, layers would NOT be separate screens
they would just be an extra set of placed combo/flag data stored per layer for that screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:15

Also, as for enemies, screw everything about Z1 bosses
make an 'enemy editor' that is capable of creating custom enemies with the behaviors of Z1 bosses, so that they don't need to be hardcoded jank shit anymore
a gohma side-to-side-while-facing-down walk style, with a 'weak point reveal' attribute that causes it to occasionally change state to open it's eye.... but then since it's customizable, people could use that to do any number of custom things
in fact, basically screw enemy types entirely
As for 'Guys', the entire Z1 room premise needs some work
Allow setting a custom combo for the room's 'guy'
and make room stuff in general less jank
Screen 80 is a nightmare
Since the idea of maps is going away, well
if layers are part of the screen
why not make the screen 80 cave part of the screen as well
and allow toggling to it via the warps menu
have a "cave template" screen somewhere that has the default setup for the screen 80 caves
but then, once you enter it for a screen, you can manually edit it without affecting others
set the room type/special item/etc in THAT menu
and, with that, there's no reason you couldn't have multiple 'screen 80' caves on one screen
as each would just be a separate instance of a 'cave screen' that is attached to the current screen
I am generally spitballing ideas at the wall here, but figure having more input is better than less
hope this is helpful @ jman2050

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:32

iirc solarus has its enemies draw from a library of core functions with individual code for enemies as well

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:34

so instead of batrobes being like hardcoded you could possibly have
-a flicker function
-a teleport in at random valid location not too close to link function
-a change animation function
-a spawn enemies function
-a teleport out function

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:38

and there's dozens of ways you could expand that
-a "harming this enemy's spawned enemies harms it" function
-a "kill all my spawned enemies once i die" function
-a "i cannot be harmed unless i have *n* children or less/more on screen" function a la Patra

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:43

like a 4-directional-movement, homing, jumping, segmented enemy only vulnerable on the front of its "head" while its eye is open, only shoots from the head while its eye is open, and which spawns a patra kid ring around itself which themselves would have configurable properties...
all those functions individually would be used to make gohmas, lanmolas, or patras, but they would no longer be locked to classes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:45

And for any of these things, we  could eventually have a "script slot" to allow completely customizing a given function

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:46

Though, any form of "new zscript" is a LONG ways away, I would want to get a base no-scripts high-functioning highly-customizable engine working first

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:48

forgive me but the idea was basically that the enemy editor generates script files (using a bunch of "includes") that can then be manually edited

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:48

Err?

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:48

so basically the best of zc's enemy editor and solarus' enemies' individual lua files/includes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:49

I don't know about that

=== @ jman2050 04/15/2022 02:49

obviously all of that can be debated
I'm sticking to the "remake ZC but better" design philosophy right at this moment, but I'm not gonna be worrying about those type of details until I can get a basic engine going

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:51

Mostly I want everything you ever would want in ZC now to be doable without a line of script

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:54

extreme psuedocode example

how a vire would be made by the user

internal functions/libraries:
-4-way movement
-jumping
-splitting

in the GUI, the user would select
Movement? Yes
Movement: 4-way
Movement Speed: A
Change Direction Random Rate: B
Jumps? Yes
Jump Height: C
Jump Random Rate: D
Splits? Yes
Splits Into What Enemy?: Red Keese
Splits Into How Many?: 2

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:55

The advantages of this are:

1. The "split" function is available for any enemy
2. If users desire the "split" function to have a new capability, the split library + GUI is updated in the next ZC version without touching any other library

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:55

I wouldn't know where to begin making engine enemy code directly editable, as that needs to compile down somehow then
Unless it worked like ZScript, in which case that would be very bad for FPS

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:56

i think solarus interprets it at runtime tbh? might be inefficient but convenient

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:56

That.... would be far WORSE for FPS
Hope you like slideshows
What language does Solarus run on?

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:57

C++ base with Lua interpreter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:58

The big problem here is that this whole idea feels very non-zc
Now, a more customizable enemy editor, would be wonderful

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 02:59

k just asked how the whole shebang worked over on solarus discord

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 02:59

And, allowing linking some form of zscript in with the behaviors, also sounds worthwhile
But only if you were to select a scripted behavior option to load a script for

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 03:01

i may not have said it very well but the idea is that like
modifying an engine hammer or patra with scripts SUCKS, right?
the idea is to have the engine hammer or patra or whatever be a script, which can then be forked or cloned for the individual quest's needs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 03:02

Making every engine behavior a script sounds painfully awful
And certainly not something I would want to try to set up and maintain with as few devs as we have

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/15/2022 03:06

Also you notably used 2 great examples of hardcoded BS
Which, is something we would want to do away with

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 03:41

ok got confirmation
solarus' lua is turned into bytecode

=== @ cbailey78 04/15/2022 03:42

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "extreme psuedocode example

h‚Ä¶"): I agree!  Not everyone can write code like me. I can never grasp the basic concepts of scripting.  Everytime I see a new script upload on PureZC, I can't help but get a sense of envy to those script savvies.

=== @ jman2050 04/15/2022 05:58

Right now the simplest way to start seems to be using a combination of SDL and OpenGL as the main backend
since OpenGL is on everything and it's better to make use of GPU acceleration even for 2D games
obviously we'd either need to write our own gui system or make use of something else

=== @ P-Tux7 04/15/2022 06:30

||Allegro||

=== @ jman2050 04/17/2022 10:58

Small update: Experimenting with SDL+OpenGL is seeing success, if things are designed carefully the general rendering pipeline won't be TOO dissimilar from ZC, just with far less Allegro involved üòõ

=== @ jman2050 04/17/2022 11:00

Resizeable windows will be a trivial task too, but nonetheless we should probably have discussions on resolution limitations we may want to impose internally

=== @ P-Tux7 04/18/2022 03:17

so i presume nothing from existing quests will import into the rewrite?

=== @ jman2050 04/18/2022 04:23

It‚Äôll probably be simple enough to write a converter or something when the time comes, but there would be no pretense for behavioral compatibility

=== @ jman2050 04/18/2022 04:25

the ideal is for the rewrite, as I understand it anyway, would be to hew as close to any original functionality we inherit from ZC as is reasonable.
But not strictly so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/18/2022 17:58

Mostly, graphics can all be imported
because... they should all be recreatable with whatever new graphics system exists
Screens, would be a bit harder, as it would need to generate new sidewarps for every single screen
combos, would need to do a LOT of conversion, as many old combo types/flags likely will no longer exist directly
for instance, a `Block Arrows` combo, would just be a `Block Weapons` combo set to trigger from arrows
so, that would need to run that conversion

=== @ jman2050 04/18/2022 18:00

Worth noting that ZC already does these type of conversions to an extent even now
When loading very old quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/18/2022 18:00

Aye
Frankly though, I'd like to have such a conversion be like a separate .exe, as a 'quest converter'; that way all the various versioning info for pre-rewrite quests wouldn't need to be stored in the main new exes

=== @ jman2050 04/18/2022 18:01

Not that the new program would need to load old ZC quests natively, that‚Äôs probably unnecessary
Yeah exactly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/18/2022 18:02

aye, perfect, on the same page
glad to have you here to help get this started

=== @ jman2050 04/18/2022 18:05

We‚Äôll see how far I go
I hope I get enough of a core done that other people can easily start extending its functionality

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/18/2022 18:10

Getting anything done before we would have is immediately a great help, regardless ‚ù§Ô∏è <a:hugheart:876927396215930930>

=== @ cbailey78 04/18/2022 22:28

I remember way back when there was a quest conversion called "Upgrade" that upgrades quests made in 1.84 to 1.90.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/29/2022 18:48

FYI.. I've been re-making the .qst file format here: https://github.com/connorjclark/zquest-data/tree/master/src/zquest/sections

If you want to go one further than "separate exe" and go "100% not even part of the new program or codebase", a python conversion tool could be nice.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/29/2022 18:50

+1 00 to using SDL

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/29/2022 18:52

any thoughts on ditching bison for a more traditional game dev scripting language like Lua (examples: https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/11/what-scripting-language-should-i-choose-for-my-game )

or is it important to keep zscript the same?

=== @ P-Tux7 05/29/2022 19:16

...bison?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/29/2022 19:25

That's what defines the grammar for Zscript and generates the code to parse and execute it
see the .y file in source repo

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/29/2022 19:27

Anyway, there are much better alternatives and tooling out there for game engine scripting. Could even hook up Python or V8. The idea is to use an established scripting language people are more likely to already know, or be able to leverage existing tutorials for them

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 18:26

That‚Äôs certainly a possibility
In a way implementing ZASM first was forward thinking, because that means the core logic processing is fundamentally decoupled from any specific scripting language
So reimplementing it as something like Lua is definitely doable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 18:28

You'd need some way to recognize everything from GlobalSymbols.cpp
To have access to all the internal functions/types
Seems like way too much to be worth it

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 18:29

Well it‚Äôs an option

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 18:29

And a lot of people know ZScript as-is, and are NOT traditional programmers
The idea of swapping to a "real" language might scare some people off

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 18:30

That‚Äôs also a good point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 18:30

As an *alternate option*, I don't see why that would be an issue
But to not have standard ZScript would hurt the program, I think

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 18:30

Actually yeah, there‚Äôs no reason per se why we couldn‚Äôt do both, or more

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 18:31

Having *more options* is generally good
Gives the user the choice
... Also means more code to maintain
So, it's a balance

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 18:32

Heck you could even fork a gcc variant to allow C code to compile to ZASM
Now THAT would be a fun exercise

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 18:33

Frankly, ZScript is similar enough to C
Especially now with enums, namespaces, etc
Still no classes, or floating point... But how would those work converted to ZASM anyway?
So, don't really see the reason to bother with C
That's the other thing to keep in mind is, it all has to become ZASM in the end anyway
So any features not supported in ZASM would simply be unusable
What you'd REALLY do here, frankly, is just create a new version of zscript, with different syntax
We have allowed a lot of things from other languages, though; there are plenty of alternate tokens now
`unless(a and b)` is valid
I've had ideas for class/object in ZScript, too, which I think would work
They are just FAR too complex to implement to be worth doing in 2.55
Better saved for rewrite

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 18:42

I think ZASM is technically Turing-complete so you COULD implement any algorithm you like
Not that you‚Äôd want to lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 18:49

Easier to add new opcodes
`PRINTF` is now one opcode, instead of a whole zscript function
also I made a single opcode for casting a value to bool
which replaces a 3-opcode set in several boolean operations, like `&&`/`||`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 18:54

How much of the new stuff that's been added have you looked at, @ jman2050 ? (just curious)

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 18:56

Not as much as I‚Äôd like
Been busy lately as my post in #deleted-channel can attest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 18:58

A bunch of std functions are now internal
all forms of string functions, printf, sprintf, distance,
min, max,
bunch of stuff
all much faster
One minute and I'll find the actual figure on how good internalizing printf was, I have it saved somewhere....

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:00

Yeah internalizing a lot of commonly-used functionality was a goal I had for ZASM
While also making it robust enough to allow for different implementations if the user wished

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:01

it was april 2020....
(yes I'm just digging through discord messages)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:02

bah, can't find the exact number anywhere, but I found an estimate
in a test script it saved something like 60k opcodes
just having printf internalized

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:03

lol nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:03

which was out of like 120k opcodes for the total script
sooo
yeah
std_zh printf was BAAAAAD

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:03

That‚Äôs definitely the kind of optimizations I like to see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:04

I also optimized function calls in general
There was something REALLY stupid that was left in, clearly from early dev
Every function call has to store a pointer to the stack before you goto
How did it do this?
SETV reg,pointer_value
PUSHR reg
Because `Bytecode.cpp` was missing the zscript-side for the `PUSHV` opcode
so nothing used `PUSHV`
now it just does `PUSHV pointer_value`
so, that's an opcode saved with every single function call

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:06

Ahhh okay that makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:06

There were a couple similarly simple optimizations with boolean operators
Also, short circuit is now a thing

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:06

Yeah I modeled the initial ZASM implementation off of Motorola 68k asm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:06

which means that `if(true || x > 5)` will compile the same as `if(true)`

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:06

That language only lets you push/pop registers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:07

because it always executes
and that is known at compile time
which, in fact

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:07

I guess when more expansive stack opcodes were added stuff like function calls weren‚Äôt changed to compensate

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:07

```cpp
if(true)
{
    Trace(x);
}```compiles identically to```cpp
{
    Trace(x);
}```
and ```cpp
if(false)
{
    Trace(x);
}``` compiles the same as ```

```

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:08

Nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:08

can't do an empty code block apparently
lol

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:08

Compile-time optimizations can be challenging

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:08

also, any `const int` or `const bool` works the same as the literals
so for instance, you can have `const bool DEBUG`
to toggle entire sections of debug traces
from even compiling

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:09

Though evaluating boolean operators at compile-time is one of the more trivial cases

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:09

Everything that is "optimized-out" is still checked for semantics, so still throws errors
but generates absolutely no zasm
so it ends up giving some really nice optimization, because it adds up

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:10

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:10

especially in a case where it's a database script and some conditions are user-changable
Also, I optimized arithmetic where possible

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:10

Reminds me how even C has trouble with stuff like that
Thus the need for a preprocessor pass

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:10

`+ 0` and `- 0` and `* 1` and `/ 1` are all ignored
`* 0` acts as a constant 0
so `x * 0` acts the same as `0`, thus not generating the zasm required to read from x
Oh, and there is `unless` and `until` as inverses of `if` and `while`

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:12

Oh man now I‚Äôm wondering if I bothered adding divide-by-zero protection

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:12

`unless(x)` is one opcode less than `if(!x)`
similar for while/until

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:12

I can‚Äôt imagine I missed something that fundamental
But I also know me so I can‚Äôt be sure lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:13

Well
there's no compile-time optimization associated with `/ 0`
thus no warning
...it just would print a zscript error, though

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:13

Okay that sounds fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:13

which now, with the runtime console, is very fine
very easy to notice
Probably COULD make it throw a warning

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:15

as long as it doesn‚Äôt straight up crash it‚Äôs fine lol
I mean you can‚Äôt really do the warning

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:15

No crashes left in 2.50.2 zscript that I'm aware of
You can warn if the 0 is constant at compile-time

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:15

It‚Äôs not like people put x / 0 in their code

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:15

well yeah
not likely
but you might divide by a constant
and that constant could be set by a formula of several other constants
so like
might not be so obvious

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:16

Yeah if that could be discerned at compile time a warning would be beneficial

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:16

`const` values are very optimized
literally at every point of the recursive ZASM creation, it can call `expr.getCompileTimeValue()`
which returns an `optional<long>`
if the long is returned, it can do compile-time optimizations with the returned value
if not, then it's a var

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:17

neat

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:18

Other new things!
`^^` (boolean XOR)
`~=` (bitnot equals, a shortcut for `&= ~`)
ah, and then the FUN one
`~~`, "Approximately Equal"
basically `==`, but the numbers need to only be close
How close is configurable with a compiler option

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:20

Hmm interesting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:20

```cpp
#option APPROX_EQUAL_MARGIN <float>
    Sets the margin of error for the ~~ (approximately equal) operator.
    The defailt margin of error is 0.0100, so (1.090 ~~ 1.080) == true.
    Set to a floating point value to use a new error margin for ~~.```
This had some specific use cases that were nice
mainly, sprite positions suffered from floating-point rounding error
That has been fixed since, thankfully
which only required writing an entire custom fixed-point type to replace allegro's `fix`/`fixed`

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:22

Yeah floating-point rounding was the bane of my existence at the time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:22

The thing I hate is
Fixed point
the whole point is that it isn't floating
What does allegro do?
Well, to do anything with the decimal section
It *converts to a float then back to a fix*
which like
***what the fuck***

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:23

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:23

https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/blob/2.55-master/src/zfix.h
took quite a while to get it working right
Anyway, other things
switch/case
but FANCY
```cpp
switch(x)
{
    case 1: case 2: //x == 1 or x == 2
        break;
    case 3...10: // x >= 3 && x <= 10
        break;
    default:
}```

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:25

I think the use case where rounding errors became untenable was spinning ffcs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:25

and
```cpp
switch(str)
{
    case "foo":
    case "bar":
        break;
}```
string-comparing switch
There's a compiler option which allows you to set it to be case-insensitive

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:26

An ffc rotating around an axis would eventually shift its axis or its orbital shape because of accumulated rounding errors in the x/y position

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:26

yeah
float sucks
so bad

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:26

So yeah this was a problem even before ZASM was a thing, now that I recall

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:26

What also sucks, unfortunately
is only having 18 binary bits in each number
because that's how fucking zscript ints work

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:27

Yeah that was my bad

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:27

It makes sense, because of how ints work

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:27

Actually I don‚Äôt think 64-bit values were a thing at the time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:27

I first solved it with compiler options

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:27

So it‚Äôs not ENTIRELY my fault

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:27

but compiler options for that suck
because you really don't want to toggle it GLOBALLY
so you would need to set the options in single functions
or namespaces

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:28

And I was really worried about memory usage at the time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:28

and make functions to do the binary operation
and then call those functions

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:28

So I didn‚Äôt want to use a double-int implementation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:28

yeah
makes sense
we don't have 64bit in use now either
that'll be something for rewrite
But anyway, now the binary problem is much more solved
because I added a new datatype
`long`
`1L` == `0.0001`
it uses the full 32-bit space

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:29

Ah yeah you mentioned that at some point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:29

`Game->Time` in 2.50.2 actually already was giving it's value in this form
because it needed the space
now I've made it actually return a long type
`00000000111111110000000011111111Lb` is a valid long binary literal
and yes, the far left bit correctly acts as the sign bit
that needed special cases
In any bitwise operation where at least one of the operands is of type `long`, it uses a different (new) opcode to do a 32-bit version of the bitwise operator

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:31

hopefully for the rewrite we can more properly implemented double-ints for large fixed-point values
Since I can‚Äôt imagine we‚Äôd need to target 32-bit hardware at all anymore

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:32

Also, `long` and `int` inherently cast to each other, no manual cast needed
though they are one step away for function-matching
so ```cpp
void foo(long x);
void foo(int x);```
that works as an overload

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:32

I would hope so, all you need to do is multiply/divide by 1000 üòõ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:32

nope, not how it works
it is defined to work as `1L == 0.0001`
so it literally just reads the same register value
ZASM has no idea long exists

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:33

Ah gotcha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:33

and does nothing new
because that would have been extra work

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:33

So to ZASM it just looks like you‚Äôre counting up by 0.001 for some strange reason üòõ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:34

Also, since I just used it in the codeblock above, forward-declarations are a thing. Except, they aren't really needed in ZScript the way they are in C, so you might wonder what the point is?
well
```cpp
int foo();```
if you have that
and you never implement the function
you can still call it
and it will return `0`
```cpp
int foo() default 5;```
That would return 5 if never implemented
(re-using the `default` keyword, so no new word needed to be reserved!)
This is useful in some cases
For instance, the main one which I had it in mind for
I have an FFC shop script on the database
which has the ability to interact with Moosh's empty bottles script
but, that's optional
In 2.50.2, I had to have the user comment one line and uncomment another based on if you were or weren't using that
because I had to call a function that was part of Moosh's script, that might not be included

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:36

Ah so it‚Äôs basically the default constructor of a base class
So to speak

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:36

Kind of
`bool CanFillBottle() : default false;`
that's what I'm using in the ffc shop script
The function in moosh's script checks if you have an empty bottle available

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:37

that‚Äôs nice, it‚Äôs kind of pseudo-inheritance without needing OOP

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:37

Without this
the 2.53 version of the script has
```cpp
//bool hasEmptyBottle = CanFillBottle(); //Use this version if Moosh's EmptyBottles script is being used
bool hasEmptyBottle = false; //Use this version if Moosh's EmptyBottles script is NOT being used```
soooo yeah
also, similarly
I've added a couple nice file management things
`IS_INCLUDED("filename")` is an expression that evaluates to a boolean at compile-time

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 19:39

is it correct to say that zscript doesn't share much syntax with other languages and is of debatable use if one wishes to have an actual indie game development career?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:39

`#includeif(bool, "filename")` is likewise available to include a file dependant on a compile-time boolean
2.55 has a lot more syntax shared with other languages

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:39

I mean it‚Äôs based on C but it‚Äôs not really a general-use language, no
You can definitely apply coding practices from ZScript to other languages though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:40

The premise of `script` is not very shared
and `class`/`object` is missing
but a lot of the other syntax is shared

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:41

well OOP is a whole other can of worms

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:41

`namespace`, `enum`, `typedef` are all available

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:41

I very intentionally tried to avoid OOP stuff in ZASM

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:41

Order of operations is fun
I think it's pretty solidly handled
but, the safest practice is to use parens everywhere XD

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:42

I think order of operations is copied straight from C?

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 19:42

i think he meant object oriented programming?

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:42

Not sure how DarkDragon did it come to think of it
Yeah OOP is what he said, in case there was confusion

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:43

or yeah
bleh
reading
oh, forgot about this one
```cpp
if(npc n = GetClosestNPC(32))
{
    DoSomething(n->X, n->Y);
}
else
{
    DoSomethingElse(); //no enemies in range
}
```
casting too
```cpp
///////////////////
// Explicit Cast //
///////////////////

You may now explicitly cast a value, using a type in angle braces.

    ffc f = Screen->LoadFFC(15);
    int x = <int>f;

    f = <ffc>2;```
Uses `<>` instead of `()` because of stupid bison errors that I couldn't figure out
ternary exists too
octal literals
array literals, char literals, string literals

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:46

I think <> are more commonly accepted for casting nowadays anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:46

It's the C-style cast, though, so comparing it to what it's based on it doesn't match

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:46

True

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:47

also, there is the `untyped` type
which casts to any type implicitly
and vice-versa
std_constants has `const untyped NULL = 0;`

=== @ jman2050 05/31/2022 19:47

Better than void

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:48

aye

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 19:49

New global (and Hero) script slots
`onContinue` was renamed to `onSaveLoad`, because, it was named terribly
`onLaunch` runs under both the conditions of `Init` and `onSaveLoad`, so, every time you launch the quest regardless of if it's first or not. It can also run for multiple frames, delaying the opening wipe until it quits, perfect for title screens.
`onContGame` runs on `F6->Continue` specifically
`onF6Menu`, if assigned, runs INSTEAD of engine F6 behavior
`onSave` runs every time the save file is saved by any means
(good for if your script needs to 'save' things to external files)
Hero `Init` runs whenever the hero object is initialized internally
`Active` same as global active
`onDeath` runs for multiple frames, either before or after the engine death animation depending on a QR. If it exits without calling `Game->Continue()` or a similar call, it will continue to the normal game-over screen, though it can act as a custom game-over screen.
`onWin` is similar in premise but runs when you touch a zelda flag before the engine credits
`dmapdata scripts` are similar to FFC in that you just have 512 numbered slots to assign, BUT like itemdata scripts have action/pickup, they have multiple possible 'slots' on each dmap

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/964310876356243520/981284498719273031/unknown.png?ex=65e77867&is=65d50367&hm=72bd177a26645fee78adc14f9ae5f18993e17f8a2989eb9b6428b86a6bc6e6d6&)
`Active` runs constantly while on the dmap
`Subscreen` tab has 2 which share their InitD: `ActiveSubscreen`, which runs when you press start instead of the engine subscreen, similar to `onF6Menu` above
`PassiveSubscreen` runs constantly on the dmap.
QRs allow you to set the passive subscreen and/or dmap active scripts to continue running during the ActiveSubscreen script
and the `Map` script runs once again similarly, but instead of the engine map
While any of these "multi-frame" script slots are running, nothing else in the ENTIRE ENGINE is running, which grants you a SIZABLE fps boost
and allows you to do much more complex things without tanking the fps noticably, including say, tons of draws
And the newest type

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/964310876356243520/981285309763436584/unknown.png?ex=65e77929&is=65d50429&hm=a654758b16ef1d36241552b8d0f2f9b1b1789305cb0406d7d33d41fbe1491cf2&)
Generic scripts
These slots never run in-engine, and nothing you set in ZQuest will change that
BUT
ZScript can tell them to run
They can either run "passively", meaning they act similarly to a global active script - though instead of having `Waitdraw()` to allow them to wait until a specific time later in the frame, they have `WaitTo()` which, using constants, allows you to wait until >30 different specific timings throughout each frame
or they can run "Frozen", in which case they act like the `onF6Menu`/`ActiveSubscreen`/etc in that they freeze the entire engine until they exit
that's the main interesting thing for script slots, aside from more objects just having associated slots
I added Annotations (ripped format from Java)
```cpp
/////////////////////////////
//       Annotations       //
/////////////////////////////

Annotations allow for metadata to be set in specific circumstances.

An annotation is specified as follows:
    @Key("Value")
Annotations can be listed together to use multiple on the same target, as follows:
    @Key("Value"), @Key2("Value2")```
...there's only one annotation usable at the moment.
```cpp
@Author("EmilyV")
ffc script foo {void run(){}}```
the first 8 `void run` parameters (type and name), script type, script name, and author annotation all are stored in "ZASM MetaData"

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/964310876356243520/981286515575488552/unknown.png?ex=65e77a48&is=65d50548&hm=2be47150ced2bf47c4ee4bd9301f6b9ed77aa02718179589218c74e74adc4dac&)
this is viewable in the slot assign dialog
that's the global init's data of a blank quest

Saving this as a nice summary of "what's new"

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 20:06

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "These slots never run in-engi‚Ä¶"): So does this require people to get a little familiar with editing and merging scripts?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 20:12

.... Not particularly, unless you launch them from global active
In which case it's the same as any other merging

=== @ P-Tux7 05/31/2022 20:16

How would you launch a generic script without manually putting the launch command in another script, is what I mean

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/31/2022 20:27

You don't
....but if it's launched from like, a specific ffc script, that doesn't require the user to merge ANYTHING
