if you spam the item button that has the arrow, the counter used goes down even when the arrow is on "cooldown"

....is that an engine arrow?
Because, that does not happen when I test it

=== @ Attempt 07/06/2022 16:18

=== @ Attempt 07/06/2022 16:20

it *might* be a bug for the x64 release

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 16:24

=== @ Attempt 07/06/2022 16:27

=== @ Attempt 07/06/2022 16:29
