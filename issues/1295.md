When you dont find the flute and you enter the boss battle in level 5 it locks the door behind you and you can only suicide. I dont think it was like that in the original game. (1st Remake)

it was
pretty sure there's multiple spots in z1 you can softlock yourself

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîíBoss Level 5 door locks you in

custom quest - does not apply to NES consistency

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 20:59

I just checked it
It does not lock you in
in the original game
bug found in darkflamewolf's remake

=== @ tim 12/21/2021 21:01

yeah we're not making changes on that - it's a custom quest and thats at the developers discretion
let me see if its in the actual 1st.qst

=== @ Kampy 12/21/2021 21:02

In the NES game it is not. I checked it.

=== @ tim 12/21/2021 21:04

level 5 is a key door
in the packaged 1st.qst this is not a shutter

=== @ tim 12/21/2021 21:06

since this is a custom quest, we aren't at liberty to change this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 21:09

@ DeletedUser report it to the questmaker
that isn't our quest, we aren't the right people to report it to

```It alters many things in the original quest, yet retains all of its secrets and dungeon layouts.```
