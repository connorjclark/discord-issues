The enemy behavior is fine, it just shows (NONE) in the enemies list

What type is it?

=== @ Deathrider 07/07/2023 21:24

Walking enemy

=== @ Deathrider 07/07/2023 21:25

currently updating my zq version, will update if I still have the issue
still see it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2023 21:28

weird
no idea and no time to look for a while
(vacation for a week starting tomorrow)

=== @ Deathrider 07/07/2023 21:30

it isnt a hude deal, just that I am not always sure where they are in the list, been trying to keep them near the top so I know

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 07:21

If you open the qst file in a fresh installation of ZC, do you still see this?
I didn't see the bug w/ the most recent qst you just gave me...

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 15:02

You mean in a fresh install of zq?

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 16:05

I opened my quest in that new build you made last night

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 18:04

I just wanted to validate you weren't copying over other things and carrying over incompatibile module files or fonts or something

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 21:20

gotcha, whenever a new build is out or anything before launching the game I always make sure to recompile and save

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 00:06

this enemy is id #4

and this lister says "any enemies below id 20, I will show as None"
Are the first 20 somehow reserved?
@ Moosh / @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)
If I just remove this conditional it works, but i'm curious the reasoning behind it

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2023 00:08

Oh! Those are "guys"
Used for NES quests with screen 80, where they appear in caves

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 00:08

So reserved, kinda?

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2023 00:08

They shouldn't appear in the enemy list at all

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 00:08

Got it.

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2023 00:09

Yeah if you mess with those who knows what they'd screw up
I think Zoria exposed them for some reason or another but it caused a lot of confusion
And I thought they got re-hidden

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 00:09

Let's make this label say `<whatever it was> (Guy!)` ?
Should we remove from the selection of enemies here too?

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2023 00:09

I think so? There should be no reason you'd place a guy on the screen manually

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2023 00:11

Could explain some of Deathrider's other problems if he's been overwriting his guys with custom enemies. Hope that doesn't cause any permanent issues

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 00:11

ehhhh allocating strings here is hard so I'll just change None to `(Guy - Do not use)`

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2023 00:11

I think if you're not using guys in your quest, modifying them with non guy data shouldn't cause problems, but there's a lot of silly hardcodes

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2023 00:13

feel a little silly. I should've been able to immediately diagnose Deathrider's issue just by looking at the enemy ID, but didn't even cross my mind that that was a possibility

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 00:20

100% the  first twenty should all be unselectable for enemies?
the lister code here was ignoring some of them already....

```
if ( i >= 11 && i <= 19 ) continue; //ignore segment components
```

in `build_bie_list`
(w/e "segment components" means...)

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2023 00:22

```//Guy IDs. Use with CreateNPC().
DEFINE NPC_ABEI              = 1;
DEFINE NPC_AMA               = 2;
DEFINE NPC_MERCHANT          = 3;
DEFINE NPC_MOBLIN            = 4;
DEFINE NPC_FIRE              = 5;
DEFINE NPC_FAIRY             = 6;
DEFINE NPC_GORIYA            = 7;
DEFINE NPC_ZELDA             = 8;
DEFINE NPC_ABEI2             = 9;```
Seems like just the first 9
I dunno what segment components are. First guess would be moldorms, but those can have variable length and don't have near that many segments

=== @ Moosh 07/10/2023 00:23

huh, there's no const for NPC_EMPTY
that's what 10 is

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 00:23

So these must be reserved, I guess.
Ok, disallowing first twenty seems good.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 00:35

Fixed this
