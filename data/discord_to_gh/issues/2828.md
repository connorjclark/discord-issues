Right now there isn't a way to remove a subscreenwidget via ZScript

subscreenwidget->VisibleFlags[]
Set all flags to flags to false to hide widget from subscreen.

Thanks that could work temporarily
My issue would be that there would be many unused subscreenwidgets there just using up memory for no reason

Unless you add/remove subscreen widgets en masse memory should not be issue on modern machines.
