Warp menu example quest attached. The warp to the mountain works, switching to string 2, and then executing a warp SCC. The warp to the lake... does not. It should switch to string 3, but switches to some unknown blank string value? Something is fucky here...

Bah, it only parses one character after the menu and then fucks up horribly, because I need to add a conditional to a spot.
easy fix
also a couple graphical issues in ZQ to check out, which I'll lump into this

now it actually does a `>` for `\129` (menu choice) control codes, a `[]` for `\28` (draw tile) control codes, and `(Name)` for `\22` (insert player's name) control codes in this preview
and it should properly account for all other control codes being invisible
which it was not before
