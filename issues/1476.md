I understand these aren't a big deal, but I might as well write it up.

Attributes:
-Enemy: What enemy ID to spawn
-Spawn Type (dropdown): Flicker, Puff, or Instant
-Enemy Max (If x enemies exist, do not spawn an NPC)

Flags:
-Use New Behaviour (a la the merging of the four Conveyor Belt types)
-Touched -> Next Combo (AKA BS Graves, but as a combodata flag). Goes to Next Combo even if touched when the combo cannot produce enemies as the enemy count is above its max
-Touch -> Next Does Not Apply When Grave's Enemy Limit Reached - Graves with the above checked that are touched when at their per-combo enemy limit do NOT go to the next combo if they can't spawn an enemy. They stay as they are and do nothing. If the extant enemies are killed, one may spawn an enemy from the combo THEN and only then may it go to the next combo. This means that you cannot purposefully touch BS-Esque Graves while their enemy cap is reached to "use them up" and invalidate their enemy spawning
Yes, I realize Use New Behaviour enables exactly two other flags - one quite estoteric. Though it leaves room for expansion
(FWIW, both LTTP and LA set precedent for multiple grave combos that spawn different enemies - the former with the Light World/Dark World Poes, and the latter with some graves that release Giant Ghinis. So this is actually a thing real Zeldas do.)

Maybe some flags, "Can only be triggered from /top/down/left/right side."
