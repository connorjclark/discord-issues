a life ring/magic ring/bomb bag/quiver/wallet itemclass that you can select a counter(s) that it regenerates. (and probably add an infinite amount option like the other items)

The 5th time this has been suggested
and the 5th time I have to say "This would require adding 30+ itemclasses"
because it would need a separate itemclass for every single counter
because of how itemclasses WORK
(meta) thread name was changed: ❌🔒Generic Counter Regen Itemclass

hrm
if you use Item Override to put two items of one class of regen ring in two separate subscreen slots, does it only run one of them at once? i'll check later

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/11/2022 13:22

Passive items only run the highest level owned
Period
It has nothing to do with the subscreen
Passive items will run even if not displayed on the subscreen
Completely unrelated

a necessity for any stamina system

it is QR-based whether that holds true for passive item SCRIPTS

and a regen script is... well.... dead simple
```cpp
itemdata script regenCounter
{
    void run(int ctr, int amnt, int time)
    {
        while(true)
        {
            Game->DCounter[ctr] += amnt;
            Waitframes(time);
        }
    }
}```
(It is `+=` on DCounter, right? I always get it mixed up if it should be positive or negative...)

Will that explode if it goes over max?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/11/2022 22:30

it shouldn't be able to
since it's using DCounter
which is engine-based incrementing
