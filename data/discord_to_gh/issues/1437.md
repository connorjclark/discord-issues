Is it possible for ZC to have increase how many quests can be played on one save file? I feel 15 is too meager of a limit. Maybe 60 would work?

no
eventually we hope to do away with the shared save file system entirely
so that, like, each save slot, is its' own save file
(meta) thread name was changed: ❌🔒Save game limit increase
