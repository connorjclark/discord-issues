It seems when the screen is enlarged or full screen, the dmap breaks and it's like, outside of the actual map. It still WORKS, but it's very odd.

Update: It also seems to break the file select screen

Like I can't click on some of them
This is also meaning I can't open some of my quest files 😦 Looks like I have to wait for a fix

=== @ Jared 04/18/2023 21:35

Weirdly enough, I found out it breaks the subscreen editor???

=== @ Moosh 04/18/2023 22:57

Yeah that last one's known.

Subscreen editor's been broken for a bit but it's only visual it seems

=== @ Jared 04/18/2023 23:27

Ah okay good
I think mine is a different bug. When you click on a certain spot it takes you to another. It's weird

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2023 07:39

might be fixed?
or maybe only the zq minimap
not sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2023 21:58

Test in current nightly (about to come out in ~30 mins) please

=== @ Jared 04/19/2023 23:24

Still broken sadly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 14:35

@ Jared If you turn on "Lock Aspect Ratio", does it still occur?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 14:40

I'm REALLY confused by this whole thing
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) frankly I think you need to take a look at this, when you have a moment
(Summary: At large resolutions, the render tree `transform` seems to be working incorrectly?)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 14:42

(Settings: `Scale Force Integer` on, `Lock Aspect Ratio` off. `Lock Aspect Ratio` being on appears to fix the issue, SOMEHOW. I have no idea how.)
(The minimap in the lower-left is a CHILD of the main screen render target, with NO transform of its' own. It should not be offset at all from the main screen, so I am confused as to how it is drawing to the left at all there.)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 14:44

It also completely fucks with clicking, re: `global_to_local_x` etc functions- clicking to place combos on the screen, and to change what screen is selected on the minimap, *appear to work correctly*- clicking on buttons in dialog popups, *does not work correctly*. I have no idea why.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 14:45

My guess is that this is caused in the case of `xscale != yscale`, when it has to stretch differently in each direction?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 14:49

though that doesn't really make that much sense... though it would explain `Lock Aspect Ratio` fixing the issue....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 23:18

Duplicate report: #2330
(meta) thread name was changed: Large resolution screen/click offset
@ DergerSwerson @ Jared For now, enable the setting `Lock Aspect Ratio` in `Etc->Options->Toggles`, as that seems to fix the issue.

=== @ Jared 04/21/2023 17:46

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) It looks like that is already on by default

=== @ Jared 04/21/2023 17:52

Can confirm this is still broken, even changing the options

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 17:52

Really????
That fixes it for me when I make my screen large
what the fuck

=== @ Jared 04/21/2023 17:53

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 17:53

do you also have integer scaling on?

=== @ Jared 04/21/2023 17:53

Clicking two spots to the right

Ummm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 17:54

yes, we already mentioned the cursor offset problem
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "do you also have integer scal…"): ^

=== @ Jared 04/21/2023 17:54

That fixes it but it's very tiny

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1097993115412987945/1099030521973067977/image.png?ex=65eb50ef&is=65d8dbef&hm=139649a89605d2919ff043b2f8b410e21dc5763e0594afd041d44fbb8acaa78e&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 17:55

ahk, so it needs to be both integer scaled and aspect ratio'd to be working correctly
For the record, if you don't have integer scaling on, the graphics will be distorted
which personally makes quest design difficult

=== @ Jared 04/21/2023 17:55

tbh this is super frustrating
Luckily working in the "regular" ZQ size it works totally fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 17:56

I don't know what's wrong here, everything I can see is correct
and it only breaks when the resolution gets large
and only when not integer scaled + aspect ratio'd

=== @ Jared 04/21/2023 17:56

Exactly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 17:57

for now that's the fix I can offer you, I have no clue how to further look into this, it makes no sense and is beyond me

=== @ Jared 04/21/2023 17:57

What else was changed in 4/21 btw?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 17:57

hopefully @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) can take a look and figure something out

=== @ Jared 04/21/2023 17:57

No worries! I can use the big-ish version for now and it works perfectly fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 17:57

(replying to @ Jared "What else was changed in 4/21…"): you can view the commit log on the page

Thank you

first 2 are backend, rest are fairly self-explanatory

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/21/2023 19:14

What about alpha 112
There's been so many changes to the rendering code since then that I don't know where to start
But it's useful to know if it ever worked
