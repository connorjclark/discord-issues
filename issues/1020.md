Guys are already editable in the 2.55 alphas. This allows for you to, for example, change Ama to CSet 7 like in BS Zelda with no scripting or 8-bit mode. I would like to request this to be retained, and for them to be renamed to "Goriya (Guy)" etc. to reduce confusion.
Something else that might also be cool is to allow rooms to have the room's Guy selector read all "Guy" enemies from the enemy list, and allow you to select one, allowing for custom Guys.  I know a lot of people just use invisible Guys and make the graphics as tiles so the Guys don't disappear, but I know users like NightmareJames like to use real Guys and even use scripts to change the room's Guy graphic.

Or in worst-case scenario, just entering the ID # of the enemy to be the Guy. Though it's not idiot-proof

I have no fucking clue
guys are janky jank mcjank

well i mean what does the pick the room guy dialog set
just look there

_suddenly remembers that many eldritch horrors are rumored about the infamous "guys.cpp" file in the source code, which was also among the largest in the code... <\_<'_

I mean, pretty sure that's hardcoded @ P-Tux7

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 17:46

also `guys.cpp` is everything enemy related, not just room guys

=== @ P-Tux7 09/16/2021 17:47

i mean if what setting a guy in the list does is puts a numerical ID in the room as to what enemy to use, then a dialog box that allows setting that would allow for non-default guys

=== @ 4matsy 09/16/2021 17:47

Ah, so that's why the guys were made editable along with the enemies. I was wondering about that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 17:47

guys are jankily made part of enemies
even though they shouldn't realistically be remotely related
because, you know, jank jank mcjank jank

=== @ P-Tux7 09/16/2021 17:54

i mean they do have enemy-like features
they poof in, they can be "hurt", they count as enemies for purposes of door opening (feed the goriya, life or money etc.)

and hookshot chainlinks share a lot with weapons
but they aren't stored in the same spritelist as weapons
