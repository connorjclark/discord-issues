Would it be possible to have a setting for conveyor combos to change their speed? Speed as in, how fast they move Link/ Hero? They could even be able to go so fast that they function as one way conveyors, or alternately "one way" could also be a toggle. Thanks for reading!

it already is possible from dimi
she also added the ability to set both their x and y speeds, meaning that you can have diagonal conveyors of any angle
