@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) you broke a thing

when you changed this
`zscript_had_warn_err` is not being read at all
it is intended to tell it to hold the console open due to *warnings OR errors*
right now, the console only holds open for errors
so you could be getting 5000 compile warnings.... and be entirely unable to read them at all because the compile window instantly closes!

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíWarnings do not display console
marking fixed as I patched it. Feel free to change how its' done if you want it any different, but, it works now, so.
