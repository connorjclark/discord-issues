Basically, this would be a fifth cheat level that tracks whatever items you have when you first enter a dmap. Then, when you use the Goto menu box, you can select a checkbox "Reacquire Entry Items" or "Reacquire Exit Items". The data for this would be saved in a file alongside the quest. The reason for this is that some quests offer complex possibilities as to what you can have upon entering/exiting a dmap, and resetting this via the player data menu over and over can get tedious. This would be the next good step to streamlined debugging after Test Screen.

This is a bit complex for engine cheats
you could do this with a script, though

yeah easy
have a global variable that detects if you have a dummy item (or level item)
if so, give the items, if not, subtract them
