A button In the Recolor tool that allows you to grab all the colors in a tile(s) so that you don't have to put all of them in the "from" line one by one

only works if it has <16 colors, but fair

i mean i doubt i'll have a tile that has more than that lol

=== @ Attempt 11/14/2023 04:05

although i can see it gettin wonky if you're recoloring multiple tiles with different colors from eachother
i guess to make that possibility as least jank as possible it only grabs the first selected's colors

=== @ Attempt 11/14/2023 04:06

since i'm mostly going group-by-group with tiles that have the same colors when i do recolor multiple tiles at once
