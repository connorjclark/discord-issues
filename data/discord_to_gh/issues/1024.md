Init Data needs a rewrite for the new GUI system... here's a channel to discuss what's needed
@ Saffith
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
Firstly, tabpanels are important to a lot, so a widget for those is high priority
For the LItems shit, I'd like to make a special widget for that, to handle it in a better way than using several thousand widgets.... so I'll probably cook something up for that myself.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:32

The main lister proc that lists all the itemclasses is a big one to have
it also uses a bunch of `jwin_vline_proc` / `jwin_hline_proc`....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:34

and of course, text procs need to be limitable to various bounds; `jwin_numedit_short_proc`, `jwin_numedit_byte_proc`, etc

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:35

And they need to be able to handle fixes/floats. Currently, they're just free text or ints.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:35

not needed for init data, I don't think, but in general yes
similarly it needs my swapbtn proc handling

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:35

Yeah, for gravity and terminal velocity.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:35

oh, duh
blehg

=== @ Saffith 09/17/2021 02:39

What does swapbtn do?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:39


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888250462485245952/888252891331199046/unknown.png?ex=65ea7a78&is=65d80578&hm=f451f9f9a4f80d9d2eee59e28a69d84cf7802cceb329ca766cd5cb188126c289&)
it's a button attached to a textfield
which allows converting the textfield between different entry modes
decimal, hex, "long decimal", and "long hex"
the long versions only available for the 32-bit width field with 4 decimal places
this allows entering decimal/hex values for combo attributes and script InitD[]
`jwin_swapbtn_proc`, `jwin_numedit_swap_byte_proc`, `jwin_numedit_swap_sshort_proc`, `jwin_numedit_swap_zsint_proc` are the 4 procs that exist for it presently
the first is the button itself, the rest are textfields which "inherit" from `jwin_numedit_proc`/`jwin_hexedit_proc`
Also, pressing `-` anywhere in the field will not type a `-` at the cursor; instead, it inverts the sign of the value, effectively multiplying by `-1`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:43

a pointer to the swapbtn proc is passed as the `dp3` arg of the textfield
which in turn automatically sets itself to the `dp3` of the button
so they have pointers to each other

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/17/2021 02:55

im not in a good state of mind currently
So I might not chime in

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 02:55

That much was easy.
More interestingly, I *think* I've figured out how to get scrolling panes working.

=== @ Saffith 09/24/2021 04:34

Not ready to merge yet, but it looks like this will work.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2021 04:39

oh my
I was hoping to have, like, a level dropdown
so you could select a certain level, instead of needing hundreds of procs

=== @ Saffith 09/24/2021 04:48

That could also be done.
Just making sure it works at this point.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2021 04:48

nice looking scrollpanel though

=== @ Saffith 09/24/2021 04:49

Still an issue or two to work out, but I'm really glad I finally got it working.
Allegro didn't make it easy.
Nor did jwin_tab_proc.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2021 04:52

oof I can imagine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 11:13

How goes this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 11:20

Having some of these parts to play with would be nice if I want to start making stuff, so getting a merge done would be helpful
Could especially use the tabprocs.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 14:34

...OK, so I just spent like half an hour combing solidly through the new gui code
and I quite believe I understand it well enough to start using it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 12:17

Since you haven't replied in a bit, and I kinda wanted to use tabs, I kinda might have made my own tab gui thing

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888250462485245952/893834076497272892/unknown.png?ex=65ec535a&is=65d9de5a&hm=20b5c6739518cfa40d8472b0c259325a8f4048bbbda2c6431f7292878f2aefb0&)

and woohoo
(If yours is better, then of course I'll just convert anything I make with this over to yours)

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:25

Yeah, sorry, kind of had a week or two of not doing great. I'll try and get things to a mergeable state in the next day or two.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:25

No problem, learned plenty of the gui system building this

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:25

The tab panels basically needed a whole new implementation to work with the scrolling panes,  since jwin_tab_proc locks its contents in place.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:26

Ah, well
Fun thing

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:26

Yep.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:26

My TabPanel implementation
Doesn't use jwin_tab_proc
Or lock things in place

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:27

I'll check it out. I basically just copied jwin_tab_proc and didn't change much more than necessary.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:27

It uses `new_tab_proc`, an edited clone of `jwin_tab_proc`, which takes a `GUI::TabPanel*` instead of a `TabPanel*`
I based it off of `Switcher`, and the proc calls `SwitchTo` directly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:30

Then `QRPanel` inherits from that, but generates it's contents automatically from a `GUI::ListData`
Also, if the tab only has one tab, it doesn't generate a tabproc at all, it just generates the single content within it.
Which, is very useful for the QRs autogenerating

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:31

Sounds good.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:31

Have you done a radioproc yet?

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:31

No.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:31

K, cool
Just starting on that now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:33

Oh, and I literally removed `zq_rules.cpp`
It was *all* dialogs, so it all got replaced by `QRDialog.cpp`

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:34

Excellent. Always nice to be rid of one of those things.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:35

My favorite part
Is how easy setting up the dialog for ScriptRules
Once QuestRules was done
Literally just making another couple ListDatas

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:37

Oh, and I needed to make a special checkbox
`checkbox_qr`
It stores `int qr;`, an onToggle, it messages `qr` instead of the selected state
Then the dialog just does `toggleBit(local_qrs, messageArg);`

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:38

Ah, yeah. I was thinking it might be useful to add a UserData field or something for cases like that.
Similar issue with item checkboxes in init. data.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:39

Aye, that'd be better in general
But I wasn't quite about to try making that big a change
Hell, it took me a couple hours of poking to figure out `builder.h`

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:40

Ah, yeah. That bit's fun.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:40

Really fancy macro shit, dude
This thing is ART

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:41

I wrote that a few years ago and had to figure out again when I adapted it to ZC.
Kind of can't believe I managed it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:42

Glad I've taken the time to figure it out
I'm ready to do a ton of converting to this system
Oh, also, I expanded `flags` to `:5`

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:43

Figured 4 wouldn't last that long.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:43

Added `f_DISABLED`, because the QR pane needs greyed out boxes for filler

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:44

I'm wondering about the feasibility of a widget that runs a whole inner DIALOG array...
That might be useful for things of unpredictably varying size.
But it's not urgent.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:45

I mean,  the QR panel is unpredictability varying
And it works fine

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:46

Things also don't know their parents yet, so there's also currently no way for a scrolling pane to know if the size of its content has changed.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:46

It has whatever size listdata you give it of active checkboxes
Ah, aye

=== @ Saffith 10/03/2021 03:46

Plenty of stuff to be done.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 03:46

My tabpanel gets around that
Since it gives the tabproc a pointer to the widget
But adding a parent system shouldn't be hard
I can do that when I finish radio buttons

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2021 05:37

oh, also
you had `_lpx` as a measurement
I added `_spx` as the inverse

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 17:07

So, I've started my own build of this
counters tab is done
albeit, a scrollpanel would significantly improve it in smallmode

large mode is simple, all 25 script counters are visible at once

...small mode is more painful.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 17:09

...err, ignore the window title, didn't update lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 17:12

pushing incrementally to `2.55-qrdlg` as I finish bits here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:57

K, got more done

Had to add `FIXED_DECIMAL` type to textfields
I gave it a `places` parameter, which defaults to 4; but for grav/termv here, they are set to `2`.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 11:24

OK
And LItems

Similar to how it was done previously, but with buttons instead of tabs.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 11:27


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888250462485245952/894908566098546730/unknown.png?ex=65e7018c&is=65d48c8c&hm=a79ad1cb89483f6c95e6baeefd0effb6b8886801f5b63d27e70dd04a6612a909&)
fits nice and snugly in small mode, too

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888250462485245952/894908669991481355/unknown.png?ex=65e701a5&is=65d48ca5&hm=4c950495888e40c8fdfa287bccb945e3f6c89a22f900bec3ee354ad94d20d2a4&)
and, if you try to go too high, it bounds you (offset max is `510`)
and on the exact value of `510`, it hides the fields that won't be usable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 11:29

Just have `Misc` and `Equipment` left.
`Misc` is gonna be a lot of figuring out how to lay it out smartly, because that's just a bunch of *junk*
and `Equipment` will be the big boss of this dialog creation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 11:30

....I'm probably going to make a switcher with 512 children.
have each child be a grid/column/etc, that I can add checkboxes to iteratively

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 15:36


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888250462485245952/894971370994302986/unknown.png?ex=65e73c0a&is=65d4c70a&hm=e5e43346cc8e3020d5ab1bbeaf5ae449d046c4f57d93ace915c314f3359e8dee&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 18:51

So, now that I have saff's stuff merged, time to tackle `Equipment`
Firstly, I wanted to make a new `ListData` generator for itemclasses

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888250462485245952/895020609703137350/unknown.png?ex=65e769e6&is=65d4f4e6&hm=f3820998c1226ae94232903d5f4c6653a4f73ad42587084e8dc6e8392b055f72&)
which works perfectly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 18:53

except not alphabetized yet

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 19:05


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888250462485245952/895023816357597235/unknown.png?ex=65e76ce2&is=65d4f7e2&hm=c1dcbcd791c3fd719ece12df735c1fc5b42ff221c3a02dacd6653fd25c4c9c6d&)
now alphabetized
Basically, I added:```cpp
private:
    ListData::ListData(){}
    void add(ListItem item) {listItems.push_back(item);}
    void add(std::string name, int val) {listItems.emplace_back(name, val);};
    void add(std::string name, int val, std::string desc) {listItems.emplace_back(name, val,desc);};
```
A static member function is being used to construct the list, so it has access to these for its' purposes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 19:42

....and now I've added `removeVal(int key)` to delete an item from a targetted list
so, I can generate the full itemclass list, and then remove any that have no items to show

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 19:52


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888250462485245952/895035767418658816/unknown.png?ex=65e77803&is=65d50303&hm=d1ecf4fc789fb00706f54a75f42d274d155d311dfe40338516c003d01acce732&)
OK, so, well, it sort of works
except for the whole always showing swords part

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 19:56

(given swords are IC 0, it's just not switching when I click... because I forgot to add the call to the onSelectFunc to lists.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 20:17

this switcher is certainly giving me issues....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 20:32

oh, the list proc isn't messaging `geCHANGED_SELECTION`....

......
So one problem
I opened the dialog in ZC (as the cheat dialog)
and
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/704505093428478013/895055516194209812/unknown.png
it DOESN'T fit there
.....and the user can fully customize that resx/resy
I've split the script tab because it's by far the largest

still fits comfortably in MY zc resolution

OK, now
I've added `bool isZC` as a param to the dialog
and disabled the fields that should not be active in cheat menu

(Some things in Misc were disabled before, but I made a small change to allow them to work; some things in Vars weren't disabled before, but weren't functional because they *should* have been.
all-in-all, this should be done, and I'm gonna merge it down

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 21:38

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) including the new merge, there are *0* conflicts with your sideview swimming branch; so none of this broke anything there

...oh

slight problem
closing that leaves it's draws on the purple

Ahk, fixed
@ Saffith I added some interconnection
Now, `Widget` has `DialogRunner *owner;`, default `NULL`
`Widget::realize()` does `owner = runner;`
and, I gave `DialogRunner` a couple bool states to keep track of, which any widget can access
(through a wrapper function which gives a default return if `owner` is null, to avoid nullpo)
....thus, we now have `bool allowDraw()`, which must return true before anything is allowed to draw to the screen.
which prevents the garbage draws in the above screenshot
