=== @ Jared 10/16/2022 18:58

For some reason, the L button sometimes work with pickup combos. It also doesn't allow for throwing. (Emily, this was the problem apparently)

=== @ Jared 10/16/2022 19:08

Same thing happens with Y, except you jsut can't throw it

=== @ Jared 10/16/2022 19:10

...Apparently if you change maps, you can throw it. Weird

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2022 19:20

....what the fuck?
are you sure you don't have a script interfering in any way?

=== @ Jared 10/16/2022 22:59

All I'm using is cliff jump and hurt sfx

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2022 23:38

I'll need the quest

=== @ Jared 10/16/2022 23:45

I‚Äôll send it to you in a DM

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 19:33

I...
am so confused
what iN THE EVER LIVING FUCK IS HAPPENING

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 19:49

Ah
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
you broke this
when you added replay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 19:51

something to do with this isn't working at all
whatever the hell you did here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 19:53

....hmmm wait
maybe not
.....ohhhhh wait I understand
sorry connor, nevermind. Your change just made me not know what the fuck was happening, but nope, this would have been an issue before
bleh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 19:59

So, the problem here is
the `rButton` function
is a jank fucking mess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 20:01

and the flag for press is *never cleared* unless it tries to call that button
I have *2* fixes for this
I'm going to implement the cleaner one now, which is:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031279970175164498/1031658341249847296/unknown.png?ex=65e628b3&is=65d3b3b3&hm=a0f0c5771f67fb57ef11618440c6786156d2ba888a888bed2a84025566979502&)
clearing the `down_control_states` in `load_control_state()`
...In case that has some issue with your replay code, connor, I'll post the other (jankier) solution here for reference
which is to change this:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031279970175164498/1031658643218771968/unknown.png?ex=65e628fb&is=65d3b3fb&hm=0228939795297675a744c2837bc1183287e0f8ba2b34cee3262f84c999a20ae4&)
to this:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031279970175164498/1031658706070425711/unknown.png?ex=65e6290a&is=65d3b40a&hm=fc83b59027363a2d14c044727850ccb88faad90129185f370189fd510d332f17&)
not gonna do that now, because having a `peek` function do any more than, well, *read* the value, seems wrong/jank
but if the other solution causes issues, this is the backup fix

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 20:08

@ Jared fixed for next build. This would have affected many buttons.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 20:11

Did you run the replay tests first?
touching input might impact the replays slightly (maybe not, I didn't fully read the issue here)
Maybe not even using L/R yet in any replays hehe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 20:12

how do I run the replay tests
aside from pushing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 20:13

it's all documented in the python script
in `tests` folder

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 20:14

I don't have python installed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 20:14

Given how I know you like to build in-folder you'll need to set `--build_output .` i think
or whereever your binaries end up
install python 3

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 20:14

...probably just easier to push and let it run the tests for me on gh?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 20:15

You could just run each replay file manually with `-assert`
yeah that works too, as long as it's in a branch so we keep master branch clean from "fixed CI" commits
I wouldn't say it's easier tho...python is a simple install. all the script does is automate running each replay with `-assert` and print the results prettily, you can just run it directly too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 20:17

my brain is just not ready to handle shit right now
I had enough energy to tackle these bugs
not enough to set up new tests and shit
or install shit
so

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 20:17

I forgot windows doesn't just come with python
macs have me spoiled

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 20:59

both of the classic replays failed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 21:00

`classic_1st_lvl1.zplay` early at frame 1912

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 21:02

Perhaps it can be fixed by replaying just a screen or two. I'll try later.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/17/2022 21:42

k

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 23:27

Looking more closely at how lvl1.zplay is failing, ~~it seems this patch isn't what we want.~~
The replay file shows that "Up" is held down, so the player Y coord should be changing every frame, but with this patch it doesn't for some reason (I think only when an enemy is encountered/the sword is swung? not sure)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 23:31

i'll try recording a frame-by-frame so this is easier to understand...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 23:50

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 23:58

A is pressed down on frame 1910, but only in the changed version does it swing on frame 1912.

I guess that's the bug in action.
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Looking more closely at how l‚Ä¶"): so now I'm thinking, no, this is the right change. Just gotta re-record some screens.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/17/2022 23:59

If I had to guess I'd think the attack animation would start on frame 1911 not 1912...but w.e.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2022 00:06

such a weird bug
randomly ignoring input based on if no game logic ran recently to try to read such input

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2022 00:08

@ Jared you discovered a monstrous bug

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2022 00:14

@ DeletedUser hold off on more replays until this is fixed in a nightly.

I can manually fix what you've done so far

=== @ NightmareJames 10/18/2022 00:18

Awwwwwwwwwwwwww @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) , I was just about to start.  üòù

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2022 01:53

I'm fixing the replays now
mostly deleting some A inputs that were prev. ignored

=== @ NightmareJames 10/18/2022 01:56

Well, I found another bug anyway, haha, stumbled upon one
(not in replays)
Emily's on it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2022 02:55

I'm not certain the new button behavior "feels" right. Like attacking seems too fast? @ DeletedUser could you play with a test build I'm about to upload and let me know what you think?

=== @ NightmareJames 10/18/2022 02:59

It'll have to be tomorrow
I already took the glasses off for now
Feeling a little crummy now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2022 03:57

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I'm fixing the replays now"): well that was a PITA

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2022 04:00

(replying to @ NightmareJames "It'll have to be tomorrow"): OK, for tomorrow: https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/connorjclark-nightly-2022-10-18

=== @ Jared 10/18/2022 07:44

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@ Jared you dis‚Ä¶"): Just my luck lol

=== @ NightmareJames 10/18/2022 17:24

Welcome to ZC Development @ Jared .  Be proud of yourself.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/18/2022 17:55

@ DeletedUser says it feels more responsive, so good enough for me. I merged the PR and started a nightly.
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) feel free to do an alpha whenever

=== @ Jared 10/20/2022 19:33

L still doesn't seem to be working for me in the latest build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2022 19:04

(replying to @ Jared "L still doesn't seem to be wo‚Ä¶"): Is this checked or not? (it should be checked)

=== @ Jared 10/22/2022 19:22

Oh okay let me try it later
It might be turned off

=== @ Jared 10/23/2022 00:20

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) works! Don't seem to show an animation on breaking though

=== @ Jared 10/23/2022 00:22

Ah, it's in the combo
