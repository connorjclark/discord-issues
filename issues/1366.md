=== @ Moosh 01/24/2022 21:07

I've got no idea how remotely feasible this is, but I had a dream it got added in a new build and it was really cool. The idea would be an option in ZQuest that launches ZC in a special test play mode where:
-The title screen and file select are skipped
-All forms of saving do nothing and retry closes the program. Nothing writes to zc.sav
-Level 4 cheat is on by default
-Link spawns on the current screen viewed in ZQuest, either using a Test Play DMap specified in init data or the first valid DMap using the current map and palette
This would be invaluable for both testing individual screen setups in dungeons and making small script test quests that don't need long term saves

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2022 21:08

This.... sounds fancy as shit
There are other fancy things higher than this on the list, though
....perhaps when I have time to look into it....

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2022 21:08

Fair enough. I think the new launcher followed me into my dreams xD

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/24/2022 21:09

One of the big things is, anything to do with how the new launcher creates processes, won't work at all on linux, I'm pretty sure
. . . actually looking at getting a linux VM set up now....

=== @ cbailey78 01/25/2022 02:19

I remember way back in 2003 or 2004 that it had a "Test" in the file menu at one time but crashed the program and didn't work, so it got taken out.

=== @ mitchfork 01/25/2022 03:20

yeah this would be excellent
even if it didn't start you on the current screen and just quick launched the quest w/ no save file that would be huge for script testing

=== @ cbailey78 01/25/2022 04:58

I would recommend it to start you on the screen zquest is on or give you an option to start at the Dmap continue point.

=== @ DergerSwerson 01/26/2022 10:55

this was actually a feature that Dark Nation(third ZC Dev)  wanted to add at some point, but never got around to.

=== @ DergerSwerson 01/26/2022 11:27

either way, this idea reeks of perfection. please consider. Constantly opening ZC and skipping the title is getting old

=== @ cbailey78 01/26/2022 17:56

(replying to @ DergerSwerson "either way, this idea reeks o‚Ä¶"): Ditto!  Especially making large quests involving scripting debugging if an issue arises causing you to go back and forth testing.

Appear to have this much working
So, command-line setup for `-test "quest_file" start_dmap start_screen`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 11:10

if you ever try to exit to the title screen, it just reloads the quest
if you save, it *does* save, but not to any file
after saving, any 'reload' of the quest will load that save, until you exit the program, at which point the save data is discarded
cheat level 4 is automatically enabled

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 11:11

ooooh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 11:12

Now I need to hook this to a process call in ZQ
and all of this gets added to the pile of *eventually need to rewrite all of it for linux*
...well, any of the process-management stuff, specifically
I can add more parameters easily, if needed for anything

It pre-fills `Start Screen` with the current screen, and `Start DMap` with the first dmap that matches the current map (going to make it tiebreak with palette next)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 12:16

k, now it should prioritize a dmap that has the correct palette and map over just the first to match the map
but of course you can override it to whatever dmap you want in the dialog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 12:19

also adding favorite command `Test Quest`
also, if you try to test when you have unsaved changes....
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935279555994869832/940944977482108948/unknown.png?ex=65e85f4c&is=65d5ea4c&hm=4e05fddd9f91fd64964afc4e3a9b1da20d4b2e061570da53100a213155eb16d4&)
And if you try to test on a quest that has *never* been saved, it does yet another different thing; in that case, it just opens the `Save As` dialog. If you don't save, it won't let you test, as there's no quest file *to* open.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 12:23

fancy!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 12:25

For the record, basically what it does
is the same as when you make a new save file for the quest
except, it overrides the zinit continue dmap / screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 12:33

Also, if you try to run a test while a previous test is open, it will kill the old test process (though it won't kill any console attached to the test process, and not much I can do about that)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 12:41

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 12:51

Already? Goddamn
I'm hyped to check this out

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 12:53

Does it have a boolean for reading if it's in test play mode in ZScript? Forget if I mentioned that idea but sounds like it'd be simple. And remove the need for `const bool DEBUG` üòÑ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 12:56

...that would be smart. Frankly adding a new bool to zscript is far more tedious than the work to get this working, lol XD

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 12:58

Okay, trying out the test play on my existing quest appears to have given the global script a stroke. It did a bunch of messed up stuff seemingly indicating a corrupted global array

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 12:59

running it by launching ZC the old way still works though, seemingly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:00

Oh?
hmmm
guessing something's wrong with the `global script Init`

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:00

As does launching from the blank save slot that was apparently generated by the test play session (that one sounds like a bug)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:01

Oh???? It modified the save file?
Uhhh
WTF

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:02

Created one to be precise. I ran it on a fresh install, gonna test if it can overwrite existing saves

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:02

It shouldn't create or write anything
it should never reach save writing code

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:03

Oh yup, it's just completely overwriting zc.sav
good thing I checked D:

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:04

....oh fek I'm a dumbass.

@ Moosh does this fix the save issues?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:09

(replying to @ Moosh "Okay, trying out the test pla‚Ä¶"): gonna need more details on this, as the init script is most definitely running...

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:09

Seems to open zelda.exe then immediately close it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:10

Anything in the zelda.exe log?

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:10

Until I opened it once normally and now it's working

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:10

(If it doesn't open one, you might need to open zc, and open the zscript debugger from the menu, so it opens on launch each time)
hmm?
odd

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:11

Guessing it needed some setting I had to run the program normally to set

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:12

it should be doing literally everything that it does normally
except checking for a save file
because it doesn't use one

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:13

No idea what that was then, but that part is working consistently now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:13

Still having global script issues?

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:13

Yeah, those are tricky given that it's not working at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:13

basic tests give me no issues whatsoever

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:14

`Invalid pointer (0) passed to array (don't change the values of your array pointers)`
Getting a lot of this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:15

nothing should be different literally at all
so this is kinda baffling

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:15

Active effects going awry seem to be tied to detecting when the current screen changes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:15

????

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:16

Which I guess if my global array is invalid would check out. It's doing this
`if(G[G_LASTSCREEN]!=Game->GetCurScreen()||G[G_LASTDMAP]!=Game->GetCurDMap()){`
So it thinks the screen is changing every frame presumably because G doesn't exist

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:17

gah
but why would your array be invalid?
the init script should be running fine

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:17

indeed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:18

Can you get it to bug out with a simpler test?

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:19

trying that now
ah yes. trivially simple to trigger it would seem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:20

Oh? What's the trigger?

Whole lotta not a single error

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:21

So it's working for you? Uhhhhhhhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:21

When you updated to the buildpack, did you update the whole thing, or only copy some files?
If so, which files?

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:21

Copied the whole zip

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:21

....hmmm
I figured you might have missed `zscript.exe`
but no, that would have given you far more errors

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:22

Can try doing it again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:22

might as well
Also, for the record, `ClearTrace()` now clears the console as well

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:23

Oh! dope

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:25

Yeah same results :/

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:25

What the fuck?

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:29

Just to be sure we're talking the same thing, these traces you did were in test play mode on the quest file I sent?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:29

yes

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:29

spooky
And it works as intended when running the file normally, same as my quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:30


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935279555994869832/940962838996992041/2022-02-09_08-29-49.mp4?ex=65e86fef&is=65d5faef&hm=a6fb74565ac36aab88c555eb2a3056cbfa602e0b105e86775c1cd34151c79520&)
let me rebuild from clean
also, new build will have `bool Debug->Testing;` available to zscript, read-only

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:31

alright. sorry for all the trouble. feels like I had to have done something wrong here :/
And excellent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:35

@ Moosh

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935279555994869832/940964186832396348/buildpack.zip?ex=65e87130&is=65d5fc30&hm=2279ea003468b012d28d92e21de4ae51a4b1031f510bfaad3e9a91716c042bb3&

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:36

Still no issues in your test
Adding `if(Debug->Testing) ClearTrace();` above the `while(true)` indeed clears the console on the global script starting, only if launched in testing mode

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:38

ffffuck, still broken on my end
gonna try one more thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:42

Odd question, but what is the full path of your ZC folder?

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:42

`C:\Users\64pok\Desktop\Zelda Classic Dev Env\_TESTS`
Tried making a fully new folder as well, clean install, recompile scripts, same as before
Might need some additional input on this one. It's seeming my computer may be haunted

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:44

51 character path
so nowhere near the 512 it would need to buffer overflow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:45

oh
hmmmmmm
I'm very confused
because I just replicated it
and I'm not sure what is different

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 13:46

Well that's reassuringly worrying

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:49

. . . yeah, the init script is not running
what the fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 13:51

....it's a config of some sort
what the FUCK
Now I have it where it isn't launching
like you did before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:00

OK
So
The reason it was only broken in some cases was some sort of random memory
think it's fixed

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935279555994869832/940970734677786704/zelda.exe?ex=65e87749&is=65d60249&hm=a8cdd423dde2102b807f4a2b53191ef4278c3be54835c6d484b4ffbfc5ffdcff&
@ Moosh hopefully?

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:03

It's working!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:04

So, the global `Quit` value was fucked
and depending on config files (because random memory happened to overlap with something config related)
it had an error quitstate during init
thus, `run_script`?
```cpp
int32_t run_script(const byte type, const word script, const int32_t i)
{
    if(Quit==qRESET || Quit==qEXIT) // In case an earlier script hung
        return RUNSCRIPT_ERROR;```
well, that was instantly returning
because it happened to be one of those two values
so the init script never ran
but THEN `Quit` was cleared, and the rest of everything proceeded normally
just had to clear it a tad earlier

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:06

I see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:06

oh
actually
it had to be `qRESET` specifically
it was probably `qEXIT` before, when it was opening and instantly exiting
because that would skip the main loop *entirely*
and when you launched it normally, it wrote something to a config file
which changed the random memory
thus changing the value to `qRESET`
which, now could launch, but still broke the init script
fucks sake memory issues are terrible

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:12

This is actual magic playing around with this thing. Just picking out random screens in the quest and going there instantly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:12

also, the save now is named `Hero`
(it was blank before, as you noted when it was overwriting zc.sav)

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:13

For quests that access the filename for strings I assume. That's pretty smart

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:14

Scripts can overwrite it custom easily enough, too
```cpp
global script Init
{
    void run()
    {
        if(Debug->Testing) Game->SetName("FooBar");
    }
}```

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:16

I'm one of the few people who's done this I figure. For the Bananas name entry gag üòÑ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:16

Yuurand uses it for automatic character selection
MM2D used it to enable debug mode
(Or rather, *disable* debug mode)
(any file named `Link` started with only the basic inventory, while any other file started with everything)

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:17

Nah, I mean _writing_ to the name. Plenty of quests read it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 14:18

oh, duh
`THIEF`
most classic example

=== @ Moosh 02/09/2022 14:18

Tis where I got the idea
