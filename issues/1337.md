Normal Freeform Combos bug out, by 4 by 4 tiles by default and Not by 1 by 1 in tile size when you try to place a 1 by 1 FFC.   This is in New Alpha 2.55   101

I did a test starting a fresh new quest to test this out.
Try placing a single 1 by 1 FFC and see what happens.

I'm using FFC alot more lately, so i noticed this.

Again, this happens when you place a fresh FFC.
