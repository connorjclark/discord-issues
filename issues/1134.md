Requesting Armos working on layers now that layer stuff is being worked on. Both me and @ Dwaggy are interested in this
(btw falco, the reason i said there's layer stuff being worked on is that emily just got pushblocks working on layers - including them producing their layer's screen's undercombo beneath them)

cool, cool
why was I interested in this again? 🙂
*doesn't remember*
I remember being interested in walkable armos combos...

=== @ King Aquamentus 10/23/2021 21:46

that is cool though

Pushblocks were dead easy.... armos look a *lot* harder

=== @ King Aquamentus 10/23/2021 21:54

you sure it was me, P-Tux?
Like I said, I remember suggesting armos combos be available to trigger as walkable combos (as in, you walk across them, and an enemy spawns)
I don't remember layers though

Believe 2.55 can already do that can't it? Just with a step->next into generic with enemy spawning

=== @ King Aquamentus 10/23/2021 21:55

well
I ended up sort of half and halfing it with walkability. As in, checkerboard patterning the walkability of the combo
somehow that actually worked

=== @ P-Tux7 10/23/2021 21:59

that might be problematic if spawning enemies can hurt you

=== @ King Aquamentus 10/23/2021 22:08

They dont.
Mine don't anyways
Quest rules.
Or... something
It's been a minute
But I do know I didn't have trouble with that when I got things going
It was utilized to simulate gels coming out of the floor like in Alttp, and actually worked nicely
