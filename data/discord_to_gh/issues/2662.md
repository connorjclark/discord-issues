Alpha 118
Self explanatory. The ``[Counter] Gauge`` subscreen elements always operate as if the ``Mod`` checkbox is always ticked on for all four slots. The life gauge on the subscreen has the ``Cap`` and ``After Cap`` tiles set to 0 and ``Mod`` checkbox as off, which results in this lovely vomit on any containers past the current maximum.

I am a fool
Disregard. I realized my error
This is meant to be intentional x.x

That said the tiles show up blank in the edit widget dialgue when assigned to Tile 0, which tripped me up

...aye, I suppose the issue is that tile 0 is usually invisible but isn't for this

and still shows invis in the gui
