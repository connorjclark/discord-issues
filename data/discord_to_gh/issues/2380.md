Flags for Potion and Bottle items that make the screen not freeze when they are used. Deduction of counters while they are getting filled (for example, getting hit while using a potion) would likely reuse the same code as pickup item refills such as rupees and magic jars, which I believe is smart enough to deduct the spent money/magic from the full refill.
This is mostly meant for Aslion's scripted bottle ideas, which I can see being useful for scripting something like spawning the bees from LTTP when using a bottle.

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Flags for Potion and Bottle i…"): err, it would just be instant fill
