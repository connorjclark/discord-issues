First matter: renaming the combo type to Speed Modifier

Flags:
-Multiplicative: The player's speed is multiplied by the Speed attribute while on this combo.
-Additive: The Speed attribute is added to the player's step speed while on this combo. Can stack with the above.
-Set Speed: The player's step speed is set absolutely to the Speed attribute while on this combo. This overrides any of the previous two values' effects on player step speed.
-Is Affected by Boots: Boots can negate the effects of this combo. The minimum level of Boots needed to negate the effects is an attribute. If this flag is unchecked, the combo does not check for the presence of Boot items and thus they cannot negate its effects.

Attributes:
-Speed (a float): Used for the above calculations.
-Boot Level (an int): Boots of this level are needed to negate the combo's effects.

All imported quests' Slow Walk combos have Multiplicative checked, a Speed attribute of 0.5, and a Boot Level attribute of 0.

The many different kinds of effects on player step speed are meant to syngerize with quests that give the player multiple step speeds, for example, quests that modify player step speed to fake multiple player characters or classes.

This will only work with new hero movement set
but, certainly seems doable

No problem

I remembered this when the ice pushblock stuff was discussed, and this is honestly what i'm more interested in

mm, yeah, this does sound good to add too. definitely deserves the bump
probably not devving any today, but when I've got the energy, these 3 things will be high on my list (if y'all put in the other 2 feature requests)
