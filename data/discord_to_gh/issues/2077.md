Noticed a failure late in `layered_first_quest.zplay` (as of now, untested in CI because of time limits).

Bisected to:

```
commit 8a843416c321cc3f508f794dd731fad13dda364d
Author: DimiPZC <joshuaf@live.ca>
Date:   Wed Nov 30 04:03:17 2022 -0500

    Make Switchhooks and Hookshots work with FFCs
```

Here is the HTML comparison report: https://ugliest-sisters.surge.sh/ (apoligies for the rude randomly generated url, lol)

Clearly, the Wizzrobe projectile reflects in the wrong direction.

(`local-0` track is the baseline, `local-1` track is the unexpected replay result)
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/09/2022 23:23

so local_0 is before the switchhook commit?
odd... I'll have a look in the morning

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2022 23:26

Yup! The first track is always the baseline.
I need to change the names to something better, later.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/11/2022 23:17

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) did you take a look at this yet?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/11/2022 23:18

oops, forgot about this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 20:06

need to find the energy to look at this; it's probably a simple change but I've been feeling overwhelmed the past few days

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 22:27

wh-why would it be breaking???
I didn't even touch Mirror code in that commit...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/12/2022 22:41

what code handles projecticles/weapons reflecting off mirrors?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 22:43

Weapons.cpp; enemy magic reflecting off it would be line 6116

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/12/2022 22:45

I can help, but could you whip up a qst that has an enemy doing projectiles against mirrors? Or maybe it is also a thing for lweapons, that'd be simpler to test
Idk if mirrors are set up in the new quest file

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 22:47

okay yeah enemies reflecting on mirror combos is broken

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 22:51

wait shit that might be saved in a later branch, lemme send one made in main

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 22:52

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 22:56

hold on, am I... I think I have a hunch

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 23:02

Okay, so that commit seems to be when solidobject got dir moved into it
and I think the problem has to do with copying dir

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 23:04

...I don't think it's calling the copy constructor for solid objects

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 23:06

Okay, that fixed the thing not reflecting properly

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 23:08

the problem now is that the graphics don't seem to rotate properly

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 23:09

(trying to push but the personal access token is giving me trouble)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/12/2022 23:13

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
Can you wait a minute?
just a small thing I wanna push first for CI
Actually, nevermind

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 23:19

It doesn't matter, I can't push
I don't know how to get smartgit to accept a fine grained token

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/12/2022 23:22

Did you change a workflow .yml or something?
That's usually the only time I get token problems (until I fixed it with `gh auth` in github cli tool)
You can always open a PR instead.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 23:25

supposedly you changed the repo to require fine grained tokens instead of the old style of tokens
because the overhead thing you added needed it or something? That's what I heard from Emily anyways

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/12/2022 23:27

Try now?
When the fine grained token thing was enabled, the onboarding flow had a bunch of defaults I just accepted.
I turned back on the classic tokens.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 23:29

I can push now
thanks!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 23:34

curious if this fails the replay test

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/12/2022 23:35

I currently limited the test in CI to stop before this problematic frame.
You can run it locally though to see.
It's a long one, though.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 23:37

ooof

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2022 00:08

Okay I think I was just a massive moron with how I implemented the autorotate stuff
cause I don't think I understood this thing called copy constructors
and that you need to copy all the variables
hopefully this doesn't break replays...
great catches though, would never have caught these without the replay desyncs

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2022 00:12

should hopefully be fixed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/13/2022 00:14

we really should not be defining copy ctors ourselves, unless there is dynamic memory involved
which object was this?
If we simply deleted it it would be bug-free and faster probably
Assuming it has no pointers
(default copy ctors are a thing)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/13/2022 09:09

Replay works now.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2022 13:31

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "which object was this?"): sprite (sprite.cpp) and solid_object (solid_object.cpp)
