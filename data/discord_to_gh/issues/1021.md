I don't see why this isn't a thing already in Zquest's midi menu. I would like to request the ability to move midi entries up and down the list via ctrl+up and ctrl+down and the ability to copy and paste midi entries in zquest's midi list via ctrl+c and ctrl+v
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Sorry to pester you again but I figure you would probably be interested in seeing this.

love that you ping me as I'm already reading it XD

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/16/2021 16:35

sorry.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2021 16:35

nothing to apologize for, just funny timing

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/16/2021 16:35

Also I hope this QOL suggestion isn't too much

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/16/2021 16:36

I kinda like to keep my quest midi list tidy and the lack of these features kinda make that impossible.

Any progress on this?

any progress on this one?

Nope, not yet

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 07:35

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "I don't see why this isn't a…"): Do any menus in ZC already have `ctrl+up`/`ctrl+down` for anything like this?

...I tried adding copy/paste here, and it just crashed. Don't have the energy to get this crap working, MIDIs are terrible to work with
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) can feel free
if she feels like

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2021 08:56

see the best part is because I read all these pings, the ping disappears and I forget where I was pinged
so in the end, I save myself from suffering via my lack of memory

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 08:57

lol
but yeah, so, the problem I immediately see
is midis are pointers
that have within them pointers to tracks
and I thought I understood it well enough copying the code that existed already
but then it just crashed
and I went `nope`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 09:00

(meta) thread name was changed: midi copy-pasting + moving entries

=== @ FireSeraphim 07/22/2022 09:12

bump
