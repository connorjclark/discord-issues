Would it be possible to get a universal Test Quest hotkey? Possibly F1 or something (would probably be way more useful than the shortcut to the user reference doc)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/26/2022 02:55

you can put it as a favorite command
or press `Alt+Q, T`

=== @ aslion 04/26/2022 02:58

small mode tho
just would be nice as a one button command for such a useful feature

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/26/2022 03:07

if `T` were available I'd give it that, but that's tile editor
every F key is taken

=== @ Alucard648 04/26/2022 04:00

Shift+F5

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/26/2022 04:06

frankly, why is `Alt+Q, T` a problem?

=== @ aslion 04/26/2022 17:11

I mean I wouldn't say it's a *problem*

=== @ aslion 04/26/2022 17:13

It's just like, comparatively complicated in relation to how often it's used

=== @ aslion 04/26/2022 17:18

Like I probably use it on average 3-4 times per screen if not way more yet it's as "hard" to get to as the Enemy Editor or something that's less frequently used

=== @ aslion 04/26/2022 17:19

And all F1 does is like, bring up a help doc for 2.50 that you'd be better off reading in a text editor anyway
and probably used like, exclusively on accident
It's not a huge deal or anything, just would be a nice QoL feature
but really not a pressing issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/26/2022 20:57

F1 is a standardized hotkey, though
you can press it in Discord, Chrome, MS Word, etc to always get a help doc
and, frankly, as a large mode user
I have `Test Quest` on my favorite commands....
but I still press `Alt+Q, T` most of the time because it's fatser

=== @ aslion 04/27/2022 04:04

I mean who cares about if it's standardized it sucks

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/27/2022 04:09

well what about the keyboard key j?
thats unused
?
alternatively having hotkeys for every favorite command (alt + number or something) could alleviate the issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/27/2022 04:11

you can't even assign favorite commands in small mode though

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/27/2022 04:40

Couldn't you still technically set them in the config file though?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/27/2022 04:43

yes, technically
