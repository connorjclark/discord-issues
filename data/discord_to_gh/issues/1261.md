ZC lacks some animation frames that Z3 did, even if you set "Z3 Player Animation". It's divided into existing animation slots that need to have expanded frames, and things that require whole new animation slots.

Expansion of existing slots:

Floating - 2 frames per direction
Swimming: 4 frames per direction
Slash: 6 frames up/down, 7 frames left/right (set to 6 for all four???)
Pound: 3 exclusive frames to each direction. Not shared with stab/slash like they currently are

New slots:
Boomerang: 2 frames per direction
Hookshot: 1 frame per direction
Bug net: 7 frames per direction
Bow: 3 frames per direction (might be worth waiting until we have visible sprite bows?)

And a final note that the rods and canes both reuse the pound animation.
oops pressed enter too soon
