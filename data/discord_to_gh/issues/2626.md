Doesn't seem to already be a thing but it'd be cool if you could assign shields to a specific button the same way you can for the Roc's Feather and Lift Glove.  Obviously would only work when the "Active Use" flag is assigned.

could this feature just be generalizable somehow? make it so you can specify any item to always work with specific buttons
