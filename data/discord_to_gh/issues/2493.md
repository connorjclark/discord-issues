In the following script, foo has an array of pointers to 100 bar. Both foo and bar are being created as global objects but while the foo persists through an F6, bar is not so fortunate. All 100 indices of the array get set to -1

Ah...I assumed wrong. It's not the classes but arrays specifically

=== @ Moosh 07/06/2023 08:22

(meta) thread name was changed: Arrays in a global object do not persist through F6
Also discord didn't actually embed the script looks like. bleh

What build was this tested in, and if the latest nightly, can you also test the nightly before that?

Also, I'm just gonna note the stupid ass fucking thing here..... It seems to break on `Continue` but NOT `Save`??

@ Moosh can you check this again?
I fixed some bugs recently that Deathrider reported, which were caused by the recent script engine data refactor
Very likely related to this.

Nope, still bork

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 00:56

shucks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/10/2023 02:40

no, something is clearing `user_objects` on continue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/10/2023 17:30

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> `FFScript::deallocateAllArrays()` shouldn't be clearing all objectRAM... that needs to only occur on non-continue exits

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/10/2023 17:40

@ Moosh fixed
