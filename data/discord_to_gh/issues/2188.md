A combo type that can spawn enemies in more convenient and varied ways than a mere combo that auto-triggers and spawns an enemy upon triggering. The current way might be overlooked by new users due to requiring thinking outside the box. I want this to be a more apparent option to new users because it is great for many ideas - undercombos that spawn enemies under pushed rocks, combo cyclers that spawn in mobs to assist a boss, etc. and can also be "turned off" via screen secrets, combo triggering, or anything else that can change a combo! The "NPC Script Slot" attribute can lead to interesting effects, such as modifying attributes of the spawned enemy in a way that the current triggered-combo-spawns-enemy system doesn't allow for. I also would like to ask for this to work on the FFC layer and possibly layers 1/2 so it can be layered over other combo types.

-Flags
1. Spawn When No Other Beatable Enemies Exist - if on, this combo can still spawn an enemy when cycled to when the room is otherwise devoid of enemies. If off, then it will not.

Attributes
1. Enemy ID (-9 to 511): The ID of the enemy to spawn. Negative values use the value of whatever enemy is in the screendata's enemy X slot.
2. Amount: Spawns X amount of enemies.
3. NPC Script Slot (0 to 255) - ID of an NPC script slot. This NPC script will be applied to all enemies spawned by this combo.

(0 to 511, enemies have more IDs than items)
(also I immediately don't want to touch this with a 50 foot pole)

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2023 05:15

@ Alucard648 this is what I'm thinking for what you wanted to circumvent the 512-enemy limit, because if you make a combo with the ID attribute set from 0 to -9, it spawns a screen enemy, and you can use the NPC Script Slot of this combo to change how the enemy spawned by it works, effectively giving yourself more than 512 enemies.
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "(0 to 511, enemies have more…"): Huh? I checked NPC script slots and they're just from 0-255. The NPCs THEMSELVES are 0-511

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:15

or, oh
yep
didn't read that right
regardless, here's your immediate problem
How do you give the script InitD[]
the answer is, you don't
so this would only work for scripts that require 0 arguments
(combos *do not have enough attributes* to cover InitD)
and the second problem is this sounds like at least a week of ripping my hair out
sooo, unless @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) is interested
probably not happening, at least any time soon

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2023 05:17

Are triggered combos spawning NPCs fucked up?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:17

The idea of "On trigger, spawn 1 NPC"
means "In the code block for combo trigger, add 2 lines spawning an NPC"
This, needs some way of being checked every frame for the timer
running in a main loop somewhere
keeping track of enemies on screen to see if it needs to stop spawning
somehow keeping track of where it is in its' current timer
which would require creating some sort of new timer for every combo pos on the screen for this to use

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2023 05:18

yeah okay we can expunge the timer thing. I'd only ever use it to spawn one enemy per combo cycle, the "spawn every frame" idea was solely for power users

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:18

and it would need to keep track of how many it has spawned, similarly
To have it be "spawn one enemy when this combo appears" would be easy!
....and also take 2 seconds to set up using triggers
Auto triggered, spawn enemy, done.
or well
and next->1
the script slot being the only thing then
but again that wouldn't be able to get InitD anyway
(If you really need to spawn 'new types of enemies' with custom InitD.... scripts are the far better option?)
(Cuz like, you can just spawn an enemy, and then edit its' script and InitD and graphics and w/e else)

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2023 05:21

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Auto triggered, spawn enemy,…"): like I said in the intro, I think that's a little byzantine for new users and will cause them to overlook it
also fair enough, that idea of mine was a little wacky

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:21

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "like I said in the intro, I t…"): the response to this is 'too bad'
Should I make a new way to do palette cycling because the current one is too complicated
or a new form of... literally name anything complicated
something just being complicated for new users doesn't mean an easier method is feasible/worthwhile
and here, setting 3 values in a combo is pretty much as simple as it gets

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2023 05:22

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "To have it be "spawn one enem…"): It depends on how complex it would be to add, and for this you indicated it would be easy to add

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:23

aye, but that's feasibility, not worthwhileness- only one half of the condition
taking up a whole other combo type ID for something that can be configured fancier and better, or damn simply, in any combo with triggers, is not *worthwhile*
Here's the thing
>Set combo type
>Set attribute for enemy
or
>Set auto triggered
>Set enemy ID
>Set Combo Change 1
2 steps vs 3, barely a difference
and for the latter, those are all directly in the same place, the triggers tab
but then
>Set auto triggered
>Set enemy ID
>Set Combo Change 1
>Set proximity requirement: 24
boom, now it only spawns when you get close!
>Set sword
>Set enemy ID
>Set Combo Change 1
enemy under a bush!
(could make it Bush type with ComboType Effects checked to have it also do the normal bush cutting)
so, the current system via triggers allows you to configure it so much to exactly what you need
....if I were to just add that simple combo type
that means feature requests will start coming in to add this, that, and the other thing to that combo type
and people won't *look* for the other ways to do it that already have those customizations
so, feasible yes, worthwhile no

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2023 05:26

yeah, that is thoughtful. maybe I need to add some "auto-spawning" enemy/item drop combos in the future default tileset to make it clear that it's possible via the triggers tab

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:27

^ That's the right approach
It'll especially matter once we get to time for the "new default tileset" shit
which has been planned to be a contest
In which case, a list of features that should be included in the tileset pre-set-up would want to include things like this
....that contest isn't particularly close at hand, though
(probably late *beta*)

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2023 05:28

yeah, i only mention it because it's what is supposed to introduce people to a 2.55 feature-complete set

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:28

aye
I'm gonna just close this then

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2023 05:29

mm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:29

but yeah, setting things up as examples is the way to show new people how to do it
not creating alternative simpler ways to do it with less customizability
Kinda the main reason I came up with the triggers stuff
(I mean, Zoria came up with the initial system of triggering things with weapons, but, it had no generic *effects*- those were mine)
the point being, you can combine any and all of those features at once in a single combo
you *can't* combine multiple *combo types* in a single combo, no matter how hard you try
So, realistically, the way I look at it is:
`Does this need enough customizability that it needs attributes`
`Does this possibly have issues if mixed with other combo types`
Ex. the `Shooter` combo
Spawn Weapon wouldn't work as a trigger, because you need to set too much about it; the damage, type, gfx, dir, etc
enemies/items, all that is in the enemy/item editors
