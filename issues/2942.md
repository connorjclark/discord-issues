hahaha, the buttons are offset
hitting cancel will save it I think?
because... yep, the numbers are just off by a couple
easy fix

=== @ Phosphor 12/31/2023 01:21

That allowed me to set the screen but it never saves the dmap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/31/2023 01:22

oh? interesting

=== @ Phosphor 12/31/2023 01:22

it's always dmap 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/31/2023 01:22

oh yep
because the index

=== @ Phosphor 12/31/2023 01:22

You can see in the video that every time I open the window it defaults back to map 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/31/2023 01:22

for the dmap
is ALSO
offset
haha
great
ok, it'll be fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/31/2023 01:32

tested, confirmed fixed, and pushed.
