It seems to cap out at 244 rupees maximum for some reason

F.e. if you adjust the price of the item of the first shop in a quest:
```shopdata shop = Game->LoadShopData(0);
    shop->Price[0] = 500;```
It caps at 244

Tested in the latest nightly, but this problem already existed in alpha 113

....
it's not capping properly, it's instead doing a weird byte casting thing
...and it should be word not byte
what the fuck zoria
(easy fix)

...also info shop prices were writing to normal shop prices, not info shop prices
great coding

Hahaha
Zoria classic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 13:01

but yeah
it was capped at 255
except it wasn't BOUNDING, it was CASTING
so 256 would be 0, 257 would be 1, etc
complete nonsense

What the f
Well then

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/27/2023 13:09

Anyway I wrote a nice script (for some other user, I don't even use the classic shops) that removes previously bought items

I also noticed while making that there was some other oddity about the shopdata. But perhaps this behaviour is intentional: when you set item 0 to "not sold" by doing `->HasItem[0] = false` it doesn't sell any items at all. It seems it just won't register any subsequent items then

I was able to solve it with code though, but it seems like odd behaviour to me

yeah, uh, that's fun.
NES room types have some fun jank
If you actually were to edit a shop in ZQ and leave the first item blank, you'll note that as soon as you hit OK, it's actually then the last item that is blank
it forces empties to the end

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/27/2023 13:38

Ah OK
Well I wouldn't bother messing around with it if I were you, I was able to solve it with ZScript anyway (by just rebuilding/shifting the shop items)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 13:39

yeah, simple enough
