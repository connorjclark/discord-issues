Emily told me to post this, but basically this bug is due to FFCs seemingly not accepting decimal values. @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) can explain this a bit better than I can.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 03:53

yeah uh, x/y pos and vx/vy etc are just not saving decimal values

Fun

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/08/2023 10:15

any clue what would cause this?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/08/2023 11:24

```class set_ffc_command : public user_input_command
{
public:
    struct data_t {
        zfix x, y, vx, vy, ax, ay;``` I think I fixed it by changing the x/y/vx/vy/ax/ay in whatever this is (I think it's the undo FFC stuff Connor added?) from int to zfix
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) would this screw anything up?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/08/2023 11:40

it seems to work in zquest but I can't check in ZC because it's not letting me test quest; getting a "header doesn't match" error, which isn't right...

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) would t…"): nope

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 17:26

Does just the velocity need zfix or do x,y too? Can't recall if you can actually edit x, y in the form or only dragging (which gets snapped to the grid anyhow)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 17:27

Whatever change you make, the order needs to remain the same.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/08/2023 17:28

x and y can be decimal

Ringing some bells - similar to https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1085431920185323530 ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/08/2023 20:28

Not in the dialog though, you could edit them fine in the dialog it just rounded when saving

The fix should be in the latest nightly. Marking as fixed
