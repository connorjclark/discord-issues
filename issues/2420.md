I have some ladder only combos and Link cannot walk south across them.  This is QR string: `##FB63E77FC11B81A0AFA6CB7B9BA7A4DFDE2804230648E400FC1B447E0867F1D01E430004709FF801129E184400000000000040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000BE80E400080000000000000000000000000000##`

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) any chance you can take a look at this my brain has no ability to handle ladder bullshit right now
(This is definitely my shit, it's `Newer Player Movement` QR....)

I should update this to let you both know that rightward is not working as well.

I really don't trust myself to fix this
pretty sure it's in `HeroClass::scr_walkflag`, just, not sure what to do
