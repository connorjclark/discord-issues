So in builds past 28th of June, scripts break when recompiled in those versions. It compiles without errors, but in-game the scripts do not work. 
Examples: Newbie Boss crashes the game just straight up.
Newbie Item freezes for a second when creating the item, and things like projectile sprite rotation doesn't work at all.

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) not ruling out a5 being the cause but this is more likely related to recent zasm opts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/08/2022 21:57

@ Russ (adding to thread)
Is there any error output to the console if it's open?

=== @ Russ 07/08/2022 21:57

Not that I could see. Let me turn on expanded logging though
No script errors printed at least

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/08/2022 21:58

can I have a quest file with an easily reproducable crash?
(I haven't had this happen in any of my recent test quests, so, it isn't just EVERYTHING being broken, it must be something specific)

=== @ Russ 07/08/2022 21:59

Nope. Nothing prints
Sure thing. Give me a bit to get something together

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/08/2022 22:00

thankfully, hard crashes are usually not that hard to track down, because debug mode in MSVC can show exactly where the crash line is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/08/2022 22:01

the thing that confuses me here
is there's only one commit that is likely to be the cause in the timeframe listed
....but, nothing IN that commit looks even remotely suspicious
unless you were calling one of a very small set of functions that *were not documented anywhere* so you wouldn't know they existed to call, but, if you were, that should fail *compile*, not *run*

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/08/2022 22:28

would it be worth posting the lone of code in question

=== @ Russ 07/08/2022 22:33

The lone bit of code is an absolutely massive custom subscreen integrated with a whole bunch of global systems, so probably not the easiest thing to do

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/08/2022 22:53

I was referring to the line of code Emily was saying that the debugger stops at
üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/08/2022 22:54

I would need a quest file to run to test that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 01:24

(replying to @ Russ "Sure thing. Give me a bit to‚Ä¶"): [3.5 Hours Later]

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 01:49

~6pm to ~9:30pm is 3.5 hours

=== @ Russ 07/09/2022 01:56

Sorry, sorry
Am working on the official release for the quest this bug is in

=== @ P-Tux7 07/09/2022 02:04

oh sorry
Also just saying... something more important than ZC could have unexpectedly happened

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:05

I mean yeah, no rush
it's just a matter of `without a test quest to debug I can't start fixing this`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:28

OK, so
Looking through the quest in question
Not a single thing appears related to any of the opcodes altered in this commit: (https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/commit/2da2521062cbd0f9630ebf6d1125d9e232561ff6)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:30

So, more likely to be the commits around June 24th?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 03:31

What we need is a quest file and an exact screen that runs a script you say causes the game to crash
Until then it just takes too long for us to figure out what you're seeing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:32

I have a test quest that causes the crash
though it isn't fast to do so

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 03:32

ooo

That's where the debugger broke
which uhh
doesn't exactly help much
Not a single error printout in the console

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 03:33

Why no sources?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:34

Great question

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 03:34

Is that normal for you? In debug mode and on main thread I'd expect a stack trace etc
Weird

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:34

I would expect it to give me an exact line of code
Usually if I get disassembly, it crashed in some `std::` thing
or, well, some *obscure* thing
Usually like, an `std::vector`, I still get normal code

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 03:35

What does the stack trace panel say
Bottom right ish

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:35

(that was taken a while ago)
(gonna need to re-run it)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:37

UHHH

Completely different crash now
this time on loading the quest

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/994526638853341194/995171894145847306/unknown.png?ex=65ebd98c&is=65d9648c&hm=4d0b336d3f2fb77965431233f8d77df6e48579ccb907cd50b9eecd237575d141&)

FUCK ME

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:40

Oh, that isn't even pure new code
it's a line that was copy-pasted from another spot
so, how the fuck is it not crashing in the other spot????
Oh
Because I am fucking STUPID


=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:46

Ahk
THAT is fixed now
and the other error..... appears to be in a related area
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
```cpp
void CScriptDrawingCommands::push_commands(CScriptDrawingCommands* other, bool del)
{
    commands.insert(commands.end(), other->commands.begin(), other->commands.end());
    count += other->count;
    if(del) delete other;
}```
It's crashing on the `insert`
`other->commands` is length `7`
`commands` is capacity `0`
......and it starts lagging as it approaches this crash.
So, uh, I'm definitely feeling like there's a memory leak happening here
and it's running out of memory and crashing
....oh
the fucking
destructor
for that class
is empty
oh, but it's data is stored in other structs in it
which DO have destructors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:50

AHA, that one is missing a destructor
and it has a fucking whole bitmap pointer

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "AHA, that one is missing a de‚Ä¶"): ....and fixing that didn't fix the issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:59

Ahk
that's it for tonight
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/commit/ce8f29d99e8cd5f3f0daecf8afffb7e312371d28
This is the faulty commit, as far as I can see @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
hopefully you can take a crack at it to see what's wrong
The entire set of classes in `script_drawing.h` used to only ever be created once, so memory leaks weren't noticable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:02

Pushed the 2 small fixes I found
no clue what else here is broken, but it is still here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:11

Hmm, I do have an idea for a simple fix though
let's see if it works

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:20

these memsets are wrong.
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/994526638853341194/995182761390387310/unknown.png?ex=65ebe3ab&is=65d96eab&hm=b2d2a7ca1dbadd362c92256a1e2eac6e40c975bc85e0f3fb07cb06ba9fc07183&)
its a std container class can you just do clear?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:21

I copied what was there before
which is what it's done for over a decade
<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:22

ok, it was wrong before. you cant use memset with std vectors
no wonder the memory is sad
it seems like the intention is to clear it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:22

That is the intention

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:22

try calling clear there and see if it stops?
cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:22

though, I would doubt that's the issue
given that that's been like that
for over a decade
and this issue appeared about a week and a half ago

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:23

undefined behavior is a tricky beast

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:23

you see, what I am worried about
is this piece of shit
`void* ptr; //will be changed later`
sitting in `CScriptDrawingCommandVars`
because that's a fucking raw pointer
which could be either to an `std::string` or `std::vector<int32_t>` (or null)
.....which I don't see anything that clears?

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/09/2022 04:24

If you're not in control of your fear you're not in control of the code
- Coolgamers 7/9/2022
Interesting issue though.

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/09/2022 04:26

Is it time to change the code, as the comment says?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:34

Well uhh
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
changing it to use clear
caused it to crash even sooner

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:38

uhg
so
memsetting
does not change the vector's `size`
clearing
does
and by lowering the vector's size
it causes out of bounds errors
fucking everywhere

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:44

try `theVector.assign( theVector.size(), 0 );`
to keep the size
but clear it all
change 0 to the default value of the type tho
hmmm idk if thatd work for value types...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:45

nope
let's see if ```cpp
    auto sz = commands.size();
    commands.resize(0);
    commands.resize(sz);```works

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:47

maybe clear() then reserve(count)?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:47

`reserve` doesn't change size, only capacity

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:47

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:48

and `vector[indx]` is only valid where `indx < size()`, and is invalid where `size() <= indx < capacity()`
`resize()` to 0 and then back up, however, works
at least, it hasn't insta-crashed, and the draws are visible
now to see if it fixed the actual issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 04:50

nope
same crash as previously

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 04:57

damn

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 05:06

OH
So that `void* ptr` that I was concerned about?
Shouldn't have been
it's owned by another object, and passed to the individual command things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 05:11

....k, this is just a mess
and I've now tried enough things that I really need to just not commit any of it and just reset
and I'm too tired to continue tonight
so


=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/10/2022 20:20

I reverted the cause of this, for the record. Didn't mention it here
