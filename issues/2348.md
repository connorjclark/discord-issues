Me and Emily kind of talked about it, and agreed it could be a cool idea. 

So basically, you can only put a "Yes" prompt and a "No" prompt for combos. Works very nice, but it'd be nice if we could play a string when unable to open!

Should be simple enough to just do the signpost "play a string" code when failing to unlock a lockblock.

So, working on this... and just realized the slight fun times.
I went to copy the combo wizard section for the string from the signpost combo wizard.

What about reusable keys? So attempt to take away key/s from such lockblock will result in resetting it`s unlocked state.

(replying to @ Alucard648 "What about reusable keys? So…"): Sounds like an interesting idea for a script
