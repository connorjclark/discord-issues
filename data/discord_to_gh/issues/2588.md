A lot of countries that have more special characters in their languages have the AltGr key and it's needed to get some glyphs. For example: + ? \ are all on the same key on my keyboard. There seems to be no support for altgr input, this is despite it being something that existed and worked in older versions of ZC.

I assume this is related to the allegro updates, but it's frankly weird that it would lose this behaviour.

I guess additional info is that I'm on win7. And the keyboard layout I have in particular is Swedish qwerty
