Add `Win x86`/`Win x64`/`OSX x64` to the `Etc->About` dialog, and equivalent `ZC->About` dialog

Also, a "Copy version info to clipboard" button would be nice... @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) could you mayhaps get me some code for OS clipboard access? (The use would be a button that copies a specific string of data to the clipboard, not like, letting you copy/paste everywhere)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/25/2022 17:15

That sounds useful
I was thinking it could also dump a bunch of shit at the end of the string like what quest rules are enabled
To reduce some back and forth
So a "copy bug report template " thing

Just being able to have a "copy version info" and "Copy rule info" so you can just post a string would be great

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/25/2022 17:17

With a load rule string part too
To put it into a test quest

al_set_clipboard_text(all_get_display(), "Copied from Allegro!");
should be the code
Am currently On mobile

Ah, seems simple
Also on mobile lol, not home till late
So no rush
And frankly I can probably handle it tomorrow with just that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/25/2022 17:19

You ought to be able to use any allegro 5 API without any hoops btw
There's this all (allegro legacy) "get display" function that gets you the a5 display object but that's the only special thing

bwahahahhaha
