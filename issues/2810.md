can't use bombs unless you have at least 1 bomb counter-wise, even if the bomb's cost in the bomb counter is 0 
even though it displays with the "No Ammo Required to Display Subscreen Item" on, it's not selectable on the subscreen or usable.

hopefully this is as easy to fix as I think

@ Attempt try this? (there is a compat rule to disable, though I also fixed the `Never Disable Ammo On Subscreen` rule, as it should also have been fixing this)

seems to check out, although i don't know if being able to use the bombs while the compat rule is on is intentional or not, but not a big deal either way
but yeah the bug itself seems fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 18:26

can you still use them with the compat rule on AND `Never Disable Ammo on Subscreen` off?
because @ Attempt that would be a problem

=== @ Attempt 11/02/2023 18:27

do you mean the no ammo required rule?

=== @ Attempt 11/02/2023 18:29

because no they disappear with that off and the compat rule on

üëç

=== @ Attempt 11/02/2023 18:34

(i don't see a `Never Disable Ammo on Subscreen` rule specifically, so i'm assuming that's what ya meant)

(replying to @ Attempt "(i don't see a `Never Disable‚Ä¶"): oh, err, yeah, that's the internal name lol

=== @ Attempt 11/02/2023 18:36

ohhh gotcha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 18:36

(replying to @ Attempt "because no they disappear wit‚Ä¶"): they should disappear based on their *proper cost counter* with the compat rule off, and *bombs/sbombs* with the compat rule on

=== @ Attempt 11/02/2023 18:37

yeah they do that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 18:37

üëç great, thanks for the tests!

=== @ Attempt 11/02/2023 18:37

no prob
