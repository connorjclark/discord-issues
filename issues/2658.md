I apologize for the sloppily cropped video but there is an item duplication exploit in ZC. In my case the room has the enemies->items flag and a reset room combo for the pushblock puzzle. This is an embarrassing oversight if I ever saw one.

So basically triggering Reset Room combo also resets "Item" screen state?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/14/2023 11:49

that's intended
reset combos reset everything

=== @ Moosh 09/14/2023 11:49

yeah this is what reset room is intended to do

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/14/2023 11:49

you need to select what things they *don't* reset

=== @ Moosh 09/14/2023 11:50

If you don't want it to do this, check the "No Reset" flags in screen data

yeah lol, this is exactly what reset room combos do by design

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/14/2023 12:34

I see...

=== @ Moosh 09/14/2023 12:35

It's easy to overlook the purpose since it's a bit technical. I used it in LQftH2 for a puzzle without knowing what it actually did
Because it seems like it should be a puzzle reset button, but without the state stuff, you could accomplish the same effect with a warp to the same room
