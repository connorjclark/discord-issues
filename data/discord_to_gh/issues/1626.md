This is an unhinged bug unearthed by doing some frankly irresponsible shit but I do think it's a real bug

If you have a "Bush->Next" FFC on the screen, it reacts to scripted weapons with "lweapon->Weapon = LW_SWORD" and goes to the next combo normally

If you then reset the FFC->Data to the bush combo, it will NOT react to scripted weapons with "lweapon->Weapon = LW_SWORD" but WILL react to a normal sword item
Can provide a test quest if needed

I wanna pop in and add that FFC Bush->Next combos seem to have weird behavior in general, sometimes the dropped items and leaf animations will spawn up to a tile over from where the bush was cut. Can create a separate bug report if needed

also fwiw Tall Grass->Next & Slash->Next combos have the same issue as what mitch described

also tested regular Bush and Flower, same

Same thing with Pound combos too changing the scripted weapon to LW_HAMMER
