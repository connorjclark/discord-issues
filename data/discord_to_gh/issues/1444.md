For the magic mirrors, flags to switch between reflecting one side, the other, or both (no flags, acts as normal, both sides. And combined directions for the spotlight Attribyte[0] (like UD, LR, UL, UR, etc.)

?
Magic mirrors and spotlights don't interact
Or, the combo
Duh

I know, I guess I should've split this into two different requests

Umm
So, for spotlights, you can just layer multiple
With different dir
