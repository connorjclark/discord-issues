I recently finished work on a bunch of the raw bmp. images required for the dev team (mainly Dimi and Emily) to be able to add these fonts to the engine. The zip file in question contains .bmp images for the following fonts: Final Fantasy Six, Gunstar Heroes, E.V.O - Search for Eden, Betrayal at Krondor, Wario Land 4, Super Mario World's credit font, and an update to the Chrono Trigger font to fix it's broken ? mark.

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 07:40

In the case of the Gunstar Heroes font, I had to create new lowercase characters from scratch, hopefully they are satisfactory in appearance.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 13:35

@ FireSeraphim some of these are not properly paletted

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 13:39

-Chrono trigger fixed questionmark
-EVO Search for Eden
-FF6

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 14:03

So, if you can just fix the palettes on these 3

As for the ones you have shown in screenshots, I believe they look good and are ready for primetime
Oh boy, it seems I spoke too soon, the final row of warioland 4 letters needs to be lowered by one pixel. gimme a chance to fix that

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 15:49

hopefully fixed the borked letter offset of the final row of letters

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Ping me when you can, I think I'm up for making perhaps a few more fonts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 15:51

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "These should be fixed"): gunstar heroes was fine, chrono trigger was not

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 15:53

Oops, I thought I sent the right one, hold on!

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 16:24

A new bonus font I made, this font is based on the common font used by Atlus' SNES Shin Megami Tensei titles (Shin Megami Tensei 1 and & 2, Shin Megami Tensai If, Kyūyaku Megami Tensei, and a few others)

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 16:28

As a cheeky little nod to the common currency in the SMT games, I have for the purposes of this font replaced the traditional $ sign with the ¥ sign
if this proves to be a problem, I'll gradly provide a version of the SMT font that has the traditional $ sign

I like it having the yen sign ❤️

I'm glad you like it
I think I got one more, just finished it and I just need to adjust the colour index in it

This is the font used in textboxes in Super Mario World

just got finished making this
I feel like I'm on a roll, perhaps I'll make a few more fonts and send them to you in bulk

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 17:14

Ooh, does it have the coin symbol

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 17:15

Um no? I could quickly whip up a version with the coin symbol if that is really desired

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 17:17

I had to go back to this one real quick to fix a few inaccurate letters, namely the . symbol and the " and ` symbols

then I'll do it, gimme a few seconds

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 22:37

And now for another batch of fonts, from yours truly. To summarized the following fonts:
1. Classic Doom font: this font is based on the ingame pickup message fonts from all four of the classic Doom titles (Ultimate Doom, Doom 2 - Hell on Earth, Final Doom - The Plutonia Experient and Final Doom - TNT Evilution) The uppercase letters were originally created by James "Jimmy" Paddock for the use of doom modders who wanted a version of the ingame text font that had working uppercase letters
2. Disorientation font: this is a custom freely usable font I found on the net that I like to use when I need something written in a very tiny but readable manner, This font has been extraordinary useful to me and I went out of my way to port to the bmp format required for the engine
3. La Mulana MSX font: This font was a pain to create and I had to grab the internal png image from the original classic version of the game and transpose the letters one at a time into a bmp that the ZC engine can use. (My brother request this)
4. Mega Man Classic font: This font is based on the font used in all the eight bit styled classic Mega Man games (MM1, MM2, MM3, MM4, MM5, MM6, MM9 and MM10) and I figured this font would be useful if Peteo ever came back and decided to fully commit to his plan to remake his Dr. Wily's Revenge quest, but it could be used as a nice tech-y font.
5. Pixel Wingdings font: This one is obvious. For the funnies it would be great @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) if when you showed this font off you used the entire text from Dr. Gaster's Log Entry #17
6. Super Mario RPG Dialogue font: This is the font used in menus and textboxes in Super Mario RPG, I figured it would be nice to have.
7.  Super Mario World Textbox font: This is the font used in textboxes in Super Mario World, I have gone ahead and included a second variant with the $ replaced with the coin symbol as request.
8. The Undertale and Deltarune font: This is the one font used in both games, go knock yourselves out!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 22:39

oh god *8* more
wow
I'll, uh, add those *later*
(batches are better than separate, though, so this is good!)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 22:43

`FONT_DOOM`, `FONT_DISORIENT`, `FONT_LAMU_MSX`, `FONT_MEGA_CLASSIC`, `FONT_WINGDING`, `FONT_SMRPG`, `FONT_SMW_TXTBOX`, `FONT_UNDERTALE`

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 22:43

I was about to say "What's the matter, cat got your tongue?"

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 23:06

i think wingdings should be showcased in the typical way, to be fair
since as a font meant to get around adding more actual characters, it is useful to show off all the characters it adds so that when the user changes the font using an SCC, they will be able to use those characters
Oh yeah that reminds me... is the Xenogears font any different from the SMRPG font? They sure look similar hahaha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:08

> changes the font using an SCC
...I don't actually know if there is one for that?

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 23:10

What Xenogears font? I don't recall doing one at all!

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 23:21

i mean like, the dialogue boxes seem to have the same font in smrpg and xenogears

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "> changes the font using an S…"): oh whoops, no
and on second thought, that would be an utter BITCH to program into the previewer

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:24

actually it wouldn't be that bad
The main thing is that it would allow different heights on a line
...but, *drawing tiles* already allows that
so it should be able to be handled
Feature request that?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/30/2023 00:42

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "The main thing is that it wou…"): i thought they also had different widths

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 00:46

Well yeah but that's not the problem
Different characters in the same font can have different widths

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 01:17

(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/31/2023 09:44

and now for a third and potentially final batch of eight new fonts:
1. Earthworm Jim: for this font quite a few upper and lowercase letters were missing so I had to wing it and try to fill in the gaps with custom letters of my own that try to keep the style and spirit of the EWJ font.
2. Castlevania - Dracula X SNES credits font: This one is from the ending credits of the SNES pseudo-port/sequel to Castlevania Rondo of Blood.
3. Gradius 3 AC font: This font is based on the one from the arcade port of Gradius 3 (and it's the menu font I was using in a doom project that's current in hiatus). James "Jimmy" Paddock designed the missing lowercase letters for this font.
4. Pokemon GSC font: This is based on the font from GBC Pokemon titles (Pokemon Gold, Silver and Crystal). I figured quests current attempting to use the few existing pokemon based tilesets could benefit from this font.
5. Actraiser font: A nice little font from Quintet's debut title, Actraiser. I think this font is great in case you're looking for something different from the Z1 NES font.
6. Moredhel runes font, from Betrayal at Krondor: This font appears on Moredhel riddle chests and I think requires one of your three party members from Betrayal at Krondor to cast a translation spell to decipher the Moredhel runes so you can have a chance at solving the riddle on the riddle chests. A nice font incase you need another font to be used with Zoria's Encrypted Signboard script. Really wish someone would recreate Betrayal at Krondor's riddle chests.
7. Betrayal at Krondor Small font: This font is actually used in game for regular dialogue in BAK, the bigger font I submitted earlier is actually used for Chapter titles since BAK is structured into different chapters (kinda like Chrono Trigger and Paper Mario for example)
8. Fallout classic font: This is the ingame font used in Fallout 1 and 2, a great retro-futuristic tech-y font, in case you need one.

the smw coin font you just sent
it might have nothing to do with the crash though
grabber is just an old piece of absolute junk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 19:08

I labelled the WingDings and BAK Runes as "Broken" fonts, meaning they won't be usable for the ZQ GUI- same as the goron/zoran/etc, anything that isn't readable english font.

I'm glad you did that emily

Can we get these fonts supported in the subscreen menu editor, the new fonts I made aren't really showing up there.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/28/2023 15:54

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "Can we get these fonts suppor…"): adding them there is a whole other system

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/29/2023 00:40

I see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/29/2023 00:41

ideally we convert the subscreen to use the main font system, but, that requires touching the subscreen code which is jank af
will take some time before that happens

=== @ FireSeraphim 05/29/2023 01:47

aye

=== @ cbailey78 05/30/2023 12:42

We're gonna leave the subscreen code to Elon Musk.

This is something I've had done for a while but never been able to convert over into a ZC-usable format until now: it's the Zelda 1 Famicom Disk System version's font, minus the Japanese text.

Tested it by filling the custom font slots with appropriately-renamed copies of it, and sure enough, it showed up in most of ZQuest.

I've also had an expansion of it - filling out the entire DOS page 437, so characters 0 through 255 - done on another sheet for a few years, so it was trivial to port into Allegro format using GIMP. I dunno what in the engine would need to be changed to support this kinda thing, but here's that:

(replying to @ 4matsy "I've also had an expansion of…"): I tried to get it to read more characters, and it just was like "nope not gonna that's garbage bye"
(not just now, like, when I was initially doing font stuff)
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ 4matsy 07/01/2023 18:17

Yeah, I figured it wouldn't be as simple as changing the numbers, and that there'd be some hardcoding involved. Oh well. ^\_^;
Thanks for the pin, btw. 🙂

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/01/2023 18:19

I've been pinning all of them until I get around to them
it's not too easy adding new fonts in
but, like, adding 5 at once is not much more difficult than adding 1
so best done in batches

=== @ 4matsy 07/01/2023 18:21

Right.

=== @ FireSeraphim 07/02/2023 20:14

In hindsight I realized that the letters in the doom font are too spaced out, I'm working on a proportional version and I hope to have it done soon

=== @ FireSeraphim 07/02/2023 20:42

and here we go, an update to the doom font with much better letter spacing

This is the font from Kemal "KE-SOFT" Ezcan's (somewhat) (in)famous Mario clone for the Atari 8-bit family of computers, "Bros". There's a couple of YouTube longplays/playthroughs (or at least attempts) of it on there if you search for it - the game is pretty difficult due to janky controls, though, so takes some getting used to (and maybe some emulator savestates) to actually beat.

Because the characters are so thin, I also resized them into this double-wide "faux wide" variant that fills a more familiar 8x8 area once the spacing is accounted for.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/05/2023 00:27

I'm probably not actually going to add any more to the program than are already added now, actually.
That because, it's better to set up allowing quests to have their own fonts, similar to how they have their own midis/sfx, able to be loaded (I can compile all of the ones you send here into a nice default package, still, of course)

=== @ 4matsy 08/05/2023 00:39

That's also a good idea, actually.
Is there already a way to set up allowing quests to have their own fonts in ZQ, or were you talking about adding it as a feature? :o

=== @ P-Tux7 08/05/2023 00:40

OOH
i'm glad you're getting around to that
for whatever reason i assumed it was impossible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/05/2023 00:42

(replying to @ 4matsy "That's also a good idea, actu…"): you can use the `customfonts` folder (with the option checked in zq) to override an existing font with a custom one
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i'm glad you're getting aroun…"): I'm not, yet. It's on the list though.

=== @ PixElvis02 08/20/2023 01:11

Hey Emily, by any chance is there like a tutorial video about how to import our own fonts in ZQ for ZC or something? I tried following the steps on the notepad but I think I'm not doing it right or it doesn't work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2023 01:11

nope
Firstly, there's no way to use them in ZC
they are only customizable for the GUI in ZQ
(adding custom fonts for zc might happen at some point, but, not yet)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2023 01:13

Secondly, you need this checked

(in `Etc->Options`)

=== @ PixElvis02 08/20/2023 01:14

I did that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2023 01:14

and thirdly you place fonts in the `customfonts` folder with the EXACT filenames it specifies
the fonts should match the style of the ones in the `examplefonts` folder

=== @ PixElvis02 08/20/2023 01:14

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and thirdly you place fonts i…"): I think this is the part that I'm lost

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2023 01:15

do you have font bitmap files that match the ones in the `examplefonts` folder?

=== @ PixElvis02 08/20/2023 01:16

Maybe, I tried one of them but did not match when applying in ZQ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2023 01:17

you may need to make sure it has the correct indexed palette... though I'm PRETTY sure if you just match the 3 colors it uses exactly it should autodetect it

=== @ PixElvis02 08/20/2023 01:19

I'll try that, probably that was the issue

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/08/2023 23:46

can this just be a channel at this point
