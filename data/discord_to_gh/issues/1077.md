Similar to Secrets, you should be able to collect any dropped/left items before timed warping.  I hope this would not be too hard to implement, even if it isn't a high priority list.  Basically after you pick up the last item (or it disappears) the timer starts

Aye, creating a thread leaves a message in the base channel linking to it
So anyone will get *1* notification that a new thread exists, but won't get any notifications for messages in the thread unless they join it or are pinged
