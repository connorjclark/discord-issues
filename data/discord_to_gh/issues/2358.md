A setting for how boots (the ones called Boots) affect step speed. (New Hero Movement only)

This would go with using a Note item to gain and lose Boots items, to mimic the Iron Boots in OOT, and of course the "Is Heavy" Boots flag.

...should Boots be renamed to Step/Terrain Boots or something?
This also has the fortunate effect of Boots being able to increase base speed.
