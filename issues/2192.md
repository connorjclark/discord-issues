What it says on the tin, secrets are triggered once for the current screen. All knock-on effects such as Secrets -> Shutters, Secrets -> Item, and Screen State Carryovers are done too

=== @ P-Tux7 02/24/2023 06:05

Might be worth it to add in the screen's Stairs to this cheat too? (Push -> Stairs and Whistle -> Stairs)

=== @ Moosh 02/24/2023 06:10

Could've sworn this was already a thing but I must've been thinking of toggle light

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/24/2023 06:13

So did I! But it was only a thing in my attempted remake of ZC 🙃

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 02/24/2023 14:23

I'm honestly shocked this isn't a cheat at the moment.  It'd certainly be useful.
Like, I don't want to have to complete an entire block puzzle to test if the block puzzle properly triggers secrets, or to see what those triggered secrets actually look like.
... though I suppose that's more of a ZQuest "X" Preview mode thing.  Assuming it was flawless.

Frankly, hotkeys become a thing to question... I feel like adding a setup for configurable cheat hotkeys would be nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2023 22:32

which would also allow us to add a bunch more, and let the user configure them how they like
....connor re-did cheat stuff with replays, so, I'm pretty sure that's a lot cleaner than it used to be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 03:50

bwhahahahaha

(planning on adding `?` buttons too)

Incredible. Has this changed how cheat mods work at all? Like we don't have to set an alternate key per cheat right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 03:55

cheat mods are as they have been, no difference

=== @ Moosh 02/25/2023 03:55

Nice
hyped to unbind q and a and never have to deal with that issue again though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 03:57

haha, exactly
for testing I changed `w` to *both* `j` and `End`
and that worked fine
(heal life and restore magic both had 2 keys, so it was easiest to just allow any cheat 2 options)
Also, if you set an Alt key, but not a Main key, it will automatically change it from an alt to a main when you hit OK
Notably, this is a new GUI system gui
...which the other control binding ones are not.
So, new shit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 04:01

A lot of this was really easier than I expected though
thanks @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) for your work with cheats you did for replay stuff
made it so much cleaner to do this overhaul

=== @ P-Tux7 02/25/2023 04:28

Oh uh... good catch on the clock thing because it doesn't actually freeze enemies, does it

=== @ P-Tux7 02/25/2023 04:29

Anyways, thanks for adding this

woo, all done
Trigger Secrets exists both temp and perm, defaults with temp trigger bound to the `s` key
of course, now completely rebindable
(Both req cheat lvl 4)

=== @ P-Tux7 02/25/2023 06:34

temp and perm? i thought each screen only had one of the two

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 06:35

. . .
think about that question again
and then think about the difference between a temp and perm step trigger
and what that might mean for a temp and perm cheat

=== @ P-Tux7 02/25/2023 06:36

oh right, those

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 06:36

the temp cheat.... triggers secrets, and they revert when you leave
the perm cheat... triggers secrets and sets the ST_SECRET state so they stay triggered
simple

=== @ P-Tux7 02/25/2023 06:37

i thought temp step triggers just triggered the secret-flagged combos but it wasn't actually, like, a secret in game terms, similar to how step->next combos aren't secrets
i suppose because the secret sound never plays on either

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/25/2023 06:40

no, they are secrets, and they trigger everything about secrets
they literally just don't set the secret state

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/04/2023 05:26

oh, err, this is closed
