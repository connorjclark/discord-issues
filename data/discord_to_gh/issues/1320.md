Down and Up are incorrect
They should be swapped

Oh, is this for #1317 ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/04/2022 15:40

Not even remotely related

=== @ P-Tux7 01/04/2022 15:42

Oh, sorry. I saw the EWeapon stuff

=== @ P-Tux7 01/04/2022 15:43

I hope you can get to those soon please - it's the only thing preventing me sending a demo to James24.

Also AdjacentCombo fails on screen edges. Here is the fixed function.

Fixed the LinkFacing issue
@ Alucard648 I might be editing that function you sent a little if that's okay

(mostly to remove an unnecessary array index and to include DirNormal into the function)
(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìstd_extension
