=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:03

I'm running into a curious phenomenon where the last 4 frames of my custom animation for the MISC:Death sprite is simply not playing. I partly suspect it has something to do with how that animation is handled by default. I have the number of frames set to nine and the animation speed set to six. The animation speed variable doesn't seem affect MISC:Death.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:05

As a test, I recommend starting a fresh quest file and then importing and setting this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/598566141992108032/891132421884506122/16x16_IOG_Death_Animation.png as the MISC:Death animation (since that's what I was using) with the same numbers I was using.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:14

I went ahead and make a quick pair of gifs to illustrate what's actually happening in comparison to what should be happening

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:15

This is how it looks in game due to the bug in question

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:16

This is how it should look. The animation and spritework is meant to resemble the enemy death animation from Illusion of Gaia

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/25/2021 16:45

@<role: Developer> Sorry to pester you guys, but I figure a bug like this wouldn't be too difficult to fix

=== @ P-Tux7 09/26/2021 01:43

while we're at it, can you check the poof spawn animation as well?
and the "blocked" effect (boomerang on edge of screen or shooting an arrow at a darknut)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 04:31

The `iwDeath` sprite only reads the tile, nothing else. So the frame count/speed is hard-coded.
to fix this without giving enemies custom death sprites per-enemy would be stupid... so this'll be fixed whenever the energy to add that is found

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 03:58

so
firstly

this won't fix the frames, but lets you pick what sprite you want

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 04:10

Thank you. I take it that it will be tonight's nightly build?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 04:11

still working on fixing the frames part

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 04:11

I see...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:09

@ FireSeraphim if you wouldn't mind testing this out

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:09

Honestly I'm not a coder by any means.

not necessarily the script part
There's a QR under `Backwards compat -> 3` for changing the hardcoded frames
and the enemy editor `Graphics->Sprites` tab for changing the sprites on enemies without scriptsw

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:11

I'll test the QR thing. I'm not interested in driving myself mad by trying to manually set each enemy's death sprite to a new one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:12

as long as it fixes the issue you reported

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:21

I'm testing it now. I'll let you how it pans out on that front

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:22

The ability to switch the sprite was the easy part, so frankly I don't expect issues with that at all
but the animation frames stuff is janky AF
thankfully if it works in once place it should work in all since it's the same code

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:23

It works on my end. Now I just need to tweak the death animation to not play so fast

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:23

woo
it played fast, that's a good sign
guessing the speed was 0?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:24

I had the speed on six for a nine frame animation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:24

ah, you had edited it
that's about half a second for the whole anim
...given, the engine one only ran for 18 frames
if I read this right anyway
I'll leave this open marked sick for a bit in case any issues come up with it
(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìcustom MISC Death animation not playing all the way through

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:28

Not quite there yet...
Now I can't help but to wonder if I'm doing it wrong on my end.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:29

oh?
What's your setup

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:29

9 frames, speed of 12 (and the animation still seems to play too fast from what I'm seeing)
(replying to @ FireSeraphim "As a test, I recommend starti‚Ä¶"): These are the sprites I'm using

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:30

this is unchecked?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:30

Yep

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:33

Is a lower number the way to go for a slower animation? Just now tried it with the frame speed set to 16 as a brute force measure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:33

lower is faster
I noticed something wrong
one moment

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892283008122499072/zelda.exe?ex=65e6aece&is=65d439ce&hm=aab6b981cb72aedc76a08646bba58196f29be70934161ea6873899db85411e7d&
try that
(I thought the sprite anim clock was counting up.... turns out it was counting *down*, so something was set up backwards... oops)

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 05:39

Nope. Just now set the animation frame speed to eight and it's still playing too fast

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:39

Really?
oh wait
fuck
I'm stupid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 05:54

...wtf
....not gonna get this done tonight.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:16

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I did some further testing
It only seems to affect my quest
Link seems to appear just fine in other quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:18

...load an older backup of your quest?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:18

I am temporarily re-enabling the QR for backwards compatibility
just to see if it fixes that anomalous behavior
and then I'll load an older copy of my project afterwards as a futher test

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:23

loaded and tested the copy I sent you at 'round midnight and the same phantom elf problem persists

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:24

Did the QR fix it?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:24

Nope
I did some futher tentative experiementation and link and the enemy and item sprites are invisible. I can seemingly still move the invisible elf into new screens and all
the items aren't invisible in the subscreens.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:27

enemy shadows are still visible as well as other particle effects (have not tried giving myself a magic or fire boomerang yet)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:28

How about `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing`, under `backwards compat -> 2`

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:29

Trying that now.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:30

That seems to have fixed the invisible elf problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:31

that helps narrow it down

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:31

Now I am going to do yet another test and re-disable the new QR you added for death animation as a experiement

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:32

The funny thing is, the same new code runs regardless of the state of the old drawing QR
so a new issue shouldn't be caused by that
let me rebuild from clean

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:37


https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892298998487064637/buildpack.zip?ex=65e6bdb3&is=65d448b3&hm=bcee922679601c74d63ff0dd9e3f4df577834fb187db8cfc9cd169de1c6f6f1a&
@ FireSeraphim try this, either will fix everything or change nothing

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:38

Alright.
I'll let you know how it goes

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:43

It seems to play alright so far, other than the `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing` rule still being enabled. The new death animation QR is still disabled but I'm noticing an old thing where the death animation doesn't play all the way through on certain enemies (zols and bats) and the death animation is still too fast despite me setting it to a frames speed of 16.
I am going to disable the `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing` rule real quick and see how that pans out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:44

if the death compat qr is checked, the animations will be locked in speed and frames
also I just noticed another issue

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:44

that QR is currently not checked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:44

fun

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 06:45

disabled `Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing` just now and the elf and friends are once again invisible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 06:52

ok, try this one now.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891354181447856138/892302947810148392/buildpack.zip?ex=65e6c160&is=65d44c60&hm=f8f03f27bbfed99837293f8b5d098f2b16d828811ab610f06f5f2229a1943e0a&

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:06

Elf and friends are no longer invisible. You're making steps in the right direction, but custom death animations are still borked, in that it doesn't play all the way through and on some enemies it starts on a different frame (bats and gels come to mind as an example)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:07

send allegro.log

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:07

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:08

hmm, that only has zq logs
run it in zc again, make sure to watch a death animation
then send allegro.log

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:09

I just now enabled log game events and log script errors to allegro.log in my quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:09

shouldn't matter
I added debug logs
which don't care about the rules
should also show in the console if you have that open

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:11

I don't have that opened

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:11

it'll also show in allegro.log, so

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:15

I currently have the misc-death animation at a framespeed of 16 if that helps. I haven't changed that since last time

huh, not seeing anything in the log
Go to `ZC->Show ZScript Debugger`

I suspect the text near the bottom would be of interest to you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:22

nope, nothing there useful
the debugger being on won't change allegro.log
it will let you see the information printouts as it happens
which should be whenever something is doing a death animation

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:24

I don't know what you're looking for. I'm killing enemies and getting stuff like DeathAnim: (3/16), fr (5/9)
the fr 2/9 is coming from me killing keese

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:25

It should be printing once per frame of the animation
so the first is saying `(3/16) speed`
and `frame (5/9)`
for a 9-frame 16-speed sprite

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:26

fr 0/9 from killing gels (the little slimes)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:26

it should be making multiple prints per enemy
Technically, if it were working right, it should print `9*16` times per enemy

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:26

it is, but the fr numbers is remaining the same per enemy killed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:27

that... isn't right

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:27

just not got multiple fr 2/9 from killing a keese once

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:28

you should get the same fr value 16 frames in a row

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:29

I don't know what to tell you because I don't know what you're looking for.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:29

hopefully for those values to appear in allegro.log
because everything in the console should appear in the log

the death animation seems to be working for the most part. There's just a minor curious hiccup where near the end of the animation it repeats the first frame, it's appropriately slow at a speed of 16 so I'm going to dial that back down to 8 and see how that looks

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:53

oh boy. dialed it down to eight and the zol (little gels) are still playing the animation really slow.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:54

ditto for the octorocks playing the death animation slow despite me dialing the animation speed back down to eight (the keese seem to respect the animation speed variable and plays it at the expected 8 speed)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:55

it should be all or nothing

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 07:56

peahats seem to respect the 8 anim. speed
black and red moblins play the animation slow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 07:58

they should play it the same if it's set to the same sprite

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:05

I checked. They are set to the same sprite

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:07

see if this fixes anything

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:12

gels, octorock and moblins are still playing the animation slow. Other than that you have seemed to fix the hiccup I mentioned previously

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:14

in my test quest octoroks play it fine

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:15

What I just sent you my quest again via dm? I suspect that might be more productive

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:15

sure
With 9 frames 8 speed, that should be 72 frames, just over a second

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:22

@ FireSeraphim it seems to be working fine in your quest

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:23

Wha?
that's not what I'm seeing on my end

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:23

are you loading a fresh save file?
or one that was saved before?
....given, I don't think that should matter, but that's always the first thing I check

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:25

just now started and tested a fresh save file
still having the slow anim. from gels

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:25

Zoras and Octoroks appear to be animating properly
I frame-counted with frame-advance
the full anim is 72 frames long
which is a bit slow
but that's how you have it set up

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:27

have you killed a keese yet?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:27

oh
I just killed a tektite
so, uh
the slow animation is not the problem
that's correct
the fast one is the problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:31

oh
oh wait you motherfucker
. . . so, enemies that are in the air are drawn multiple times per frame. Which uh. Fuck.
Need to move where this logic is done

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 08:47

well at least it's two steps forward and one step back, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 08:56

so, the invisibility seems to like coming back constantly on me
but goes away when I build from clean
....fun annoyances that make it take much longer to compile, yay
<a:hugheart:884673091878391828>
hopefully this will be done soon

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 09:55

fucking hell
that was an hour solid of trying to get sprites to stop being invisible
I hate everything
I think I fixed everything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 10:03

@ FireSeraphim let me know if this works when you get the chance

=== @ P-Tux7 09/28/2021 16:05

thanks a ton
(replying to @ FireSeraphim "the death animation seems to‚Ä¶"): this is how all animations work iirc with the looping
so putting a duplicate frame at the end can pretty much fix the appearance of it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 16:22

I fixed that issue

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 18:17

Sorry about that guys, I was honesty up past what I should have been
I'm in the Central Time Zone and our discussion (for me at least) was past midnight.
I'll promptly let you know how it both pans out

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 18:40

I can confirm that the animation bug is fixed on my end. With one caveat: now the octorock, gels, keese and moblins are missing their death sound while the aquamentus and dodongos aren't.
Just one last little problem

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 19:17

I'll be back in an hour or two

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/28/2021 21:32

I'm back.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/29/2021 00:58

Hey @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)
Ping me or DM me when you're ready

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/29/2021 02:01

I kinda want to see this last little hurdle dealt with.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 02:18

I'll get to it when I can

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 02:49

@ FireSeraphim see if this fixes the death sounds

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/29/2021 03:24

I can confirm it is fixed.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/29/2021 06:04

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Hello?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 06:05

hi

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/29/2021 06:14

As I just said I can confirm it is fixed. I tested the new build you sent me and it the problem is finally fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2021 06:20

Good
