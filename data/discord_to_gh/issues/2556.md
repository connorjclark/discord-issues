Switching on a string (literal or variable) gives a bunch of errors.

@ Orithan @ Moosh
(Does not occur in random old nightly I grabbed, so this is a new bug, likely related to the other recent parser issues)

=== @ Orithan 07/29/2023 17:09

Thanks
Was in the process of making a bug report myself

=== @ Orithan 07/29/2023 17:24

When did these parser issues start cropping up?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 17:26

around when I added `@InitScript` <:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>
so, july 15th
(there were multiple parser-related changes at once there)
. . . .
. . . . . . . . . . and thank you for making me go over this in my head
because one of those... was related to trace?
. . . but no, that would only affect trace, not traces or printf or anything else
so probably not that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 17:36

...I really don't understand how anything related to the initscript stuff could affect this....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 17:41

AH
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T
This still occurs in `nightly-2023-07-14` which was before those changes
so this is older than that
but not as old as string switches

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 17:45

works in `05-22 (2)`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 17:47

and NOT `05-27`

seems sussy
(...there thankfully really aren't that many parser changes to check lol)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 17:50

. . . hmmmmmm

ok that's easy to spot in the zasm
the `-` lines are initializing the array literal
the `+` lines are DEALLOCATING the array literal
and the `=` lines are USING the array literal
. . . . the order should be `- = +` not `- + =`.
now, WHY is the order wrong?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 17:59

...because this should be `visit` not `literalVisit`, that's gotta fix it lol

Fixed!
Should just be able to add this to latest nightly? @ Orithan

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 18:06

. . . now for the fun question, how many other places suffer from basically this exact issue?
(I changed how `literalVisit` works entirely to fix several nasty bugs that have been around since it existed, which, it was the fix for several nasty bugs with string literals, since they existed, which was 2.54..... this is just a chain of bugfixes fixing the previous bugfixes lmao)
importantly here, it used to only related to initializer code, not deallocation code
which made its' use here just fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 18:10

...hmm, though actually, the init code is now a bit earlier than it should be here, isn't it? . . . I don't think in any way that causes problems, but it could be better.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 18:21

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...hmm, though actually, the…"): And that's fixed now too, was easy enough.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 18:37

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Should just be able to add th…"): updated

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 18:39

also @ Moosh, fun times, look at the commit I just made for this. It was a super easy fix, and I *added macros* to make it easier to fix this particular type of issue in the future. (These issues may well crop up in other places, so good to know how to handle them)

=== @ Orithan 07/30/2023 01:10

Okay that fixes it
