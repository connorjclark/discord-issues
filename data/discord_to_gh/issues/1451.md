Can we PLEASE get a way to copy and paste the current palette of an in-ZQ screen to another screen? 😂

This already exists

WHATTTT
Epic
Thank you
Although I feel it could be done a bit faster

You can put `Paste Palette` as a favorite command @ Jared
Then you just press C to copy a screen, and click the favorite command button to paste the palette
