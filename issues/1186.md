> if you use a bottle'd item in the room, it'll empty your bottle without getting used and give you rupees

> of course it shouldn't just give rupees, it should give an arbitrary counter

> Emily — Today at 5:41 PM
> counter fill (% checkbox) + item
> can set counter to none or item to none to use just one or the other
> good ideas

screen secrets and z1 potion implementation would also be good for "give me a potion" npcs
though as i said in the other thread it can be a script

how many room types do we have left?

@ P-Tux7 to answer your question from the other thread: Majoras Mask
Though there was NPC in OoT that also bought bottle contents

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "how many room types do we hav…"): err.. left?
every expansion costs more memory, as none is "already reserved"
but, theoretically, several hundred thousand

dgh mm
i was gonna feature suggest a life or money but without the life option room type when i got on my computer but now i'm not so sure

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 23:11

that feels like a very obvious thing
as does a pay heart containers

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:14

so each room type only has 1 catch-all value right?
door repair fee, life or money rupee cost, info type, shop type...
