From my understanding bridge combos are supposed to unset solidity bits for all layers under them. And to have a bridge cover half a combo, you can use the effect squares to mark which bits it overrides. But I'm only managing to get a bridge that overrides the full tile

Here's what my combo setup looks like. The idea is the left side should have bridge behavior while the right side should be a barrier
Ah really? Shoot. Swore they did

I gotta say this feature is excellent. I threw together a basic over/under script in a little under an hour when before this was a major multi day headache. Of course the "simple" part might be a part of this, it doesn't interact with enemies

=== @ P-Tux7 10/25/2021 16:36

How'd this help you do that?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/25/2021 19:42

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "How'd this help you do that?"): I imagine the fact that you don't need to make walkable versions of every combo and manually change swap between them for the combos on the under part

lmfao nice

I am deebly sorry Deedee üò¶

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/15/2022 10:31

It's something that needs to be done
but oof I hate my past self

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2022 13:02

I got through the second biggest file of this, which was 30-something calls just to ensure the misalignment things worked with bridges
and 3 of the files didn't need to be changed, so only 2 more files, or about 70 calls left to fix
and then pray that I didn't break them entirely

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2022 13:41

Finished one of them
One file left
aka 31 more calls to look at

=== @ P-Tux7 01/17/2022 16:29

oof

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2022 20:05

Alright, done
I tested it with spikes, water, and solidity
There's a possibility I missed something obscure though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2022 20:26

@ Moosh should be available whenever a new build comes out

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2022 20:28

It'll be tied to a compat rule, "old bridge combo behavior"
