it's very fucking confused about how to draw the title screen
and uhhh
nothing to do with the title screen drawing has changed in *almost 2 years*
so, what the fuck has decided to cause this now, is a great question
it's pulling the tiles from the most recently loaded quest, instead of from the qst.dat quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 11:11

.......so, this change appears to be an issue with the new `qst.dat`
going back a number of builds the issue persisted
but reverting to the old *module* fixed the issue
what the ever-living fuck could cause this
this has probably been broken for *years* on the engine side, just waiting for a module to fuck everything up
and, nothing related to the title screen settings in the module has changed in any way.....
Proposed fix: Revert the title screen to not use modules anymore. This means scavenging for the old code from *years* ago
FML
not tonight's job
@ Moosh @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) figure you might care to be in this thread

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 11:15

Kinda hilarious that modules went relatively unused for so long that something like this apparently slipped by

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 11:15

again, *nothing related to the title screen changed*
even in the module update
so, I still have absolutely no clue what's causing it
also, the fact that it's reading tiles from DoR when I load your quest is severely worrying
as it should be reading the tiles from qst.dat
and it clearly isn't
so there might be *multiple* issues here
but, the module is the clear and obvious first issue
Frankly at this rate, I feel like slowly reverting everything to do with modules is the right way to go
taking things like itemclass names and making those per-quest editable
and just removing things like title screen and sfx.dat
....probably leave modules as just quest progression chains
because that part seems quite solid and useful

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/13/2021 11:21

(replying to @ Moosh "Kinda hilarious that modules…"): idea doomed to failure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 21:15

.....hmm
So, actually digging into this, I have no fucking idea what's actually causing it not to load properly
because it looks like it should
but, regardless, frankly, the title screen shouldn't be *reliant* on qst.dat
it literally *only uses the blue frame*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 22:17

I want to fucking rip my hair out
what the fuck
is wrong with this
thus far I've gotten crashes... where the debugger specifies that it's an allegro file that it can't give me any information on
but when I breakpoint to try to find where it crashes.... it just doesn't crash
and now I'm trying to fix the blue frame
but instead I get literally the entire fucking screen being a solid gray
like what the fuck

what the fuck
what the fuck
what the fuck

but then if I type in a name
suddenly it exists
gaaaaaaaaaaaah wtf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 22:23

....it's failing to open the qst.dat
why
wtf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 22:31

gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
I fucking hate this

ooo-kay
got it back to this
something is *seriously* fucked up with how ZC is reading qst.dat
which, it tries to load *only certain parts of the quest file*, rather than loading it all at once

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 22:46

something to do with that system is clearly broken for new quests
so now I just have it loading the whole qst.dat each time
which might increase load times on the title screen, but hopefully not by much

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 23:19

Perhaps a dumb question, but why does the title screen rely on the quest format just to access graphics? Could it not just use a .dat with only title and menu graphics, or just package the menu graphics in the .exe?

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 23:21

Even for back in the 1.90 days the way this menu is being handled seems exceptionally silly. The only graphics that should need to be loaded from .qst files is the menu icons, and that's seemingly the only part that didn't break

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 23:24

Fuck if I know
The blue frame now is not loading from that anymore, notice that it doesn't have rounded corners
I just made it a blue rect
but, the entire fucking *palette* is loaded from the qst.dat
which is why it was grey blob before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 23:28

(game icons have their own palette)
(which is why they weren't broken)

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 23:28

Could they not have just loaded the main part of the palette from an array? Also does the 4th quest password load from a different quest or just hardcode change colors?
assuming the latter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 23:30

```cpp
loadpalset(0,red ? pSprite(spPILE) : 0);```
it loads a sprite palette from the same quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 23:42

I am so confused

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909032712990511175/909226749911527444/unknown.png?ex=65ecf3e5&is=65da7ee5&hm=71734d6a9f5db5c5fc10b406e13e07703f5a7dc79e2036f4a4156a8121e52fc6&)
the life meter is just that
and I don't know why
according to it, it's drawing the correct tile, in the correct cset
but then it just isn't

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 23:50

what the fuck color even *is* that?
it isn't in the palette that I can see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:09


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909032712990511175/909233658773266472/unknown.png?ex=65ecfa54&is=65da8554&hm=99da9102ef5f7bf0ebfbc4e15f4a7250948d3234a5dd0ff011d9598578ff596a&)
so I drew the palette to the screen to figure out what the fuck is going on
and wtf
after loading the quest and going *back* to title screen, it instead gave

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909032712990511175/909233819578667008/unknown.png?ex=65ecfa7b&is=65da857b&hm=eff928c42f8498d5f0d4e2d2a70b7ee8043eacf8b99ab074951d4647de8277d8&)
so wtf
that should be the same both times
why is it different

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:12

Are those funky csets leftover bits of the title screen palette?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:12

....I think I see a problem

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909032712990511175/909234341194899536/unknown.png?ex=65ecfaf7&is=65da85f7&hm=96c1c9a109d7f339bbf5d9477da68285017b39d1bfd00cbf085252a45ddf216a&)
fixed it
for absolute fucks sake

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:12

Nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:12

`//  loadfullpal();`
WHY IN THE ABSOLUTE FUCK WAS THIS COMMENTED OUT
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:13

Have you tested with custom quest icons?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:14

no, but it shouldn't matter
those load into special palette rows
and won't overwrite cset fucking 1
and this palette loading occurs when it draws the blue frame

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:16

Was more wondering if the commented out line would overwrite those in certain circumstances

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:16

which is drawn once, at the very start of the title screen, before it draws any icons or loads anything to do with save slots
so anything with save slots should occur after

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:16

Gotcha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:20

all 3 instances of frame now no longer use the qst.dat, and instead just draw a damned rectangle

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:20

Nice
I barely noticed the difference until you pointed it out too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:21

Technically, I could make it identical, if I used a subbitmap drawing thing and cleared the corner pixels
...frankly, might as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:27

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:27

side note has anyone ever actually used this name entry menu?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:27

not a clue, it's trash
I had to change to it just to test that it drew correctly

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:27

Cool that it exists but it's a PC game, lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:28

well, people use controller
but yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:37

Anyway, the bugs here are fixed now
but I'm gonna leave this open so I can remember to try removing all the other shit from using qst.dat
gonna mean hardcoding the title screen palette, the heart meters, the selector icon, etc
