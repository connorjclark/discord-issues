~20% of the bootup time for zplayer is from `load_config_file` in `zc_get_config` / `load_game_configs`.

Each call to `zc_get_config` loads two cfg (the base config and the user config).

Should be able to keep both in memory.

Sounds like a good optimization, yeah
Keeping the current app's main and base config in memory at all times seems sensible
(only leaves the odd times that an app writes to a different config, like the couple times ZQ writes to ZScript's configs before compiling)
(or, well, MOST of the launcher. But I don't think we need to worry about the launcher, that's most of what it is built to do and it does nothing but set configs so it doing a lot of that seems okish)

(and, the launcher wants to flush the configs to file instantly every time, so it's always up to date)
