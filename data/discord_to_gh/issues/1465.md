While charging spin attack with magic cost, there's very strange behaviors that can occur:

(Note that the intended behavior is that running out of magic cuts you out of the spin attack when charged)
1) When poking walls with the charge, it skips the spin charge effect and allows you to skip the Magic cost. (Note: This is inconsistent)
2) The exception to this is when poking specifically left for whatever reason. Magic cost is still there, but the spin attack cancelling the charge is seemingly cancelled as well in favor of the poking ability and keeps you in the sword charge state. (Update: This works with any wall. As long as the other bug doesn't occur, this one always occurs)

Okay so it seems like you can do the wall poke cancelling spin attack animation in any direction

After more testing, it seems like both bugs are connected to the Poking animation cancelling either the mana cost or the forced spin attack itself, because it seems like it only cancels magic cost if you poke a wall on the same frame the magic cost happens.
