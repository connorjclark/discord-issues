I opened a quest file in the newest nightly and saved it, and the file size bumped up by a lot (like the size of an uncompressed quest file big).

Try making a new quest with File->New and save it; you'll see that it's over 9 MB big, compared to something like triggers.qst which is only 2 MB big. Are the files not encrypting, or is a bunch of junk data being saved to the quest? Really worrying.

looking at the .qst files in notepad++, the newer version appears to be near-identical to the uncompressed backup saves
so I'm guessing it's just not compressing the quest right

It's tied to the Uncompressed Auto Saves option
if that's checked, then regular saves are also uncompressed

Fixed

Nice catch

What about option to enable/disable quest compression on save? In age of huge disk spaces and lightning internet sometimes file size sometimes don`t matter a lot, yet it could impact positively on quest saving/loading in ZC and ZQ.

You can save as a "qsu" now.
And open qsu files.
(these are uncompressed)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 18:50

It may not be any faster, I'd measure first before distributing qsu files for that purpose.
