The proc for Screen->Enemies need a new tab with ten choose buttons that select a string n the string editor each aired with a numerical edit field to match the string ID (display or manual entry).

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/15/2021 03:32

Editing this would write to MapScr[n]->npcstrings[i].

The data has been allocated for years and is designed to be integrated with 'friendly' enemy types to allow talking to them. (They would display the string allocated to their load slot on correct interaction.)

e.g., proximity, facing the npc, pressed action button assign to speech/read interactions.
for now,being able to set store and save this data is very useful

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Any chance of this soon? i can do the npc side but I have yet to touch the new UI  stuff

It'll be on the list, as most UIs are, when it gets gotten to. There's plenty of GUIs to update.
currently ripping my hair out trying to get everything converted to using `<cstdint>` types

(A lovely `find+replace` attempt left me with >20k errors, so now it's just about whittling those down)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/16/2021 04:03

then I might do it the old way for now

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/16/2021 04:05

Sounds as if you are inventing work for no gain again IMO converting types

finishing talking npcs is higher up my totem pole than syntax reform
