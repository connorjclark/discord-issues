Tile where when Link stands on it, it disables a range of buttons indicated by flags. Plays an error sound specified when you try pressing the indicated button. Could maybe interact with triggers so the effect is proximity based or triggers if the combo is onscreen at all for use with cutscenes? Open to other ideas, just spitballing starting from the idea of a jinx tile.

=== @ P-Tux7 03/02/2023 18:01

I'd like to note that this isn't quite a typical jinx because sword and item jinxes are per-class instead of per-button. Anything beyond a Z1-style quest would allow you to rebind the sword or items to another button and circumvent such a "jinx".

=== @ P-Tux7 03/02/2023 18:02

However, I agree heartily with the idea of some sort of combo or screen flag that renders Link's gameplay functions inert (except for the A button) for cutscenes.

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 20:55

Sword and item jinxes could also be flags. I originally just spitballed the idea as an easier way to implement button disabling in non scripted cutscenes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2023 08:12

(meta) thread name was changed: "Input Disable" combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 16:40

OK, so how about a `Cutscene Trigger` combo
which either sets the current cutscene flags, or ends the current cutscene
the current flags allow disabling of each individual button, and disabling of F6 (If F6 is not disabled, F6'ing out will clear the cutscene flags)
it would trigger based on triggers tab
which could make it proximity, timed, etc etc whatever you need it to be

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:00

Cutscene trigger sounds like my script of the same name which warps you into cutscenes
Do like the ability of being able to disable F6

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:03

When you say "ends the current cutscene" does that mean the flags persist after leaving the combo's effect radius or current screen?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:03

You trigger to start the cutscene, then trigger separately to end it
it doesn't have a "radius" that it stays in effect in or anything (if it disables your movement, how would that make much sense most of the time?)

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:04

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "which could make it proximity‚Ä¶"): this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:05

yeah
proximity there as in, triggers when you get close to it
...proximity being just one of the options

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:05

Also movement disabling with a radius could work with combo cycling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:05

you could have it be purely a radius if you set both triggers to be proximity
but, that's not a setting inherent to this at all, that's just how proximity triggers work in general

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:06

I see...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:08

(i.e. you'd have `Start Cutscene` be `Radius < (some value)`, and `End Cutscene` be `Radius >= (some value)`
but then you could also instead have `Start Cutscene` be `Radius < (some value)` and then `End Cutscene` be `Timer (60 frames)` after that

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:09

Right. But this does not sound like a cutscene to me. "Input disable" sounds like what the combo type is doing. Cutscene trigger implies intent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:09

or you could have `Start Cutscene` be `Hit this torch with a fire weapon`
well, that's what this is doing, isn't it? It's setting you into a cutscene mode where things can play out without player input

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:10

if you check every button flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:10

you could use any number of triggers or combo cycling to make something happen

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:10

what if you only check some of them?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:10

The default is all buttons disabled, you'd need to check any buttons you want to ENABLE

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:10

oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:10

and, if so, then it's a limited-interaction cutscene
for instance being able to just use the movement keys, to wiggle around in the cobwebs you are stuck in
"cutscene" definitely fits imo
given the intent behind it
hell, it could even be used for something as simple as making you stand still while some sort of secret animation plays out

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:12

I think the way you've presented the combo type only confuses things. Maybe check with some questmakers which name (and default flag state) makes more sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:12

like, you light a torch, cutscene starts
the fire spreads slowly across the entire wooden building
it burns down
cutscene ends
or like LTTP when you light the torches and the entire wall moves

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:13

So when you light the torch, how does the cutscene part of the cutscene happen?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:13

some combination of combo triggers and combo cycling
or, scripting, if you'd rather

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:14

does that not sound convoluted and miserable to you?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:14

...how else would you accomplish such a thing then?

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:15

Without scripts? You warp to another screen usually. Combo cycling setups are rarely used in cutscenes because...ew

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:16

...well what would the other screen do, if you wanted it to be an animation?
and, I mean, nothing would stop you from warping to another screen with this either
in fact it would be trivial given that you can combotype effects trigger a warp combo
so you could directly hook the warp up with triggers

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:17

In most cases a series of FFCs and changers. In this case probably just some fires and a crackling sound effect before cutting to black and the house is gone

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:17

...ok, so, you do that
you trigger something with a combo trigger, which starts the cutscene mode, and does a warp to whatever other screen
on that other screen, there's a timed cutscene trigger, which ends the cutscene and warps you back after X amount of time

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:18

Anyways, the way I requested the feature, cutscenes were just one application. You're describing it as if it's the core purpose and I'm confused as to why
Why make button disabling permanent as opposed to per frame? That limits potential applications?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:19

Because making it per frame would be a hell of a lot harder
and I would be not working on that today
would you like to vc and talk about this?

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 18:20

can't right now. I would later though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:51

error sound when pressing a disabled button works too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 18:53

...this does basically everything you've requested, except being "every frame proximity based", which is something that won't happen (needing to check every combo every frame for that seems... a bit much)
(replying to @ Moosh "Anyways, the way I requested‚Ä¶"): ...I described it that way because that's the main use I can find for this to describe it with
(replying to @ Moosh "Why make button disabling per‚Ä¶"): and basically, nothing works "per frame" the way you are saying here
that requires checks every frame for things
by making this on-trigger, you can set an on and an off trigger for it, both of which are events that happen where it is easy to check flags of the triggered combo and do things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/30/2023 20:56

Just sayin

=== @ Moosh 03/31/2023 00:37

Is all of this achieved with combo cycling? Or did you somehow hook it up to an FFC?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 00:38

That's cycling
well, and a single trigger timer
which works mostly like cycling but without aframes
and with trigger stuff instead of JUST changing combos
(the timer times when to re-enable the input)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 00:39

to do that for a full wall texture intead of just a repeating block texture would be more annoying
but would be fully doable

=== @ Moosh 03/31/2023 00:40

Looks painful to set up relative to result but I guess we'll just have to see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 00:40

I mean, yeah
compared to scripting it
but regardless, the wall animation isn't the main point
that is just an example use case for what you'd need a cutscene trigger for
...you can use it with a scripted wall moving animation just fine too
all it's doing is saying "disable input, then 100 frames later, re-enable input"

=== @ Moosh 03/31/2023 00:42

Makes sense I guess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 00:42

it's the most basic of handling possible for a request like this

=== @ Moosh 03/31/2023 00:42

Is it still called "Cutscene Trigger" though?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 00:42

Yeah, I mean, it summarizes its' main use pretty well
and I could imagine expanding it to allow other features like freezing enemies/weapons during "cutscene mode"
which would fit the name even better

=== @ Moosh 03/31/2023 00:44

Just a little bothered just because I have an existing script with the same name and now people will get confused
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=315

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 00:44

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I've stolen worse than just the name from your scripts before, lol XD

=== @ Moosh 03/31/2023 00:45

Most of the features of that script can be achieved not specifically with this combo type but with various combo trigger stuff

=== @ Moosh 03/31/2023 00:47

Will miss having easily placed collision rectangles for the hitbox though. That's something only an FFC script could do really
Also it had a cool feature that makes Link walk to a position. Once again not really usable on a combo type...

=== @ Moosh 03/31/2023 00:49

Anyways, I should just write a script that does what my original request was. Since it's way simpler to do in ZScript. Barely an inconvenience
Forget what even prompted me to make it. I think someone had a request maybe?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/31/2023 01:05

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "well, and a single trigger ti‚Ä¶"): trigger timer?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 01:12

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "trigger timer?"):

`Trigger` tab, thing named `Timer`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/31/2023 05:59

Input Disable combo more clearly implies what it's doing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 17:26

but that isn't necessarily all it will ever do

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/31/2023 17:41

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and I could imagine expanding‚Ä¶"): ^
Cutscene Trigger better captures the idea of what it's intended to do

=== @ P-Tux7 04/01/2023 00:48

"Cutscene Controller"?

=== @ P-Tux7 04/01/2023 00:49

i do think trigger should be kept out of the name as when people talk about "Cutscene Triggers" newbies might think that the *triggers tab* has cutscene stuff in it for every combo, similar to proximity triggers, whereas cutscene stuff is its own dedicated combo type

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/01/2023 01:05

well, it requires use of the triggers tab to work

=== @ vlamart 04/01/2023 23:33

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "for instance being able to ju‚Ä¶"): Could this say, be used on an FFC to restrict movement, but not direction, _and_ drags Link, all as to make a rail shooter?

=== @ P-Tux7 04/02/2023 02:39

how would it *drag* link?
a conveyor?

=== @ vlamart 04/02/2023 02:40

If you stand still on a moving FFC, it moves you too, right, like a moving platform?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/02/2023 02:53

currently, no, it doesn't
though a solid FFC could *push* the player

=== @ P-Tux7 04/02/2023 03:18

i feel as though that would need to be handled VERY delicately
both a checkbox on every combo or a dedicated combo type would be sure to be a headache to code
and don't forget the issues platformers still struggle with, like "should a moving platform affect your jump velocity?" ugh

=== @ P-Tux7 04/02/2023 03:21

i have never ONCE thought to ask for anything regarding solid or platform FFCs to be in-engine and i'm honestly surprised how deedee even pulled the former off
