It's probably a minor thing (maybe not considering the message more icon was a 2.10 feature and that was before there was the ability to have message boxes bigger than 32 pixels tall) but basically the "message more" icon/ press A button to continue prompt for message boxes current use absolute positioning which is not ideal because sometimes I run into situation where I have a big 64x64 message box and the message more prompt ends up inside the box instead of beneath it. What I would like to propose is a new QR called "Message More prompts use relative positioning instead of absolute positioning" which fixes this lingering problem
I can give you a screenshot or two which demonstrates why having a relative positioning option for the message more prompt would be ideal.

Actually I dunno if this qualifies more as a bug.

...is that not what `Y is Offset` here does?
positions it relative to the box's position?

I didn't notice that
My apologies

Actually... I checked that yesterday and it's still sorta putting the message more icon inside of the textbox for big ones
