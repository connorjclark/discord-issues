They seem to display the original Magic Book sprite instead of the upgraded, in both Prototype 8 and Demo ZX, they should display a blue flame after collecting them, instead they show red.

Are they still making a second wand sound when the flame happens?

=== @ NightmareJames 05/26/2022 13:10

Yes, that is fortunately still OK

What map/screen is this, and any idea what alpha this started? (this information will help me debug when I have time to look here)

=== @ NightmareJames 09/04/2022 05:12

The screen was randomly picked, but the quest in question was Demo ZX

=== @ NightmareJames 09/04/2022 05:13

Can't remember when this started (been a while), but it's dated 5/26/2022

=== @ P-Tux7 09/04/2022 05:18

Link to the quest?
IDK if this is exactly the same as the database version

=== @ NightmareJames 09/04/2022 07:12

Demo ZX hasn't changed in months
Just pull it from the Demo Collection
