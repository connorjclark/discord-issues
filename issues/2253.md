```ffc script test{
    using namespace bar;
    void run(){
        foo();
    }
}

void foo(){
    printf("foo");
}

namespace bar{
    void foo(){
        printf("foo2");
    }
}```
This compiles successfully and prints out foo. I was expecting it to print foo2. According to Emily it should not have compiled at all.

yeah, it just doesn't account for `using` at all
in the tiebreak calculation

@ Moosh seems to work fine already for me?

I'm on 2023-3-20
...It errors when I paste it into the buffer but not when I do it via include
I didn't even know that was _possible_

oh, fun
it's rootscope shenanigans isn't it

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> Of COURSE there's a filescope inside another filescope in that situation which I apparently NEVER accounted for
