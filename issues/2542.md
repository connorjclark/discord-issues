Having a water combo layered over a solid ground combo is not respecting solidity

that's intentional; water overwrites solidity below it
could maybe change it

Also there was an odd bug potentially related to this where toggling the  no collision cheat in that scenario, if I were below the solid combos that were on a layer under water I could not walk up through them

that was with sideview swimming specifically, yes? or either way?

=== @ Deathrider 07/21/2023 23:48

only experienced that with sideview
