A function that allows checking if a given color is in an area (masked check) of a bitmap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 02:29

so, like, ```
int bitmap->CountColor(bitmap mask, int x, int y, int checkColor, int maskColor);
 * Checks the area of the bitmap specified by the mask for the specified color.
 * If 'maskColor' is '-1', any non-0 portion of the mask bitmap will be checked. Otherwise, only areas of the mask bitmap that match the maskColor will be checked.
 * The area checked is from `x,y` to `x+mask->Width,y+mask->Height`. If this goes out of bounds, the out of bounds area is ignored.
 * As this is not a drawing function, draws that occur this frame will *NOT* be read- only whatever was drawn to the bitmap at the end of the previous frame will.```

Hmm, so we could do per-pixel collision in theory?

i recall zoria thinking about that but maybe it was a scripted library

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/23/2022 00:31

yeah
`GetPixel` lets zscript read individual pixels
but, you need the script to handle the "collision check"
this function, once I get around to adding it, would handle a lot of it internally

...works just as well with a different ground color, too; it only cares about the exact one red.
