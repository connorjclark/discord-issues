``combodata script faceDir
{
    void run(int dir)
    {
        while(true)
        {
            Waitdraw();
            if(Hero->Dir != dir && ComboAt(Hero->X+8, Hero->Y+8) == this->Pos)
                Hero->Dir = dir;
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}``
This is the only script being used.

....for fucks
Writing dir
calls `reset_hookshot();`
which sets action to `none`

I just made it so that it doesn't set action to none if it's already walking
glad that worked
