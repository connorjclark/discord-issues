See video. The changes get applied in ZC, however they can't be observed in ZQ.

Do you have a recentish build where the bug didn't happen? Like was it before my music update?

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 06:46

(replying to @ Moosh "Do you have a recentish build…"): When was the music update?
The second most recent nightly I have is from July
but I have nightlies going back to May

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 06:50

It's happening in the July 29th build

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 06:50

Okay, so wasn't my doing
Still be nice to get it fixed, but oof...midi.

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 06:51

It's happening in the May 13th build too

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 06:52

I would assume it'd do it in 2.53 as well. This is probably one of those midis that's just doing something unsupported by ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 06:53

(replying to @ Moosh "Okay, so wasn't my doing"): midi shit has been broken forever
like, there's all sorts of weird quirks and shit with it

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 06:54

Oh wow
it's happening in 2.50.2

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 06:54

there you go

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 06:54

just wanted to be sure,  because I did do stuff with volume in particular

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 06:54

on a different midi too, so it's not just that one midi

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/19/2023 06:54

(replying to @ Moosh "I would assume it'd do it in…"): It works in ZC, so just need to call the midi volume fn here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 06:54

(replying to @ Moosh "just wanted to be sure,  beca…"): it being specifically percussion made me think it wasn't yours
because I know midis have had issues with percussion for a long time

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 06:55

It seems to only affect snares???

=== @ Moosh 09/19/2023 06:55

yup, it's a familiar issue to  me too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 06:55

in fact, I think we still have other open bug repots about percussion midis

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/19/2023 06:55

Oh it's just part of the instruments..wtf

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 06:55

oh, no, that was fixed apparently
and was also you reporting, Phosphor

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 06:55

yeah
It's like this is the inverse issue

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 06:56

ZC had a scenario that made percussion too quiet while now there's something in ZQ making percussion too loud

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2023 06:56

interesting lol

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 06:57

It also seems to affect kick drums too

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 07:00

Okay it seems to be random depending on the midi, but it's usually when the midi has a kick or snare as the first note

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 07:01

aaaand now the percussion is inheriting the volume of the last midi played
wtf

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/19/2023 07:03

can you upload the midi?

=== @ Phosphor 09/19/2023 07:09

4 example midis I've observed the bug with. One from VGMusic, 1 from PZC, 2 originally written by me.

Not all really suitable for use in *quests* but still useful for dissecting whatever may be causing this
Deflection Yoke in particular only does it if you set the starting note to position 17
