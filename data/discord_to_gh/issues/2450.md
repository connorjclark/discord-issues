ZC has had freeform dungeon support for twenty years, yet still can’t do doors properly without scripting. We were discussing hacks with the new combo editor to do doors, but why not do this properly? Here’s what I have in mind

- combo attributes would define if the shutter opens based on enemies, secrets, or some other state, or if it’s a one way
- if Link enters the room on top of a shutter combo, it defines all adjacent shutter combos as part of the same door and pushes Link into the room before shutting. If Link enters the room not on top of a shutter combo, the combos initialize closed.
- could be set up similar to lock blocks, where the shutter combo is set to the closed door, and the next combo in the page is the open door combo it changes to when open
- attributes could set the sfx for closing and opening

Couldn't this be done with a solid FFC with a `shutters->` trigger? And wasn't an "auto-walk" flag recently added to conveyers?

Why does it have to be a _solid_ FFC?

=== @ Russ 06/13/2023 15:53

(replying to @ vlamart "Couldn't this be done with a…"): I don’t think so? The solidity could change with the shutters, but it would need to go from push to solid to not push, so would need to use secret state as well. Plus, it’s hackish and awkward. This is a really basic feature that really ought to be straightforward and out of the box

How I did it before was a combo that animates blank to half open while Link walks in, then uses timer trigger the same speed as the animation, triggers the combo to the next one being the solid door. Both of these combos have the inherent flag of Secret 16 which I leave blank so when you re-enter, the door is already open, no animations. All of this on layer 1 or 2. To make it one-way, just don't put any inherent flags on it

That requires using up the screen’s secrets though. Not to mention isn’t at all intuitive for new users

=== @ vlamart 06/13/2023 16:57

Yeah I was just thinking that's a lot of steps to setup as I was typing it out 😝

There's an example of how to do it with triggers in `255example.qst`

should probably try to do something better for this at some point.. not sure about combos though because that would be different per door type

more discussion on the matter https://discord.com/channels/632624568086954015/872709575772602459/1128464923320664094

(Summary of ideas:)
- Add multiple directions of door states for script/trigger use (`Screen->ExDoors[4][8];` using the constant array system to allow 2d array access (matching needed for mapdata.... can that work like that for mapdata, or will it need separate arrays or functions? Probably won't work right for mapdata...)
- Triggers tab can modify these states, as can scripts. Modifying any of them auto-modifies the neighboring screen in the matching direction's opposite direction (i.e. setting `ExDoors[DIR_UP][0] = true` would set the above screen's `[DIR_DOWN][0] = true`). This usage of "neighboring screen" should follow sidewarps.
- Add `Screen Preload->`, `Screen Postload->` triggers that occur in `loadscr`, for load-timing changes.
- Still need a proper 'Shutter' type to handle auto-walk and such behaviors simply for the user.

ohh that sounds grand
i always did wonder why zc never had door copycat combos for the four door directions in the 1.92-2.50 days
while this is mostly irrelevant with the 32 exstates now, this would be great to have out of the box

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "more discussion on the matter…"): not everyone can access that server
(so the summary is a good idea)

=== @ Russ 07/14/2023 18:47

Assuming it’s labyrinth?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/14/2023 19:02

yeah
