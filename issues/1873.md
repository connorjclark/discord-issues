On the Zquest Editor, if you click on the highlighted bar of the box and drag it up or down, it will softlock Zquest. Pic is an example of a dropdown box, but this applies to all dropdowns.

Using A109

109 was exactly a month ago and we fix many crashes since then. It's important to test in the latest nightly, otherwise bug reports are likely stale and not useful.
Unless otherwise shown I'll close this as likely fixed.

Sadly, I just tried it in last night's nightly build, and it's still applicable.  I went into the "Strings" editor, clicked and dragged where I drew the red arrow, and the inside of the pulldown went _wild_ and it started to lock up.  It's still locked up.

I mean, sorry for the work involved, but ... sure.

I thought I literally fixed this, or something almost identical...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/18/2022 00:03

Nah, it's always good to get confirmation. It clears up the first step of "is this really an issue still?"

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 00:10

Yeah just downloaded the latest nightly to test it.

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/18/2022 00:11

I usually wait for alpha releases unless the nightly specifically fixes a bug I reported. It's present in this nightly, too.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2022 22:19

oh, hmmmmm
yeah, this doesn't quite seem like the same issue at all as what was reported before
interesting
