So item does not fall in sideview areas. Like winged items in Link`s Awakening.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 02:14

Is this already a script flag? I agree for it as a checkbox toggle, but if not, it also needs to be scriptable too.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 02:18

Though, per-item Z-axis for top-down (obtaining it with Roc's Feather) is probably too much storage space in the .qst and has to be scripted.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 05:37

Already doable via script, yeah

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 22:14

Better idea: 2 kinds of gravity

1. Item gravity (collectible item)
2. LWeapon gravity (applies for the following classes: Sword (Beams), Wand (Magic), Arrows, Book Fire, Candle Fire, Bombs, Super Bombs, Bait, and Din's Fire)

Faded out on all other items and weapons. Weapons like Boomerangs and Hookshots can still be modded at their own risk via script but not in ZQuest.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 22:17

....uhhh
no
I'm not rewriting 99% of how sprite objects work
All objects have `bool Gravity;` via script
which, are also available as one of the indexes of `MoveFlags[]`
(the bool was added first...)
and that's all you're getting
either on or off
unless Deedee has an insane fit of dev energy

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 22:19

If it's a bool then why can't it apply to in-engine items?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 22:20

and the desire to touch this
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "If it's a bool then why can't…"): ....that it can
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Better idea: 2 kinds of gravi…"): saying no to this
(replying to @ Alucard648 "So item does not fall in side…"): not this
unless I'm misunderstanding you
...which is quite possible, I'm tired and hungry.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 22:21

I don't understand what makes LWeapons' gravity manipulable via script but not by reading itemdata on the fly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 22:22

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "I don't understand what makes…"): ahk, yeah, I wasn't quite understanding what you were saying
so, just saying 2 flags on the item, for the item's gravity and the weapon's gravity?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 22:22

Yeah exactly!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 22:22

....was about to say that might need a compat rule due to some shit
but
....there's no item type that can make more than one different weapon, is there?
Aside from like, things that have melee handles, but melee shit wouldn't have gravity as a setting apply

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 22:23

well there's the sword and wand BUT you - yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 22:23

so it probably wouldn't need a rule
it could be handled by type
....not an EASY request
Doing that for items, is adding *1 checkbox*, and *1 thing checking that checkbox*
Doing it for weapons created by items

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 22:24

there's the case of the Wand Magic producing fire with the Book, but the Book item itseld could handle that the same way that it handles its own power/cost separately from the wand magic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 22:24

is adding *1 checkbox*.....
and all sorts of checks fucking EVERYWHERE all over the engine to check that checkbox
because every single item's "creating a weapon" is a separate code block
nothing is shared
so, not an easy low-effort add

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 22:25

yeah no pressure or anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 22:25

(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 22:26

actually what did you think i was asking for before i clarified? lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 22:27

....I don't know
brain is tired and I thought you were asking for something more complicated than I wanted to even think about

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 22:27

yeah i'm taking a nap myself lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 22:27

IDK why but when I'm tired I become immediately unable to parse what people are saying properly
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Better idea: 2 kinds of gravi…"): I think it was saying "2 kinds of gravity" got my brain thinking weird stuff
because..... nothing to do with what you are asking for involves *2 kinds of gravity*, in any way

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2023 22:28

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....there's no item type that…"): OH, there's also Bombs/Superbombs making the Lit Bomb and Explosion but the explosion really shouldn't need to be affected by gravity ever
yeah sorry, fucking item editor conflating pickup and action

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2023 22:28

*2 separate flags*, *2 checkboxes*, etc would make more sense
*2 kinds of gravity* just made my brain go "....you want me to write a whole new kind of gravity for items?"

=== @ Alucard648 01/08/2023 20:38

I mean 2 separate flags.  1 for item sprite. If flag is set for item to be unaffected by gravity, item will not fall in sideview areas, like fairies. And 1 for Lweapons created by item, when it`s activated, default is "no gravity", except  candle flames, including script generated ones, that are the only lweapon type that are affected by gravity by default in 2.53- versions.
