I'm not sure why, but lately ZQ has been lagging my computer hard lately. It gets better when I close it. I'm using Nightly 61

Not to be a broken clock, but how does it behave in the latest April build?

Unfortunately the same.

The lagging issue has been discussed here: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1021382849603051571/threads/1083641589194297405
It started when Allegro 5 rolled out.

Ah I see
For some reason i can't open that link

=== @ cbailey78 04/15/2023 21:24

Emily has been working hard painstakingly to optimize the GUI's and dialogs for a while.

(replying to @ Jared "For some reason i can't open‚Ä¶"): Sorry, I couldn't figure out how to point you to the channel discussing this issue.  It's titled "Tabs lagging" under Bug Reports.

=== @ cbailey78 04/15/2023 21:27

Emily also had to revert alot of A5 shit earlier this year due to the painfully slow response.  The tile editor was literally unusable.

Oh wow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 07:32

(replying to @ Jared "I'm not sure why, but lately‚Ä¶"): Try changing graphics drivers? (ZCL has a dropdown)
also check the latest nightly (about to come out)

=== @ Jared 04/16/2023 08:09

I've changed it to every single one. I'll try the next nightly too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 08:12

Apparently the nightly fixed the lagging for the other people reporting it

=== @ Jared 04/17/2023 21:45

Awesome

=== @ cbailey78 04/17/2023 23:40

(replying to @ Jared "Awesome"): Ditto!
Palettes -> Levels finally works perfectly!  Way to go Emily!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/17/2023 23:41

(replying to @ Jared "Awesome"): Should this be taken as "problem solved"?

=== @ Jared 04/18/2023 01:46

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Should this be taken as "prob‚Ä¶"): I haven't checked, I'm gonna check tomorrow morning after I get out of work

=== @ Jared 04/18/2023 21:06

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) it's still lagging my computer, even when changing the graphics drivers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/19/2023 06:21

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è then I have no solution for you, it isn't the issue other people have been having
might be something wrong with your computer

=== @ Jared 04/19/2023 20:53

Eh, it moreso only lags when going in and out of the tab. Otherwise it's fine!
It's weird because it used to be fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 14:50

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è IDK, no idea.
Could be something in your computer starting to go
or some random driver update fucking with things

A115 had a lot of performance improvements for dialog stuff. So closing this now.
