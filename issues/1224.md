i was trying to check if a bug where you could "run out" of rupees to use a rupee-using lens with even if you had the magic wallet still existed
but now i just cannot use the lens with rupees at all. in both quests, the lens is set to use 1 rupee as its cost.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 05:59

first quest, start with 10 rupees and magic wallet
second, start with 0 rupees and magic wallet and pick up 10 rupee screen item
can't use it at any time during either
did i mess something up???

Same issue hapeened to a player, who tried to use Lens of truth while wearing Chaos Ring in Link stuck in Castlevania. I fixed that bug by editing Chaos Ring (magic wallet reskin) to give Link full wallet of rupees.

oh, i know the bug is in 2.50.2
i was checking to see if it got fixed now
but now the bug is that i cannot seem to use a lens that uses rupees at all

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:04

really needs to be investigated before alpha 100
because this applies to *newly-created and played* 2.55 quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:23

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "but now i just cannot use the‚Ä¶"): so you are saying that in the first quest here you can't use the lens?
because, uh
....can't replicate that issue
it works fine for me

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:23

ok, time to test it in the very latest one that was released since i made it
i swear i made and tested it in the latest version that existed at the time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:24

unless you were testing on a version literally years old there should be no changes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:30

did you download a fresh build and forget to rebind your controls, perhaps? That's the only thing I could think of

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:31

perhaps, though a and b worked in the same build because i was able to defeat ganon in another test quest in that build which requires those buttons
i'll try again tomorrow
sorry if it was a false alarm

=== @ P-Tux7 11/27/2021 21:21

so should i try again in the new build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/28/2021 04:09

yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/07/2022 10:05

@ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 16:57

fuck, it still doesn't work in these quests
what's going on?!?
the lens is specifically powered by rupees in its action tab
you start with the magic wallet and can find 10 rupees sitting there (in case of that old bug i'm unsure was fixed if you could "run out" of rupees for the lens even with a magic wallet)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/10/2022 22:11

I'm still able to use the lens 100% fine in the first quest posted here

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 10:37

what the fuck
I'm able to use the lens in both of them
that's not a good sign
if it's inconsistent, that either means something really obscure with configs, or something accessing memory that it shouldn't

=== @ P-Tux7 02/14/2022 20:56

Okay, both of these quests work in the latest build without re-saving them or anything
I think I was being dumb and not realizing that the new builds use Alt as the B-Button by default instead of what I had set it to in 2.50.2...?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 21:09

ahhhh
But just to confirm, you can no longer run out of rupees while you have infinite rupees with the lens?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/14/2022 21:20

correct

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 22:27

alright
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíRupee Lens ???

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2022 03:16

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "I think I was being dumb and‚Ä¶"): Eww, I use literally none of the default controls
(Makes it obvious when I forget to set controls in a new build because I would fail to open a quest as my Start is different)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 11:59

we should probably update the default controls

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2022 12:08

I dare not, as I know mine are weird
you can feel free too
`/output/config/zc.cfg`
and also make sure to change the default value in the `zc_get_config` calls in the source
