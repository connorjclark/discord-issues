If there is more than 2 items in an item class, the init data bugs out, off-centering the item checkbox and doesn't allow you to click it on.

@ Saffith whaaaaaaaaaaaa

... Huh. Yep, that's a weird one.

You can still reach them with keyboard navigation, at least, so they're not totally unusable.

=== @ Saffith 09/22/2021 03:19

And they're similarly broken in small mode this time...

Sorry
...didn't notice that it's already been reported...
...so my thread can be  deleted/archieved

Found the issue, technically my fault
...but, more a fault of poor original design.
