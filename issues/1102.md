sword beams from wooden sword have graphical errors if they are horizontal sword beams. https://gfycat.com/SpitefulLivelyAustralianshelduck
item's sprites in the item editor: https://i.imgur.com/wQkl60O.png
and the sprite data of the beam sprite: https://i.imgur.com/28K6Nqy.png
This affects all swords.

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 04:20

Oh that's how it supposed to work
beam shards now have vertical and horizontal sprites

=== @ DarkMatt 10/11/2021 04:21

I see. Built in tiles have not been updated to support this it seems.

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 04:22

yeah
it's just the tileset

??

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 04:22

set it up like this and you should be good

what QR affects this, if any?

=== @ DarkMatt 10/11/2021 04:22

and done

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2021 04:23

and when did this change

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 04:23

when we added extra frames of animation to directional beams

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "what QR affects this, if any?"): ^

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 04:28

if it's on it goes back to the old setup

ahk

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 08:20

oh yeah i need to finally file a report for the broken third tile of slash or whichever it was

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 16:37

what's wrong with slash?
seems to work fine for me

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 19:16

so it has four tiles
i think one of them is unused and instead a flipped version of one of the others is used

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 20:10

First tile is slash up, the second tile is slash down, the third tile is slash left, and the forth tile is slash right.
I've checked each one and all of them correlate properly.

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 20:22

Ahh. I see what's up.
you're using flipped right facing slash
yes, that one uses only 3 tiles, and flip the slash up for the slash right
with flipped right facing slash off it uses all 4 tiles

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 20:56

that means the right-down one is never used

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 20:57

only when you have flipped right facing slash on
when it's off all 4 are used

=== @ P-Tux7 10/11/2021 21:55

oh right spin attack
i wonder if it's used there

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 22:03

(i don't know what the issue is.)

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 22:06

right spin also uses the flipped down slash

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 22:09

the fourth slash sprite is there for normal gb zelda slash where it slashes up-to-right
flipped right facing slash slashes down-to-right and doesn't use the forth sprite
neither does the spin attack
they use the up facing slash slash, but they just flip it on the x-axis

=== @ Guinevere 10/11/2021 22:14

there is no bug
everything slash related seems to work as intended

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/12/2021 20:40

So is there a bug here?
Was busy

=== @ P-Tux7 10/12/2021 21:03

(replying to @ Guinevere "the fourth slash sprite is th‚Ä¶"): why shouldn't they use unique sprites for every direction

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/31/2021 13:23

Gonna mark this as not a bug
