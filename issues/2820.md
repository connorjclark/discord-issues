When assigning SFX in the SFX list, there should be a text box wherein all SFX of the same value are played randomly when any one is assigned to something. Default value is -1. Range is as big as it can be or like 4 digits. 

For e.g. having three sfx with a 6 and then assigning one of those three to the sword, will make the engine just pick from those 3 at random. 

This is probably easier than adding a random SFX function to the places where SFX can be assigned themselves. e.g. adding it separately to items and also combos.

For as much as I agree with this, and I really do love this idea, ... I remember having a script for this and people complained that they didn't like the randomness.  Kinda spoiled it for me.

I guess a checkbox for making it sequential (based on its position in the list) is one solution
