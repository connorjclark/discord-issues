This is basically for @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 
So, swimming works fine. Except that when I reach the top of the water Link gets stuck in an endless jumping animation that I can't break out of.

Also, there doesn't seem to be any gravity when swimming. Unless I am messing up on the setup.

there's new variables in init data

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/08/2021 23:28

Okay, the gravity thing is fine then. But I've adjusted the sideview leaving jump to values of 0.0025 and 1.2005, to try it out. I am able to sink back down, but he doesn't really leave the water with any jump. He gets stuck in his jumping animation briefly, then sinks down in his down animation. And at that point, every directional button makes Link go straight up.

A roc's feather of `power 1` would be a jump of `3.2`, I believe?
Also, if you use a sideview ladder at the top of water, you can easily climb out

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/08/2021 23:36

Nope. I tried putting a sideview ladder at the top of the screen and had the same issue.
And I know the sideview ladder worked cause I was able to jump on it with the feather and climb up first.
Also can't jump out with the feather.

oh dear, more water

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 05:56

I notice you're using VD. Just to check, was the sideview ladder you tested the built in flags, or was it VD's scripted ladder?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 06:42

Anyways, found the issue
it only occurs if NoWaterHopping is disabled; which honestly is a lot more confusing of a name now that Sideview Swimming lets you actually *hop* out of the water

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 09:33

Should be fixed in the next nightly, probably coming out once I'm done fixing the other issues

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 09:36

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíNew Nightly Sideview Swimming

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/09/2021 11:25

I was using the system built sideview ladders. I used the VD Light version to test and change everything to only be set up like a basic sideview water screen with only built in ZC functions.

Anyways, excellent. I've been waiting for sideview swimming to do a couple projects.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 11:43

so sideview ladder doesn't work exiting water from the top?
or is it only when you get into that stuck state?
if the former, does it work if you set the waterjump to 0?
and if that doesn't work, does it work if you turn on "no water hopping"?

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/09/2021 12:16

I'll have to check when I have a chance to get on the computer.

I know when I was exiting from the top he wasn't grabbing onto the ladder. But he was stuck in the water hop state. So it's very likely a water hop thing.

I'll get back to you after I try it out.
Fiance is busy doing computer things atm.

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/09/2021 12:54

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) Turning on No Water Hopping, fixed the issue. Although, I still can't jump out of the water with the Roc's Feather. Not sure if that is intended or not.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 12:54

The roc's feather isn't used to jump out of the water
you just naturally jump out of the water based on the jumping var in init data

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/09/2021 12:56

Alright. Well even then he never goes above the water's surface. You have to have a sideview ladder to get out. I just tried setting the leaving jump to 13.something, and he still won't get out.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 12:57

that's a bug

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 13:02

(replying to @ Architect Abdiel "Alright. Well even then he ne‚Ä¶"): try setting it to 3?

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/09/2021 13:08

I have tried that.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 13:26

hmm
odd.
Can you send the quest?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 14:33

Okay, I didn't account for non-newheromovement stuff
Should be fixed now

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/09/2021 16:35

It's all good. It's only natural to miss something. Especially when dealing with what I can only imagine is a massive undertaking of a feature.
