A quest or item rule that makes the hookshot centered on Link's position, like in an official Zelda game, instead of "left handed", like the weird janky ZC way.

Err, looking at the hitboxes of the hookshot using the show hitbox cheat, it looks pretty well centered
the tiles in classic are drawn off to one side, though

so there's not much to add here
(meta) thread name was changed: ❌🔒Centered Hookshot
