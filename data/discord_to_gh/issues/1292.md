Enemies are ignoring pitfall combos, as per conversation with Emily in the PureZC discord. Regularly happening with moblins and like likes, but more recently with gels and zols as well.
we did it

...Now *that* is a truly frightening video.
Floating Like-Likes are not to be fucked around with, sir. o.o;;;

I should have reported this months ago. I've been giving them inherent No Ground Enemies flags lol

How do you replicate it?
in a fresh quest it doesn't occur

=== @ P-Tux7 12/21/2021 17:44

isnt whether the enemy falls in pits and avoids pits both enemy flags

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 17:45

yes, with this combination the enemy should die in the pit and display a falling sprite

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "in a fresh quest it doesn't o…"): yeah i see what you mean, i just did a test myself and i can't replicate it

=== @ tacochopper 12/22/2021 07:29

ok now i can't replicate it in the quest, wtf

=== @ mitchfork 12/22/2021 16:13

(replying to @ mitchfork "I should have reported this m…"): update to this comment: I just remembered this was a Ghost thing.  Ghost movement functions don't respect pits,  but this is a compat issue with Ghost needing to work in 2.53 and 2.55
so not the same as this bug

=== @ tacochopper 12/23/2021 02:11

(replying to @ mitchfork "update to this comment: I jus…"): i have ghost in the  quest but surely it wouldn't be affecting default enemies like likelikes, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:12

I wouldn't *expect* it to

=== @ mitchfork 12/23/2021 02:12

nah, wouldn't

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/25/2021 20:25

(replying to @ tacochopper "ok now i can't replicate it i…"): unless we can replicate it there isn't much we can do about it
