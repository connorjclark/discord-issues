Next in the line of bugs caused by naming FFC scripts goofy things that are too long, it appears the tooltip for hovering over it can cause a crash. Script name was `AllTheseFeaturesAndIStillHaveToCodeMovingPlatformsMyself`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2021 10:42

A fucking *TOOLTIP* crash? Uuuhhg

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:59

char buffer for display overflow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:07

So, turns out this uses *local buffer arrays* for the thing, different for each thing that calls tooltips....
....I'm curious what the limit is on script names.
.......if there is one.....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:10

...so, uh, fun times, I don't think script names have a limit on length

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:13

setting it up to use `zc_malloc` to create a buffer of variable size, so it allocates exactly what it needs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:20

. . . . well THERE'S an issue
I just made a script with an absurdly long name
and it just crashed on compile

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:32

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ".......if there is one....."): none
make that one longmax
bleah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:34

ok, so the crash on long name on compile is an `al_trace` somewhere...
....and on fixing that, it crashes again one step later in compile.....

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:35

how about truncating scriptnaes on comp to 255chars?
thatca be an OS limit
orienaes
so why not here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:50

....so it turns out `_jwin_draw_abclistbox` has a fatal error handling long strings
It is supposed to cap and read only the first 1023 characters, but.... the array was uninitialized, so the `[1023]` index was not guaranteed to be a nullchar.....

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:52

hahahahah
been there fir years

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:52

yeah, certainly would expect that to have been around a while

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:52

my script naes are never onger than 16 to 31 chars

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:52

woo, now it shows up

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:52

i woud never have foun this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:53

the script name here is `foooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooobaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrr`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:53

as I do not give scripts insane names

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:53

so, uh, `1211` chars long
which was finally enough to break some of this shit
....for FUCKS SAKE
Third crash
on trying to assign it to a slot
how many buffer errors are there in this fucking code?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:54

is why any scriptname needs to be that long other than as a joe
so the joie is apparently o n the usr

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:55

I have no idea why it needs to be this long, but might as well test it to make sure there aren't any crashes

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:55

i tried to ind them all
this one eluded me
I awas init char array to {0}
c habit
and insert null at len-1
safe plus safe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 15:57

. . . PFFFFFT this last one is totally on me
the `script_slot_data->update()` uses a size 128 buffer

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:57

k
now you learnt and know
it happens

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:59

forgot to limit copy len and insert null?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 16:00

aye, wasn't limiting

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 16:00

can ae t i16u
an liit it
and insert nu at th n
solve
we a frak up
I am not immune
no programmer is immune

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 16:04

nyny

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 16:06

OK, now it compiles and assigns without crashes
now to test the tooltip
.....nope, don't even get to
selecting the script in the ffc script selection dropdown crashes
so that's 5 fucking separate crashes from this one thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 16:08

guessing the dropdown has a similar crash to the abclister

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 16:13

ah, and while I fixed the buffer crash for the tooltip
it also has a *separate* crash if the tooltip is wider than the screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 16:17

....err, wider than the tooltip bitmap, which is not as wide as the screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 16:21

Oh
also it's doing `[x][y]` instead of `[y][x]`

@ Moosh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 16:27

....the script name along the top probably shouldn't go that far over

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 16:39

aaand

now that cuts off instead of drawing over the combo side panel
