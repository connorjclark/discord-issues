Bit of a longshot here, but some parts of the combo alias menu simply put could do a bit better. In particular I'm thinking of the organization button that has you copy individual aliases by entering the numbers of the source and destination. Ew

A visual menu similar to the large combo table screen would be ideal, giving a bigger view of the alias list, allowing more natural copy/paste/move operations, ect

That'll be a MASSIVE rewrite

=== @ Moosh 11/24/2021 05:12

As I figured
Just recording my thoughts here for the future

Keep in mind that the tile/combo page menus are *not* guis
they are hardcoded bullshit

=== @ Moosh 11/24/2021 05:13

yup
For a stopgap, would giving aliases a right click context menu be possible?
Like what the combo tables have but with edit/copy/paste

Also the third thing that bothers me with this menu is that you can map blocks of tiles to combos but not blocks of combos to aliases. Despite them more often being placed next to each other, you have to assign one at a time
Be nice if the alias editor allowed shift click. Once again I assume hardcode bullshit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 05:17

aliases are ass

=== @ Moosh 11/24/2021 05:17

Yup
But you brought this upon yourself by recommending a new user use them and reminding me that this awful menu existed üòÑ

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 06:42

true, i do have to add some combo alises for things like z1 dungeon entrances and eyeball+signpost NPCs
