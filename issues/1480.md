@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 
1.  ZCLauncher outright crashes, can't get it to load
2.  X-Box controller bottom triggers still don't work

Unfortunately work has sapped my dexterity tonight, will continue tomorrow

=== @ NightmareJames 03/23/2022 16:35

OK, new bug, the music stopped playing in Level 2, generally with the heart beep, not exactly sure why
It should have looped, and the changed musics did not play
Video shortly

Looks like it's definitely related to conflicting music/SFX

> still don't work

do they work in nightly/latest alpha?
just updated the Release zip, should fix the launcher issue
same link but here it is again

Level Palette editor flickers for a few seconds and crashes ZQuest.  The main palette editor works fine.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "> still don't work

do they w‚Ä¶"): No they did not, but I think that was an Allegro thing
Not sure 100% though

=== @ NightmareJames 03/24/2022 12:59

How we doing with the music bug @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) ?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 03/24/2022 15:59

I haven't reproduced it myself.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 03/24/2022 16:12

(replying to @ cbailey78 "Level Palette editor flickers‚Ä¶"): See the same, confirmed it doesn't happen in latest nightly. will work on this next

=== @ NightmareJames 03/24/2022 16:15

Will continue testing then when I get home

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 03/24/2022 16:23

can you send the allegro.log after each session? maybe the sound issue is logged there

=== @ NightmareJames 03/24/2022 16:48

Music bug showed its ugly head in the Lv. 5 Aquamentus room again, otherwise clean finish to Tiny Quest:  Gold
Build generally passes the basics, we're moving onto Demo ZX

=== @ NightmareJames 03/24/2022 18:01

Build also seems to handle reasonable (and somewhat unreasonable) enemy limits just fine

=== @ NightmareJames 03/24/2022 18:19

Timestamp 40:00:  The Aquamentus room.  The music bug will repeat itself under different conditions

=== @ NightmareJames 03/24/2022 18:25

Now that I've seen this twice, definitely throwing this back at you.  You should probably default this to the directory you're in, maybe even the module directory

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/24/2022 18:38

That's set in the config file
Guessing the configs packaged werent default?

=== @ NightmareJames 03/24/2022 18:45

I guess so, the controller keys were mapped too (similar to mine, but a little different)
I usually don't touch configs unless I absolutely have to
(outside of controller mapping)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/24/2022 18:55

So, yeah, that's not a build issue, Connor just didn't post a clean package
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) `output/_auto/buildpack.bat` should be of assistance for that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 03/24/2022 18:58

I'm putting the output of that script in the release folders, so there probably is a real bug here
(otherwise nothing would run iirc)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/24/2022 18:58

The output of that script is a full build package with all files
It copies the files from `Release` to its' output, along with all the config files and such
If you have 7zip installed, the script should even zip it up for you

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 03/24/2022 19:01

Im just copying it somewhere else where my build artifacts go, it's all the same. Idk if that extra step I did was necessary tho. Is the file not in my release zip??
the config file
afk can't check

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/24/2022 19:01

If you launch the program even once from the folder
It changes some of the configs
You don't want to post it with changed configs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 03/24/2022 19:02

ah, well I'm definitely running the program first before I distribute to verify haha
good to know

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/24/2022 19:02

So should post it *directly* from the script output
For instance, your path was saved in the config file as the default path
(replying to @ NightmareJames "Now that I've seen this twice‚Ä¶"): ^

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 03/24/2022 19:02

Cool, I'll change my process to accommodate, thanks

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 03/25/2022 01:30

and the music bug doesnt happen for you on nightly?
been reviewing the new sound code and it looks pretty similar to old allegro, still looking around for what it could be

=== @ NightmareJames 03/25/2022 02:20

I haven't had it happen on nightly

=== @ cbailey78 03/25/2022 05:43

The new allegro sure seem to open up a can of worms.  first, the file browser bug, then some editor dialog crashing ZQ and who knows what other bugs are hidden, so I'm sticking to the nightly builds for now.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 03/25/2022 07:07

(replying to @ cbailey78 "Level Palette editor flickers‚Ä¶"): Been looking at this bug today. Very nice that it happens for Levels (new gui), but not Main (old gui), which gave me something to compare against while debugging. It _seems_ only the new gui system will modify the hardware screen while the a5 rendering thread is trying to read from it (crash!), and the old gui doesn't, but I wasn't able to fully figure out why.

One thing I did notice is that the new gui will send a MSG_DRAW event a lot more than the old one, which results in `draw_cset_proc` being called every frame vs just once. Perhaps the issue exists with the old gui too, but with this excessive re-rendering it's far more likely to happen in the new gui (without locks).

I added a lock for the screen around the drawing in `dialog_proc` and it fixed the crash and flickering. but it'll still flicker when the mouse is held down (lol) and it is noticeable laggier than the old gui. Still needs more work, but at least it shouldn't crash now. Hopefully we can figure out a way to avoid all those extra MSG_DRAWs?

@ cbailey78 for sure don't use this build as a daily driver, that'd be ill-advised üôÇ I appreciate you giving it a spin and reporting issues so far

=== @ NightmareJames 03/26/2022 16:12

Launcher seems cleaned up.  üëç

Music bug something to do with the looping code

X-Box secondary triggers (the bottom triggers) still not working in Allegro 5
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/27/2022 04:46

does it work here https://gamepad-tester.com/
also share the version that page says your gamepad is

=== @ NightmareJames 06/27/2022 04:50

OK, does work here, where do I find the version?

=== @ NightmareJames 06/27/2022 04:53

Basically says "xinput" and nothing else

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/27/2022 04:56

Just screenshot the entire page. I don't have a controller on hand so I can't see.
I'm looking for a controller name or version number or somethiung
