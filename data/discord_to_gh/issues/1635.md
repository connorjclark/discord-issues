So I was replaying Myst Isle in the latest build of ZC and for some reason I have infinite arrows, which technically shouldn't be happening. Although to be fair it's probably because it's an earlier 2.50 quest

Qst?

If this is the quest I'm thinking of, the creator may have loaded it in a wrong version at some point. I recall encountering some weird bugs in 2.50 as well and that was ultimately the cause, the file was a wee bit corrupted. Dunno if it was ever fixed

If it does this in 2.50.2, nothing to be done here

I recall this quest working just fine in 2.53
