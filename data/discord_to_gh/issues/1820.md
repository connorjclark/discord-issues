=== @ Tabletpillow 08/20/2022 01:54

idk when it does it. It seems pretty random to me at times but it happened twice already out of the five times I've compiled. Using alpha 109

=== @ tim 08/20/2022 01:55

no error in the console, just straight up closed zc?

=== @ Tabletpillow 08/20/2022 01:56

Well when it successfully compiles there will be a notice before it crashes.
I can tell if it crashes if the 'compiled successfully' notice appears and the map editor turns black, it will crash the moment I press ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 02:48

That... Sounds very weird

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 04:52

lets look at the crash reports!

(sorry Emily, unless I pay money only I can look at these)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 04:57

what the heck?
that's a very odd crash point

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 04:57

well it's memory corruption
so something before this
but after compiling
I've actually seen this a couple times
It happened kinda rarely. I just ignored and soldiered on.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 04:58

I'm assuming the `d_keyboard_proc` there is the `y` shortcut to open the compile dialog
...which is absolutely of no help
`refresh` is drawing the entire main UI, usually
though takes a flagset for what parts to redraw

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:01

FWIW it was "first seen" for `nightly-2022-07-27-2`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:03

probably https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/06f00290dc976de653629c950b0f907205e44caa or https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/6ab18b65817cb8df07a0847585f4754525f25594
then
which deals with my `acquire_screen` bullshit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:04

Wait, may want to ignore that. I think that may have been the first-ish nightly with crash reporting.
Hard to tell.
But, that does seem related...
given that is in the stack
and it being rare = related to mutexes/threading

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:05

the prior nightly was the same day, and the alpha that added crash reporting was a couple days prior
so, could be coincidence, buuuut
and those commits are directly messing with the compile dialog, too, so
it's a bit *too* coincidental
I have no idea what would be wrong, though
at least commit narrowing was easy....

noting here that I updated that textbox to a new gui system popup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:10

that right there probably is the issue lines
the other 3 changes that are not on those lines don't seem likely, as one was whitespace and the other 2 only would occur if you clicked the `Script Info` or `Clear Slots` popup buttons
so it almost HAS to be that....

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:24

What should I expect to break without the `sp_*` functions?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:25

they are just calling `acquire_screen`/`release_screen`
so, preventing draw flickering, IIRC?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:26

Not seeing any flickering without them.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:27

also be sure that the `Script Info` and `Clear` buttons work
and that the popup telling you how long assign slots took, actually, is like, visible

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:28

yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:28

ah, right
the flickering was on the `<<` button
that assigns a slot
because, it closes the dialog, and re-opens it
but, it should never close, visually; it should not draw while closed there
because that flickers the dialog out and back in, which looks weird AF

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:28

OK, I do see that.
on <<

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:29

that's what it was fixing
if you can fix that in any other way, feel free

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:29

Yes, I'll look into that.
B/c the crash is happening as we modify the screen var while not owning the lock
which is bad cuz the display thread will invalidate that memory often
so all the lock releasing/unreleasing has to be the issue
but i understand why you did it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:30

What I did appeared to be exactly the way to handle this
so I am confused why it is having any issues
is this not like, the exact point of acquire/release screen?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:48

hmm yeah it does seem like the code wouldn't mess up the locking behavior...may I've gotten unlucky but I was able to repro the crash with the sp_ calls, but not without, so it really could be related...


Anyway, we can avoid the flickering by just avoiding drawing to the screen bitmap directly as some of these dialog methods do. Should be equivalent to draw to non-screen bitmap, then blit that onto the screen in one go at the end. No lock juggling, and blits are atomic (b/c when the dest bitmap is the screen it acquires the lock for us)
So I'll do that, and hopefully that works and we can remove the extra lock complexity. maybe that fixes it. at the least it'll reduce some complexity.
(ex: in `popup_zqdialog`)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:49

the problem is actually the blit at the end of `popup_zqdialog`
which restores the background behind the dialog
realistically, if the dialog is being re-opened, that draw needs to never reach the actual screen, because it should not be seen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:50

ahhh
ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:51

....but, it needs to be done, because when `popup_zqdialog` is called again, it uses that to create the backup to restore, which while we don't want it when the dialog is re-opening, we *DO* need when the dialog is actually closing
the main problem here being how old dialogs work; they close entirely when you click a button, then do something based on the button, then re-open
instead of having code in the dialog to handle the button
This was never an issue before, as the screen did not EVER update, except when `update_hw_screen()` was called
so, since that was never called in any of those button-handling codes, it never displayed that flicker
but switching to a draw thread, it's just completely not designed to handle it
this issue would occur in basically *every single old dialog*
though assign slots was *particularly* annoying and you click the buttons a lot there

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:52

soooo we can maintain a recursive "in old gui" counter and decide not to do that second blit when we are not the root call?
same thing just without mutexes?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:53

what do you mean `root call`?
there's no recursion

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 05:53

ugh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:53

the dialog handler function
calls popup_zqdialog
then after the dialog closes, it handles some code
then re-opens the dialog fresh
...the best thing I could think of, is to split up what `popup_zqdialog` is doing
so, have a function call that blits the entire screen to some temp bitmap, and another that restores that temp bitmap to the screen
and then call those NOT in the dialog popup function, but, outside in the main handler function
that way, it won't ever do that 'restore' unless the dialog is ACTUALLY closing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 05:58

something like this

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1010366294111043704/1010427638617223208/unknown.png?ex=65ebfa91&is=65d98591&hm=a19eb7401d6dd3e53723e9b4ed00d9466904e3ead4b0fbc5231ac3cf7d43936c&)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:00

Yeah just started on that idea
sounds great

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:06

yah that worked great

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1010366294111043704/1010429770376425513/unknown.png?ex=65ebfc8e&is=65d9878e&hm=a3d300096abdb1bb027ea05ac1484c3d046be4b80d24ee8e0e24cd6a1ae062e8&)
i did that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:08

err, but the start call there... does the actual `do_zqdialog`
how is that working on the other side?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:09

Ah, I'm just calling the start thing each iteration lol
i'll break it up more

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:09

you shouldn't need 3 separate things
you should just need to add a start and end
and replace the popup call with `do_zqdialog` itself
the only reason that MSG_START and MSG_DRAW were there, is so the dialog would draw before the screen release call
which was an absolute hack

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:10

Oh, don't need those? Thats why I was gonna do a third fn
but if we can drop
cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:11

yeah, those were added with the release calls

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1010366294111043704/1010430919632486420/unknown.png?ex=65ebfda0&is=65d988a0&hm=4b89d2544492c708b1c973a40e9564007a023ab7d801933ecdef46bb69544795&)
this is what I was going to do
just cache the whole damn screen so it doesn't need the dialog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:13

which, also seems to work perfectly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:22

err, you removed `sp_` calls in `zinfodlg.cpp`
but I see no fix for what that was acquiring for

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1010366294111043704/1010433817691041862/unknown.png?ex=65ec0053&is=65d98b53&hm=1a56bba4ac4ddb522a878d58044c19354f8b92ab5ac3883959e530d692cd5632&)
these 3 had nothing to do with the dialog you fixed
should revert that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:23

Quest rules?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:23

...these also can't be fixed in the same way, because these are new dialogs, so don't use any form of popup function
though they also weren't crashing
I get the feeling it was the `object_message(MSG_DRAW)` that was causing the crash
which, these didn't use
so, in other words, 1 of 3 places that used the sp_ functions was bugged
you shouldn't have removed them from all 3
just the 1

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:26

What guis are these though?
I want to verify it's needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:26

`Quest->Options` and `Quest->ZInfo`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 06:27

i clicked all the buttons in those
seems good
ah
found one
ok
kk reverting that bit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:28

the `load` button in `zinfo` dialog
and the `Ruleset`/`Rule Template` buttons in the QR dialog
and load qr string as well
all of those require re-generating the entire dialog, so they would have flickering without an acquire
....frankly can probably write a better method of handling that into the new gui system, but, that'll be a chunk of work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 06:55

...what's the difference between `ASSERT` and `DCHECK`?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:09

dcheck is from https://github.com/clibs/check
i don't much know how allegro's assert works with all it's options
didnt see it before wanting something like dcheck in my z3 branch

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:10

oh for fucks sake
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....frankly can probably writ‚Ä¶"): ^so, trying to do this now
and my first attempt... just.... hard crashed.
And not even at the spot I expected it to

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:11

i think assert would stop executiton one-stack-too-low in al_assert which would be annoying

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:11

was just wondering, since I merge conflicted when I pulled your reversion
and it had assert in one version but dcheck in the other
wasn't sure which to keep

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:12

hehe it only exists in z3 branch atm
i messed up during a cherry pick

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:13

ahk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:15

...oh lol
funny how that happens
the very assert in question
is what crashed me
...and it appears that, duh, it had every right to. Fek.
This needs to store a vector of temporary bitmaps, instead of just a single one
because it *can* recurse
in some new dialogs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:16

yaaaaaaay
also, +1 for asserts
doing their job
We could have a handle or something that is passed in
or do you want to rely on the call order implicity

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:17

call order should be safe

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:17

famous last words
but sg

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:17

because it's a visual thing
when you open a dialog from within a dialog

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:17

yeah it's pretty much a stack eh
visually

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:17

you're always going to close the most recently opened one
first
so
yeah
you effectively *need* to, actually

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:18

until.....multi-dialog windows you can drag around ü§Ø

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:18

because the end call restoring the background behind the one dialog, is what is required for the next
Well those wouldn't be dialogs
they would need to be something else entirely
....like toolboxes, that I started already in a branch
uhg
you know what I hate?
`vector.pop_back()` returns void
instead of returning the element

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:19

so yeah a BITMAP*[3] or something sounds good enough?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:19

I was just going to make it a vector so it can handle whatever size

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:19

sure. this isn't hot code so w.e.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:20

which reminds me, I wonder if `std::vector` in mapscr (which was an aspirational thing) has any noticeable overhead
i'll try replacing with a static array and see if I noticed a better uncapped fps

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:21

yeah, it has no reason to be a vector
even if it doesn't have much overhead, reverting it to an array is probably sensible
HAHAHAHHAHA
SUCCESS
Now any dialog can just set
`rerun_dlg = true;`
before exiting
and it will automatically re-open, BEFORE the end call
the only thing that won't be regenerated is anything in the constructor of the dialog
so, the 2 dialogs that needed this, I just moved a couple things from the constructor to the view() function
so that they will be re-called
and viola, no more sp_bullshit needed for anything
....gonna leave those functions there in case they are needed in the future, though
```cpp
static std::vector<BITMAP*> zqdialog_tmp_bmps;
void popup_zqdialog_start()
{
    BITMAP* tmp_bmp = create_bitmap_ex(8, zq_screen_w, zq_screen_h);
    
    if(tmp_bmp)
    {
        scare_mouse();
        blit(screen, tmp_bmp, 0, 0, 0, 0, zq_screen_w, zq_screen_h);
        unscare_mouse();
        zqdialog_tmp_bmps.push_back(tmp_bmp);
    }
    else
    {
        *allegro_errno = ENOMEM;
    }
}

void popup_zqdialog_end()
{
    if (zqdialog_tmp_bmps.size())
    {
        BITMAP* tmp_bmp = zqdialog_tmp_bmps.back();
        scare_mouse();
        blit(tmp_bmp, screen, 0, 0, 0, 0, zq_screen_w, zq_screen_h);
        unscare_mouse();
        destroy_bitmap(tmp_bmp);
        zqdialog_tmp_bmps.pop_back();
    }
    position_mouse_z(0);
}```
so, these now do the whole screen, don't take any params, and vector-store multiple bitmaps

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:24

> ....gonna leave those functions there in case they are needed in the future, though
> 
why tho
it'll be in source control
forever and all time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:24

eh, why dig them out again?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:24

because keeping dead code around is awful for reading code

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:24

we can clean them up at some point, if they are no longer needed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:24

that's like the hardest thing about learning how ZC works
all the dead code

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:25

how much dead code is there lying around that isn't used for anything?
actually curious

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:25

Dead code, repeated code, etc. just TOO MUCH code really
I can't think of many examples of dead code atm (falling asleep...)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:25

there's a lot of fucking repeated code

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:25

but you sure know examples of the others

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:25

which I've tried to work on when I can

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:25

so really "too much code" lol
oh-like, the entire romview thing lol
dead app lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:26

aye, yeah
it was actually used at some point
but, people just... stopped caring to maintain it
and just packaged an old version
and then, I removed it from the package, to absolutely no complaint

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/20/2022 07:27

which stuck around in some low level methods re: screen scaling
that took a bit to realize it wasn't even needed/used anymore (and scaling code could be simplified)
just one example

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:28

yeah, fair
I'm gonna just give it `//!TODO trim`
should indicate it isn't really needed, fairly well
anyway, this issue should be solidly dead
