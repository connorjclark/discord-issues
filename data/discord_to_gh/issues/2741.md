Should be changed away from Zora to something else.  Maybe "Fish" is too generic because it's friendlier than something that spits a fireball at you.

Oh, err
not a typo
at all
The checkbox name is a hardcoded name, so it was changed
but the name in the infobox is reading from the quest file
that's the actual enemy name of the enemy in the enemy editor
so, if you change the enemy name in the quest file from `Zora` to something else it should be reflected there @ Changeling
