I know Mani made a request pertaining to a door combo set wizard, but I think the following suggestion is much lower lift for the meantime.

Basically, I’d like for the door combo set editor to remember and scroll to the prior combo page when you assign new door combos. This is similar to how aliases are currently handled.

Currently, you either need to manually scroll to the desired position each time, or use a keyboard shortcut to paste the selected combo into the editor. Neither of these are great options. Both are tedious, and the paste shortcut may require the user to exit the Door Combo set editor to select new combos periodically.

hmm, seems like that menu does not respect the `Ctrl+Click to go to last page` shortcut
Comparing things to aliases is also bad btw as that dialog is janky and old too
the way most new dialogs handle it is better
(aforementioned `Ctrl+Click` goes to the last page, while normal click goes to the combo that was previously set)

...also WHAT THE FUCK
The door dialog
treats LShift and RShift differently
they do different things
and are also useless because it goes too fast
bleh

ahk, just converting this crap to work the same as the New Gui combo selectors
better for consistency

Hey, whatever works
Door combo sets have a lot of potential, I think they’re probably underutilized due to how cumbersome they are
