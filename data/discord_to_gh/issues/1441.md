For some reason, it's showing din's fire on the B button, and custom item (the lift sprite) on my Y button. If I play with the din's fire sprite, it changes to whatever I pick. Idk why it's showing it

(Turns out I don't need the din's fire dummy)
this is all I need

And no, Link doesn't start with this item
It does this with the item on and off in init data
