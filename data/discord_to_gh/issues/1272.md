Before, hitting T in the combo editor would take you to the tile that was currently set, as of now that functionality is lost

(replying to @ Deathrider "Before, hitting T in the comb…"): For the record, *WHEN* is 'before'?
because uhh, this isn't in 2.50.2

I recall being able to perhaps a year ago or so, sorry if that isn't helpful I do not remember.

oh, huh, it just wasn't working for me when I launched before
2.50.2 is always fun

ahk, fixed
