A flag on these items where, instead of using the current sword sound (or a volley of current sword sounds) when a spin attack or hurricane spin is executed, they use the sound set in the scroll item's itemdata. This does NOT make the hurricane spin play the sound repeatedly, to allow for better customization and coordination to the hurricane spin's user-set length, so users would have to loop it themselves if they desired that.
