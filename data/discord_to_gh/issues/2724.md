I'm posting this FR here because I fear it might be forgotten if I didn't bring it up here, the convo I linked basically laids out what I have in mind.

@ FireSeraphim ....already exists
Moosh even showed you in that channel like 2 messages below where you linked, lol

Oh

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) No, I don't see any options for selectable text in the subscreen editor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 23:21

it's literally ANY widget
on the selection tab
text, item, tile block, rectangle, frame, ***anything***.

if you want it to change pages on button press, that's all right there

I set it for the text entity as shown and it doesn't work at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 23:41

How did you set it up?

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/09/2023 01:09

Can you throw me a demostrational quest file with working selectable text?
It would be faster

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2023 03:44

no, because I'm tired af and not up for building that rn
why don't you ask the person who had a video of it working that moosh linked you to?
they'll already have a setup,
