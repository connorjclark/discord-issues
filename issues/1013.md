So NightmareJames just ran into this one in Level 6 of ZNR, in the boss key room, during a stream. Went downstairs to collect a boss key, without killing all of the CSet 9 Keese in the room.
This was a brown dungeon with many dark rooms in an NES-tileset quest, so these Keese were colored black to blend in with the darkness in the room. Upon exiting the item cellar, the Keese in the (upstairs) dungeon room had picked up the CSet 9 from the item cellar's level palette, which was cyan like the Level 1 palette in the classic tileset, making the Keese no longer blend in with the darkness.

This one's been happening for a while, waiting for a second on it though, which @ 4matsy just did

i think this just needs a qr "cellars copy current dmap palette"
it may apply to staircases as well

Okay, looking at it, it seems to happen only if the original screen is a dark screen
