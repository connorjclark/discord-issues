To be turned into ZInfo options:
-Enemy types
-Enemy animation types
-Enemy walk types
-Room types
-Guy names (zinfo or loaded from e editor?)
-EWeapon names
-LWeapon names

To be turned into `Quest Pack` options (new thing that needs to be made, ZC only):
-1st through 10th quest
-skip names, associated data

yess
i hate modules

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 07:01

I've already moved itemclass names + help text, combo type names+help text, mapflag names+help text, and counter names all to zinfo. This is the rest that still needs to go.

Yeah guys should be loaded from the enemy editor to accomodate for a possible making your own Friendly Guy family enemies
check for all enemy IDs that are in the Guy family and then pull their names

also, QRs contain copyrighted names too, so they need to be "genericized" or as ZInfo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/23/2022 00:32

oh, bleh, true
Any chance you'd mind helping with that, P-Tux?
it's all `src/dialog/quest_rules.cpp` and `src/dialog/script_rules.cpp`

=== @ P-Tux7 08/23/2022 07:19

yeah
would you prefer just a straight-up hardcoded rewrite of the rule text instead of making them ZInfo?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/23/2022 07:47

zinfo is only for things that change from quest to quest
qr text... should definitely NOT change from quest to quest
nor should users be able to... customize it
that doesn't really make any sense at all
