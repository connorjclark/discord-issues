So this is pretty cursed. I'm on call with Nightmare trying to fix some bugs in his quest, notice something up with the active subscreen. Newest build, he's not able to reproduce. Everything seems to work but the sprites of items are not displaying the right tiles. Here is a screenshot of EZGBZ's default subscreen to show what I mean

Might be hardware specific, Nightmare was not experiencing the same issue, but for me it occurs with all quests. Anyone else having this?

=== @ Moosh 03/24/2023 07:11

(meta) thread name was changed: Active subscreen editor items not drawing properly

=== @ NightmareJames 03/24/2023 12:58

Emily and Moosh:  Repeating what was I said in Moosh's DM:
Ask if the minimum A5 driver is OpenGL3 or better
I remember 4matsy having some issues too, and I had an issue with another app with this ancient computer
(this computer runs OpenGL3, so I'm barely able to run the other app, with some hitches)
Hope this is useful in some regard

=== @ P-Tux7 03/25/2023 01:14

...squaforce?

=== @ NightmareJames 03/25/2023 20:12

Mostly deals with driver issues and particulary Vulkan, I'd refer to Emily for more on this

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 04/05/2023 08:00

I am having this issue also

My subscreen items are still all there and they still have their sprites in item editors but, they are not all showing in the subscreen editor
for some strange reason only the top ones will show.
They are only seen in the game when playing however only.
I just updated to latest Nightly tonight. I use the x86 version

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 05:54

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) so uhhhhh...I noticed this is happening in ZC now too. That would make the issue a wee bit more severe. It seems like the Y position of all items are getting inverted
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1088692109130879011/1115156736014290965/2023-06-05_01-52-34.mp4?ex=65e56224&is=65d2ed24&hm=aeb146c775db6a05662a1509e94ab3b450ae31237e71ba3a2427b5a144a15ee2&)
This is a fresh quest and seems to only be affecting the item sprites

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:21

(replying to @ Moosh "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) so uhhh‚Ä¶"): this feels like a separate report

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:23

Fair enough. Both cases are visually the same result: Subscren objects being drawn at the wrong position. I figured it'd make sense to report this one as an update to the previous unresolved report
will go make a new one though

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:27

Wait WTF?
Just went to double check on the new build today and now it's not happening

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:28

. .  .fun

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:29

Nothing in any of these commits indicates they touched the subscreen or item code üëª
And I'd last updated just a couple days ago

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:29

did you last update 4 days ago or more?
because that's the last time `subscr.cpp` was modified

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:30

three days exactly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:30

...err, nope, that wouldn't have changed a thing though

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:30

If it's fixed it's fixed I guess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:30

all that changed was fixing the Show Hitboxes cheat showing subscreen item hitboxes

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:33

Seems the other bug was partially fixed too at some point, though the subscreen still isn't looking 100% correct. That's supposed to be a boomerang / selector, not a rolling log

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:34

I legitimately have no idea

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:34

I mean, it's the subscreen. That's a given üòâ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:38

(replying to @ Moosh "Seems the other bug was parti‚Ä¶"): what is the bugged object properties

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:39

I was expecting it to be a damned item override or something odd

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:39

And then Selector 1
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1088692109130879011/1115168003345100891/image.png?ex=65e56ca2&is=65d2f7a2&hm=f0165606125790cdf27cefaa590864ffe0ed48ee536f795af23ad3bb817116a0&)
okay it's definitely the selector and not the item
deleting it did this

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:41

The tile being drawn is 20141. Seemingly random
1209 for the selection 1 item

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:43

And nothing I change in the editor appears to change that tile from 20141

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:43

What's this qr?

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:44

It's checked
Unchecking does not appear to fix
What does that description even mean?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:45

(If you have like, a 2x2 item, it'll actually display a large cursor around the item)
(stretches it)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:47

(replying to @ Moosh "And nothing I change in the e‚Ä¶"): is it ever 20140 by any chance?
because I have something FUN for you

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:48

doesn't seem to be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:48

That's the tile of the default quest's selector

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:48

Firebird also has the same tile 20141

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:48

which seems REALLY sussy

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:48

OH BOY

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:49

....oh my
and actually
it's displaying only 20141 in the editor here to
hahahahahaha
it just *looks ok* so it's not as obvious

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:52

ahahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha
the selector never animates in zq
methinks
because
.....it was animating at double speed in zc

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:53

Yeah I don't believe it ever did. Just using its last frame I assume? And specifically the last frame from the default classic set now apparently

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:53

because of the passive and the active both animating
so someone

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:53

goddd

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:53

made it only animate
on the passive
and thus
it's animating ***only once when it first creates the object***
thus why it's 20141 instead of 20140
and it's ***never calling animate again***
....the problem being, the animate call is also what ***updates the selector when you load a new quest***.
because the selectors are just global objects that always exist

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:54

oh fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:54

so as soon as it first creates them in zq
it NEVER UPDATES THEM for ANY OTHER QUEST you load
and statically displays that exact tile
. . . I changed that selector in the default quest at some point, which would be when you NOTICED this bug.
Though, the bug has been PRESENT for as long as it has not been animating in ZQ

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:55

incredible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:55

which, given the comment is labeled `-DD` for DarkDragon......
that's old

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:56

and the only reason I noticed it the first time was that every item went invisible so I went to compare subscreens from various tilesets
Suppose when people go tileset sifting they rarely open the subscreens and that's why this was never caught

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:57

and most tilesets probably have the selector in the default spot
I would assume most people would probably just edit it in place
but, I updated the default to be a much fancier and longer animation, so I needed space elsewhere

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:59

yeah this sure is a thing in 2.53. And probably every version ever. Whew

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:59

also it does not respect the cset of the selector at all

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 06:59

Glad this went from incomprehensible subscreen corruption to one of the oldest bugs I've ever encountered

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 06:59

because it's blue in default when it's actually supposed to be red
....which I am actually really confused about, because it's just creating the item from the item ID like any other?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 07:08

. . . the cset has something to do with Flash not working

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 07:16


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1088692109130879011/1115177199214010388/2023-06-05_03-15-49.mp4?ex=65e57533&is=65d30033&hm=e1f673f35b92381544af42686050967a7f8a366ca4fc51275e32cdf848e3cec0&)
fully properly animating and respecting flash
NO item would have respected flash, for the record, as, that relies on a ***global frame counter variable that ZQ literally never touches aside from initializing it to 8***
...now ZQ increments that counter during subscreen animation only

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 07:18

weirdest fucking bug here lol
but now it is fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/05/2023 07:22

While I'm at it I'm removing DD's old comment and replacing it with my own which details why it works how I have it working

`Initial Commit` has this code lol, so it's been bugged for this entire repo's lifetime
