```class foo{
    foo(){
        printf("Oh boy, here we go again!\n");
        bar();
    }
}

void bar(){
    return;
}

ffc script FucktionCall{
    void run(){
        foo f = new foo();
    }
}```
Internal functions like printf() work fine, but the second I call bar() it jumps back to the start of foo()

So, looking at the ZASM....
```cpp
 SETV d2,0
 ZCLASS_CONSTRUCT CLASS_THISKEY,{0}
 PUSHV 0
 SETR d4,SP
 ALLOCATEMEMV d2,27
 STORED d2,0
 WRITEPODSTRING d2,"Oh boy, here we go again!\n"
 LOADD d2,0
 PUSHR d2
 PRINTFVARG
 POP d5
 LOADD d3,0
 DEALLOCATEMEMR d3
 PUSHR d4
 PUSHV 0.0062
 GOTO 48```
`printf` is inline, so, it literally copies the printf ZASM into the constructor- so that works fine
that `GOTO 48` at the bottom....
Well, it looks like it SHOULD be the jump to go to the `bar()` function
....except line 48 is the `PUSHV 0` that's the third line of this block.
So it's.... calling itself.
Infinitely.

the addition of constructors being able to call other constructors broke this
...fixed.
