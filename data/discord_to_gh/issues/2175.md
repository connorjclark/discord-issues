Similar to how the tile editor now estimates the selected color, it'd be nice to have the combo list give an estimated color for the selected combo in a cset. It'd do the same thing for every color used in the tile and return the mode result.

=== @ vlamart 02/12/2023 17:23

There should be some kind of colour threshold, just incase if it calls a tile black (because of outlines like in gb) or transparent (like snow weather textures)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2023 17:26

Could add it as a tooltip on the combo preview
And list the top 10 color name appearances

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2023 17:44

If it groups similar colors down to the basic hues, black, white, gray, would outlines still outnumber fill colors? Probably still best to exclude black from being the top result anyways, most people can identify black

=== @ P-Tux7 02/12/2023 19:41

I'd definitely like this to be a toggle so the computational impact is optional

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2023 19:55

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "I'd definitely like this to b…"): It caches results
so the computational impact happens at most once per color

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2023 20:00

Wondering how it'd work on tile animations. My thought would be it should only calculate for the first frame because having the color name cycle rapidly sounds unhelpful
And an average of all frames is also likely to be unhelpful

=== @ P-Tux7 02/12/2023 20:05

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "It caches results"): schweet

The all frames makes that water a lot more `Royal Blue ?`

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 02:46

Raw Sienna sure is a color that I intuitively know what is 😛

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 02:47

I grabbed a list of colors

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 02:47

Assuming this is just some table of common colors you found

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 02:47

yeah
the `?` at the end indicates that the algorithm is unsure that it is correct
it can theoretically add like up to 9 `?`'s to indicate being really really unsure
but, more than 2 is probably impossible with the amount of data I've given it

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 02:51

Are the `?`'s indicative of distance from the closest color in RGB or is it doing something more complex?
or wait a sec...why would water have light tan, black, and green?
oh because cset 2 I guess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 02:53

cset 2, yeah
```cpp
std::string const* closest_color_name(int r, int g, int b, zfix* wei = nullptr)
{
    double best = 99999;
    std::string const* match = nullptr;
    for(auto& pair : colorcache)
    {
        int nr = (pair.first&0xFF0000) >> 16;
        int ng = (pair.first&0x00FF00) >> 8;
        int nb = (pair.first&0x0000FF);
        
        double weight = sqrt(pow(r-nr,2)+pow(g-ng,2)+pow(b-nb,2));
        if(weight < best)
        {
            best = weight;
            match = pair.second;
        }
    }
    if(wei)
        *wei = best;
    return match;
}```
So, this is how it searches for a nearby color
If the RGB exactly matches a named color RGB, it just gives you the name
Otherwise, it calls this- and caches the result, so it only runs this search once per RGB value per zquest launch
```cpp
double weight = sqrt(pow(r-nr,2)+pow(g-ng,2)+pow(b-nb,2));```^The key point

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 02:54

how does caching work?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 02:55

It just has a map of every rgb value to a string
it stores the known names in there

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 02:55

well that works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 02:55

and then if an unknown name is called, it searches, and caches the new string

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 02:55

how  big can a map be?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 02:55

A map is like a vector, but unordered
so, like, stupidly big
and to use indexes 21435 and 1233 only makes a size 2 map (instead of a size 21436 vector)
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "```cpp
double weight = sqrt(p…"): Anyway, back to this
So, the weight is the square root of the sums of squares of differences of rgb values
....I googled and found this as a result, it worked far better than anything I tried myself.
The color name it displays will always be the color name with the lowest weight. It compares against *every single named color*, so it will *always* find the best match.

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 02:58

Well I'm not about to argue with google

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 02:58

Now, as for the `?`'s
If the weight of the best match is `>10`, it adds a `?`
`>15` adds 2

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 02:58

Math confuses me a little though. Like why a square root is better than an average

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 02:58

`>20` adds 3
etc

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 02:59

Makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 02:59

(replying to @ Moosh "Math confuses me a little tho…"): the square root of sum of squares gives more weight to multiple differences
so, if you have 2 colors, both with the exact same G and B values, but 20 difference in R, what's your weight?
`sqrt(20^2)=20`
What about the same B, but 10 different R and 10 different G?
`sqrt(10^2+10^2) = 14.1421356`
10 different of all 3 would be `17.3205081`
...which is still lower than 20 different of a single value
math is fucking weird

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 03:46

Is this grouping colors by basic hue?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 04:02

No
The order is purely by commonality; the number on the right is how many pixels of the combo are that color
and the name is just the name from the list that is closest to that color RGB

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 04:21

ah. more meant because the first result was green with no descriptor. Not light or dark green, forest green, olive green, pea green, Link's tunic in Zelda 1 green, ect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2023 04:24

(replying to @ Moosh "ah. more meant because the fi…"): it's just close to the color that happens to be just named `Green`

=== @ Moosh 02/13/2023 04:24

makes sense

Figured being able to see the current color of your tile would be useful
