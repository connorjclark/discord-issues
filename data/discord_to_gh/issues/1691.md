I set up generic combo and then I set up a sprite (under Sprite Data) of a poof animation. 

The animation seems to loop and show the beginning frame for a split second before properly vanishing. Shouldn't it just vanish after showing the last frame

Latest Nightly, allegro 5 debut build. 

Also don't mind my protagonist's true form (a frankenstein of several souls from several heroes) when she stabs.

(replying to @ Majora "I set up generic combo and th‚Ä¶"): what are the values of the poof animation?

this seems to happen with faster speed, I just made it slow to make it easier for me to see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 08:19

Set the speed to be faster, where it still happens

and then run it in this exe
and give me the allegro.log after you watch the sprite do it once
err, and delete your allegro.log file before you cut the pot
(should make the pot print be at the top of the new file)

=== @ Majora 06/24/2022 08:21

gotcha, I will ping you with the info/stuff

=== @ Majora 06/24/2022 08:23

Update: Old Exe: seems to happen semi randomly (or maybe the frame isn't appearing because of allergro/windows display bullshit) EDIT: Based on the log definitely some windows display bullshit. the sprite is animating identically regardless of what I see.
speed 4

I have two pots on screen, if its weird that the log has it twice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/24/2022 09:46

=== @ Majora 06/24/2022 09:47

Does that fix it?

=== @ Majora 06/24/2022 09:53

Looks like it!
