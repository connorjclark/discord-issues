Somewhere after a116 and in current nightly, when the player enters certain screens in my quest, the game automatically plays the "Secret Sound" sfx as defined in Screen Data even if the "Play Secret SFX on Entry" checkbox is empty. If that checkbox is filled, the secret sound will be played *twice*.
This odd behavior is known to occur on screens 17:74, 17:75, and 38:7D.
I am unaware of anything I could have done while editing my quest that might have caused this. When it started happening, I hadn't even edited those screens for several previous builds.
The quest file is attached for testing purposes.

Not home to check anything but
Check the combos on the screen, did you accidentally edit a combo and give it like trigger info?

Is this only after resaving in a later version, or is this the behavior when loading it directly from an older ZC? What's the version you are currently developing the quest w/?

I know what I did. This isn't a bug, each screen had a particular torch combo on it that I had set up with triggers. As such, they were triggering on the instant the screen came into view.
The only reason I didn't catch it was that I forgot what I did and didn't label it.
