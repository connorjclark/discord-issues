When an Arrow hits a Combo that blocks it(Tested with Wooden arrows and the Block All and Block L1 Arrow Types), the projectile doesn't properly end, leaving the impact sprite flashing in place. This also disables firing any further arrows until you leave the screen.

That's weird AF.... @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?

Block L1 Arrow?

Block Arrow(L1). There's a similar combo type for the Boomerang.

Huh, must have missed it, thanks
You know, I may as well request a Blocker combo type, thanks for the idea

*sigh*
So weapons live an extra frame after "death" for scripts to be able to do 'on death' effects, or revive the weapon
arrows apparently are, in that extra frame, resetting their death animation timer
so needs a special check...
should be fixed
