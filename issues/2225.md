@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) Add level QRs to CSets 10, 11, 12, and 13? (14 is the special no touchy, right?)

is 14 used in zquest?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/09/2023 01:32

14 is used for boss palettes

Bump, but also requesting Fade CSets 10-13 as well

Might as well throw in CSet 0 as well - pretty sure the dungeons in the Outlands hack have different CSet 0s. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
