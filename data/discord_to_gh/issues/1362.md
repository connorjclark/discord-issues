The idea is to have a new fountain function that you can toss item/weapons into a pond and it upgrades them using a fairy in a wiseman room. You have a Text choice selection option, and everything seen in this video, is exactly how it would work but done in Zelda Classic.  It would be a mock-up of this system into ZC engine, but simpler. You have a Upgrade List in - Misc Data>  Weapon Upgrades, where you can set up 'what item' upgrades into what other item manually in the editor.   Video Example is below:  Basically you can make it update up to 9 times at least of an item each. Lastly the Fairy over the fountain does not have to be a giant fairy, just a single tile size NES Fairy.

Oh right, this is what that unused "Item Pond" room type was originally going to be, if I remember right. 🙂

Unused item pond?

Part of it would be a wise guy room mechanic.
