yeah, that's not a bug
The default template quest has bugfixes that are not applied
so, it's asking if you want to apply them
(meta) thread name was changed: ❌'compat rules dialog' shows on new quest

This is a pretty silly first experience when booting up ZQuest for the first time ...
Why can't the new template use good rules

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/26/2022 05:12

I need to update the template
working on it
But even if it is updated
as soon as another compat rule is added, the popup will appear again
I also planned to add a config option to force `File->New` to automatically do that without asking
just, haven't gotten around to it yet
There are reasons not to want that, though, so it does have to be togglable
