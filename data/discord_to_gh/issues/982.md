I'm having a bug with the enemy editor. I went in to edit stats for enemies, saved the stats. Then when I went back into the enemy editor it had set its turn freq., halt rate, step speed and homing factor to 32767.

I tried this with enemies that had no scripts on them on a screen that also had no scripts on it.

I've edited ghost's shadows a little bit, but haven't touched anything else.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 18:31

Btw, this could be important. The only script I've added since then is the updated version of Newbie Boss. I don't think it would cause the problem though.
I had the old version and updated to the newest one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 18:32

a script literally could not cause a ZQ issue

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 18:33

That said, I've only edited a couple constants in ghost and Newbie Boss, which I can't imagine should have any effect, especially on normal enemies with no scripts on them.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 18:33

scripts don't run in ZQ
and the code to run scripts isn't even in `zquest.exe`

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 18:34

I didn't think it would. But I figured I'd at least mention the only change I've made since starting.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 22:06

...so, I edited an enemy, and instantly hit `OK`
Step speed became 1000
so I edited again, and hit `OK`
step speed became 32767, which is `MAX_SHORT`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/03/2021 23:07

Wtf

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/03/2021 23:18

Yeah. That's how I felt too.
It wasn't like this 2 or 3 nightlys ago.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/03/2021 23:20

Nothing about the code directly surrounding it has been changed
So either random build corruption or some weird bug
But, I have to do a lot of work to build now, because some PRs were merged and broke compile

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/03/2021 23:25

Oof

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/04/2021 00:03

Hopefully figuring out what's happening isn't too difficult.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 00:14

aye, should have it fixed tonight or tomorrow, hopefully
this can't be that outlandish, building it in debugger mode should lead me quickly to the issue

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/04/2021 00:23

Okay. Thankfully there's an easy path like that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 01:21

So, I changed how `vbound` was set up internally
and it uh
was acting REALLY fucking weird
and not doing what it should have been at all
so, I re-worked it *again*
and now it is working again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 02:08

so it was working again until I tried to build it in release instead of debug
and I fucking hate C++ once again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 02:26

ok, got it fixed for real
fucking pain
will put out another build once I do a couple other things
(want to try to get the external parser working)

=== @ Architect Abdiel 09/04/2021 02:29

Sounds like a pain. Weird how it would work in debug but not release. Would think it would work in both.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 02:29

some sort of linker error with template functions

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/04/2021 03:36

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) was this a you error?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 03:43

aye, certainly was
