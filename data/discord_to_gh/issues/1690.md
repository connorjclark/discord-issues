Pressing `Alt+Q` is supposed to drop the `Quest` menu, but this no longer works (it instead behaves the same as just pressing `Q`).
Noticed this because `Alt+Q -> T` is my keyboard sequence for opening test mode
none of the menu options drop with alt

Gonna debug this Saturday FYI. Its likely something in a5_keyboard.c

ALT+ENTER works (see `onEnter`). Where is the code that handles the menu bar shortcuts?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/25/2022 20:29

gui.c menu_alt_key

...oh. this is in jwin.cpp :/

got a lead. allegro legacy is emulating key events wrong: https://www.allegro.cc/manual/4/api/keyboard-routines/readkey#:~:text=Pressing%20alt%2Bkey%20returns%20only%20the%20scancode%2C%20with%20a%20zero%20ASCII%20code%20in%20the%20low%20byte.

pushed a fix. also filed an issue upstream https://github.com/NewCreature/Allegro-Legacy/issues/27
