Best example I can give is New Quest 2013 to converted versions of New Quest 2022 converted from A 109 to A 111.
These first two work correctly (collect the Boomerang and kill the Keese in the first room)

This one works incorrectly (Alpha 111)

If this isn't spotted by the time I get back I will make videos showing it
If I'm a complete bonehead let me know too

It's been a few days, how far down the queue is this bug for fixing?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 11:58

Is the issue it being saved in the new version or played in the new version?
If saved, did you say yes to the bugfix popup?

=== @ NightmareJames 12/04/2022 15:41

I'll make a new conversion and let you in know

=== @ NightmareJames 12/04/2022 17:51

The new conversion worked better, going to go check the rules

=== @ NightmareJames 12/04/2022 18:03

IDK, this is driving me INSANE

=== @ NightmareJames 12/04/2022 18:06

I found the problem
IT deals with "BS-Zelda Animation Quirks"
IDK if it's a bug or not
Honestly

=== @ NightmareJames 12/04/2022 18:08

If "BS-Zelda Animation Quirks" is required for swapping out characters, this could be a bigger issue, I'm not terribly sure though

=== @ NightmareJames 12/04/2022 18:16

Anyway Emily, regardless of how this turns out, want to thank you for the rule searches and the rule helps (the "?"'s).  It's making finding stuff like this much eassier

...if you change a QR, that changes behaviors

=== @ NightmareJames 12/04/2022 18:27

I don't know if this is going to affect anyone else, might be something to watch.  Anyway, thank you for helping me

It's a good thing I keep backups.  üôÇ
