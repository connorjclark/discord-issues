The new one is very annoying. I would like it if the keyboard cursor automatically was in the number picker because before I could just open the "scroll to combo page" dialog, type a number, and click enter. Now I have tomanually click on the number box and then type my number in and also click the OK button (enter doesn't work????). Needless friction.

I have not updated to a version with this but I completely agree. Old one is perfect, no reason to change

Seconding (Thirding). This seems like it makes the process much more tedious

üëç heard loud and clear. Not reverting to the old one, because that's the wrong answer; but changing the things you mentioned about the new one.
(Was changed for backend cleanup reasons; this is new gui system, so)

Had to fix a bug with focusing to allow focusing the textfield properly! That said, changes:
- The textfield starts focused
- Enter hits the OK button automatically
