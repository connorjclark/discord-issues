The idea just now occurred to me, why are still using two to four checkboxes in QR to determine the amount of triforce pieces in a quest? I believe it would be better to have as a typeable number count for triforce pieces in a manner similiar to how map count is now handled. Heck it can even be moved to the same tab that mapcount and the like now call home.

It would certainly around more options in quest making, such as a quest that require 12 or even 16 triforce pieces!

Or even multiple McGuffin sets. LttP, LbtW, Twilight Princess etc...

This would also go good with a Catch All in Triforce Check rooms
With an option to require all pieces up to the specified #, or only a certain amount of pieces equal to the specified #
Like a need 1st 4 triforce pieces room, or need any 4 triforce pieces room

Though I would accept a scripted solution

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/05/2021 23:21

Why limit it to eight and therefore lock out the possibility of having more than eight triforce pieces/macguffins?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 23:23

There are only 8 bits in init data allocated to storing those
so if I want to expand that, I actually have to expand init data
which currently would break changes Dimi is trying to make with sideview water

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/06/2021 00:00

I see...

=== @ P-Tux7 10/06/2021 02:24

again a scripted array would be so much easier
and you wouldn't need to care about init data as you wouldn't start with anything

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/06/2021 14:38

the script needed for this is so simple that internal handling  is super extraneous for the limited number of games that would use it imo

=== @ FireSeraphim 07/22/2022 09:44

I kinda need this now, especially since I have more than eight triforce pieces

(meta) thread name was changed: ❌Better Quest Triforce count handling
