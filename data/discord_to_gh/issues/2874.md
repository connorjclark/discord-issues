This would be a button that activates after you follow a warp. When selected, it would automatically set up all the parameters for a warp back to the screen you were previously viewing.

My god this would be the most useful thing.  D:  I love it.

This menu should definitely be improved. Maybe instead of right click (which is hidden) a checkbox for "Configure reverse warp" that would do the same thing

For side warps this would also have to set the warp for the appropriate screen edge too

after warping, this stays in your menu. Using it warps you to where you came from- and sets the screen you used IT on as the new warp back spot, so you can swap back and forth.

also sets for sidewarps, and the `Goto` button in the Warp Ring dialog.
