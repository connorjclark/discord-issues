As the title suggests, sometimes when I open Zquest it keeps reverting my edit to the vanilla items, such as reverting the percentile on sword beams and reverting the length of the level 1 hookshot and the fact that I have to go in and fix that almost every time I fire up Zquest is annoying.

errrr??
Do you have any information other than "Sometimes when I open ZQuest"?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/05/2022 09:28

Don't quote me on this one but I think it also happens when I update the build of ZC or load another quest in zquest while devving

I can confirm it also affects custom enemies, it keeps reverting the custom pain sound of my custom hell knights, pinky demons and baron of hell back to the vanilla pain sound

err . . . what????

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/11/2022 09:15

Can confirm it still persists in the latest build for items at least

I really need more information than that
just "sometimes reverting some things" is waaaay too vague
Are you perhaps loading an autosave instead of a normal quest file?

(meta) thread name was changed: ❓ZQuest keeps reverting my edits to the default items
