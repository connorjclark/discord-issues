i have the feather assigned to use the L button and when i drown in water im still able to jump while drowning.

Holding down the button appears to let you just jump across water too lol

=== @ Jennette ❣ 12/10/2022 06:13

hitting jump the frame before you drown also lets you avoid drowning with the feather

I'll look into it

....this probably has something to do with the `doJump` call that takes `passive = true` parameter
guessing it needed more checks than I gave it XD

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "I'll look into it"): Did you make any progress on this?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/30/2023 05:19

sorry, haven't v.v

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 12:59

So, the jumping while drowning, it just wasn't checking action there
....the jumping the frame before you drown works with the normal button too....

appears to be fixed
