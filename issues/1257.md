Putting these 4 items built into ZC will finally Complete the SNES section.

somaria - no
powder - maybe? not important
fire rod - already planned
magic cape - maybe?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/13/2021 21:49

Ok
Magic Cape is one of those items you cant forget.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 21:55

Magic Powder sounds like it'd be dead easy tbh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 21:55

It should just be a simple weapon spawn

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 21:55

It's just a hitbox that's in front of you for a second
yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 21:55

but it needs a new enemy defense
and triggers

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 21:56

Cane of Somaria; fuck I want to do that so much

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 21:56

(frankly, I'll add new 'Secret Combos' / placed trigger flags for everything that needs them at once)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 21:56

I have no idea where I'd even start though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 21:57

It'd have to happen around the time I start working on solid frozen enemies/freeform solidity

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 21:59

Would it be a Weapon Type or a new Sprite Class though?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 22:00

If the former, it could damage enemies that it's pushed into
but then that goes into it being a weapon type that presumably could be created, unless it's given the same restrictions as melee weapons and just isn't allowed to be created
(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl "Cane Of Somaria  - Cane that‚Ä¶"): You're forgetting about the Ice Rod, which is already planned
and the Book of Mudora, which... hmm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 22:03

That might actually be really easy, if it's tied to signposts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 22:05

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "but then that goes into it be‚Ä¶"): why not create it
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "That might actually be really‚Ä¶"): SCCs can do this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 22:07

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "SCCs can do this"): They can, yeah
Though we do have an unused readingspr for link sprites
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "why not create it"): fair point...
Weapon->Solid as a variable might make sense
or, hell
Sprite->Solid
Just make it a Sprite thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 22:10

makes sense, not the best channel for this though

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/13/2021 22:31

I don't even remember what the Book of Mudora did.  All I remember it doing was Link holding it aloft in the southeast of the Light World in the desert, and a dungeon appeared or something.  The Whistle can do that now.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/13/2021 22:32

If you use it in front of certain signs, you can read them
It's like a String Control Code but  you need to actually *use* the item

=== @ Bagu 12/13/2021 22:32

What about a Re-/Deflect Attribute, for Swords, to crate real Agahnim - Mastersword "PingPong" Battles?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/13/2021 22:39

ü§¢
OK, so I'm going to close this thread, because it's a jumbled mess of ideas
If you want to *make separate threads for each idea*, that's fine
but everything is just gonna get buried in here
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) @ Bagu @ SkyLizardGirl @ Changeling

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 22:07

Would the Cane of Somaria be doable by creating a pushblock *on a layer*?
Now, granted, that would require not having layer 1/2 combos in spots where you can place or push a block - but you already have to make similar considerations when using layer 1/2 pushblocks

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/15/2021 22:12

It could be doable, but that seems less elegant honestly
ZC push blocks aren't great

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 22:28

mm
why i didn't make a new thread

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2021 08:00

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîíThese items are still missing from Zelda Classic
