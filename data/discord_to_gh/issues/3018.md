When i start test mode on certain screens, it doesn't scroll. It also makes all screens normal.

So it's only test mode eh?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/27/2024 01:11

This is working fine for me.

Are you sure you are loading the correct dmap

=== @ Majora 01/27/2024 01:24

Test mode tries to guess what dmap you want based on what palette is set for that dmap vs what palette the current screen is set to (via F4 menu)
so watch out for that if there's palette differences in this context

Just opened Z3 Build 15 and a 2x2 section of Region 1 scrolls for me. This is most likely a DMap selection error when initiating test mode. Barring further info.

Ahhh okay that must be why
Thanks Majora
The palette thing
