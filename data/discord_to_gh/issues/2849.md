=== @ Attempt 11/17/2023 10:22

Doesn't happen with all of them, ones i could find are the item editor and the init data menus, but there could be others i haven't found. but i found out that right clicking on the item editor list causes it to close after the "copy paste" options is closed

=== @ Attempt 11/17/2023 10:42

the init data just immediately closes after right clicking since there's no pop up for it

=== @ Attempt 11/23/2023 10:54

seems to happen pretty inconsistently over time
i can temorarily fix it by restarting ZC Editor

wait wait wait, Init Data is doing what now?
(replying to @ Attempt "the init data just immediatel…"): there isn't an rclick popup... which also means there's literally no rclick handler
...so that indicates the issue actually has nothing to do with the right-click handler itself, but actually has something to do with the list widget?

=== @ Attempt 11/23/2023 11:05

yeah, it's weird
even though there's no pop-up, r-clicking closes it along with the item editor widget

separate issue I noticed

...double right click is not supposed to count as a double click, as evidenced by this code
....but it is counting

....HAHAHAHA
and uh

....if the `D_USER` flag is set, then it closes the dialog after being clicked....
.....so uh
....oh, which is meant for *dropdown menus specifically*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2023 11:13

....I have no idea in what circumstance it would be possible for the `D_USER` flag to be set for those listers
because like, it shouldn't be, and it's very inconsistent to happen
but @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) I suspect this is the culprit of this long-standing bug, somehow
something must somehow be setting the D_USER flag for the lister

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2023 11:16

notably the other constants `D_READONLY` and `D_NOCLICK` share the value of `D_USER`
...`D_READONLY` which could theoretically be set for ANY new gui widget via `readonly = true`....
this is definitely sussy but I still don't see an actual cause of the D_USER flag getting set
