Starting in Alpha 100, during the very first opening wipe after starting ZC some extra pixels are drawn. Upon closer look, they appear to be based off of misc colors. They disappear as soon as the opening wipe ends and will not be drawn again until you close and reopen ZC.

This showcases said lines of pixels. Note there are some in the top left too.

I have noticed these too, but I didn't report them because I thought they were there for some sort of debugging purposes

Kinda curious if this is a leftover debug thing.
I'm only reporting this here so it doesn't get buried in other channels.

hmmm

this doesn't appear to be from any debug thing

...yep, found it
So, you know how I added light beam puzzles that do stuff with mirrors and stuff?
Well, those have their own global bitmap that is used for them
.....and it, uh, wasn't being cleared soon enough, so during the opening wipe, it was drawing random memory onto the screen
