It might be a problem even if you select that as the New animation, come to think of it

@ Moosh

=== @ P-Tux7 04/11/2022 16:29

If you're uninterested in waiting for a bugfix I can copy them to the New Enemy Tiles Manhandla format when I do the Super Manhandla
This is more @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) thing

=== @ NightmareJames 04/11/2022 16:30

Discuss New Tile stuff in the 3rdEX thread please (sorry, bad mod here, but this is only for the bug)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/11/2022 16:32

ooof

=== @ NightmareJames 04/11/2022 16:34

Bug or no bug DeeDee?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/11/2022 16:36

unsure; the whole point of old animation style is to replicate NES-quests, but uh;
I guess I could make a new QR for it

=== @ NightmareJames 04/11/2022 16:37

Would Enemy Flag be better?

=== @ P-Tux7 04/11/2022 16:38

enemy flags are limited; QRs are not
also generally the questmaker would want this bug fixed for all Manhandlas so it being a per-Manhandla flag would be pointless

=== @ P-Tux7 04/11/2022 16:45

oh turns out this isn't quite a bug
"Manhandla" is the same animation style for both Old and New enemy tiles; it all depends on the QR
so unless you want to go through the undertaking of doing that for EVERY hardcoded animation (Moldorm, Aquamentus, Gleeok, Digdogger, Manhandla) I think I'll just convert 3rdEX to New Enemy Tiles
i guess you COULD call that a bug but like... blegh

=== @ NightmareJames 04/11/2022 16:46

Yeah, I just think we're just going to convert and save the devs some work and add this to documentation

=== @ P-Tux7 04/13/2022 03:55

i do think this counts as a bug though, the hands not using the four tiles before the core
@ vlamart word of warning for your "blank quest" thing

=== @ vlamart 04/13/2022 04:02

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "@ vlamart word of…"): Thank you! The "blank quest" was mostly to help find all these hardcoded things anyways. Though I've taken a break from that for now to work on my own quest, which this is still helpful
