An item that allows the player to roll like in Minish Cap. Only available in Newer Player Movement. This also needs 4 rolling sprites and a rolling player state.

Flags:
-Invincible While Rolling - if checked, the player cannot be hurt while rolling
-Can Change Direction - If checked, the player can change direction while rolling. If not, the player is locked into their current movement direction for the duration of the roll.
-Diagonal Rolling - if checked, the player can roll diagonally if they are moving diagonally and roll. If not, they roll in the cardinal direction that they are facing.

Attributes:
-Roll Speed - How fast the player moves
-Roll Length - How long the
-Cooldown - How many frames the player cannot roll after rolling
(Might be neat to have bonk attributes after the bonk state is added for Pegasus Boots)

Not happening this version. If Pegasus Boots happen that'll be fancy enough. (Not saying never, just, don't want to add this to the list right now...)

It turns out that the person who had the idea for this changed their mind, so I think this can safely be set as low-priority.
