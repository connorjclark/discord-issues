In 2.55 versions, the Wooden Arrow acts like Bombs, disappearing from the subscreen when you have no ammo. When you fire the last Arrow from the bow, the Arrow Item is not rendered "unavailable" until screen transition or picking up an item.

Reading a prior bug when this occurred with Bombs, the issue is FlushItemCache is not being called to update this "unavailable Arrow" state.

Thinking about it, there is a concern that decrementing the Arrow counter via script will also not call this if it drops the Arrow Ammo count to 0.
