Unless this is already implemented somehow and I am unaware, it would be nice if when you press esc in the tile editor while you have something selected (e.g. hookshot tool) that it would deselect everything rather than exit the tile editor. 

If nothing is selected then pressing esc should work the same as usual.

Is this a suggestion because "D" to deselect is either unknown or doesn't work, or because Escape is more familiar by instinct?

Interestingly
if you have a FLOATING selection
escape IS the key to unfloat it
...but not to deselect a normal selection.

ok, added, easy
So the order is
if you have a FLOATING selection
esc will unfloat it
if you have a NON-FLOATING selection
esc will deselect
otherwise esc closes

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Is this a suggestion because…"): Imma be real I just didn't know that existed, altho I stand by that esc makes a bit more sense. Internal consistency.
Thank you emily!
