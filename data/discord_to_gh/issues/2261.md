1. An SCC to write to a LevelState (Level#|State#|Value of 0/1)
2. A string to read from a LevelState, and if the outlined value of 0/1 is met, go to string X (Level#|State#|Value|String#)
3. An SCC to write to a GlobalState (State#|Value)
4. An SCC to read from a GlobalState, and if the condution is met, go to string X (State#|Value|String#)
5. An SCC to write to an ExState (State#|Value)
6. An SCC to read from a ExState, and if the condution is met, go to string X (State#|Value|String#)

`LevelState` `GlobalState` and `ExState` are 3 separate things

=== @ P-Tux7 03/28/2023 20:28

I thought the first two were encompassed by the third being the catchall term for them... I have a lot to learn

`ExState` is the 32 extra *PER-SCREEN* states I added for lockblocks/chests
`LevelState` is the 32 togglable bits *PER-DMAP-LEVEL* used for crystal switches
`GlobalState` is the 256 togglable (or timerable!) *GLOBAL* states used for crystal switches

(DW, setting the timer would be done by putting a positive value into the second argument of the third SCC)

(meta) thread name was changed: Ex-Level-GlobalState SCCs

```cpp
\?1\Level\LState#\0 or 1 //Set the level state of a level. (Use '-1' for current level? does -1 work in SCCs?)
\?2\Level\LState#\String# //If level state is ON, goto string

\?3\GState#\Val (-1 or higher) //Set a global state. '-1' for 'on permanantly', positive value for timed.
\?4\GState#\String# //If global state is ON, goto string

\?5\ExState#\0 or 1 //Set the current screen's ExState
\?6\map\screen\ExState#\0 or 1 //Set another screen's ExState
\?7\ExState#\String# //Goto string if current screen's ExState
\?8\map\screen\ExState#\String# //Goto string if another screen's ExState```
I think this would be the way to add this?

perfect! and yes, negative numbers do work
```\18\dmap\screen\x\y\effect\sound - Warps Link to a specific dmap, and screen, at coordinates x, y.

If x is negative, y is used for the warp return point (0 to 3; 5 for pit warp).
    Valid effects: 
        0 == none, 1 == Zap, 2 == Wave, 4 == Mosaic, 5 == Opening Wipe
    If sound arg is a valid sound effect, then ZC will play that sound during the transition.```

Does that actually work properly?
I'm frankly surprised if so, this shit is janky AF
but also I've worked multiple magics on it in the past, so I guess trust past me?
but yeah, that'd be the way to handle adding this
the ExState ones mirror the normal screen state ones
and the level/global state ones are then as simple as possible
Notably you can't check how long is left on a timer with this, but nothing else generally does that either, most things just care if it's active or not
