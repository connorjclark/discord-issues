Say you have two swords. One is level 1, damage 100. One is level 2, damage 300. Equip and swing the first sword. It'll deal 300 damage, despite being set to only deal 100. I know this bug has existed in the past. Is there any reason it seems to keep popping back up?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 07:21

What recent build did this not occur in?

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 14:50

I don't recall seeing this occur in... 109?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 16:45

....this didn't occur in 109?
because from what I can see, I would expect this to occur in 2.50.2 and all versions after

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:46

I don't think? I'm not positive. I haven't messed around with new builds much since 107
I can confirm it doesn't happen in 107 though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 16:46

Really?
....oh, wait, it's conditional
So, make sure the sword lweapon *dies* to something
the engine respawns it, right?
...when it respawns it, it uses the highest level sword's damage.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 16:48

I would expect this to be the case in 2.50.2 frankly, as I doubt this code has been touched

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:49

... I would check except suddenly ZC isn't launching at all. I suspect Connor's test build didn't close properly
And I can't reset my PC at the moment

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 16:50

task manager won't let you close it?

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:50

Oh, there it is. Good call

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 16:50

If task manager doesn't show it, there's also command prompt ```taskkill /F /IM "zelda.exe"```

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:51

Yeah, this bug doesn't seem to be occurring in 107
I think I may be seeing another bug on top of it though...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 16:52

that confuses me
but I'm going to ignore that piece of evidence
and see if what I thought would work will work anyway

Magic @ Russ ?

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:56

That did fix it, yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 16:57

See
....there's a function
that gets the current melee weapon damage
and it just
sets the weapon to the highest level item of that class's damage
yes it was that blatantly obvious

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:57

Very weirded out why it works fine on 107 if this bug has been around since 2.5
But if it works, don't complain, I guess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 16:57

again
if you swing a sword
it would have the correct damage
until the engine found that the sword weapon was *missing*
at which point it creates a new one
and uses that to set the damage

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:58

So did the way swords work change between 107 and 110 that would cause the sword weapon to g missing more frequently?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 16:58

so, I would expect this to only have occurred in such a situation- perhaps hitting 2 enemies at once?
not that I'm aware of

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:59

No, it occurred hitting literally any enemy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 16:59

.....that confuses the fuck out of me
and makes absolutely no sense
whatsoever

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:59

Only thing I can imagine is that something in newer builds causes swords to be prematurely destroyed and recreated

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 17:01

If we want to know, I could bisect. Need a qst file, and the dmap and screen to quickly repro.
Are you logging the damage output or something?
or just know based on something else

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 17:02

We have a damage numbers script

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 17:02

gotcha

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 17:02

Deedee sent the quest file to you last night, right? Or was that to Emily?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 17:03

wasn't me

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 17:03

yeah i got it

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 17:05

Okay, so easiest way to see it would be. Go to dmap 0, screen 05. There's several octos wandering around. Hit them with the sword you start with. It should deal 200 damage. Now, turn on cheats. Give yourself the sword weapon "Sword 2 (Siyed)". Hit an octo with the same sword you hit it with before. It'll now deal 600 damage.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 17:13

coolio

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:20

starting bisect. it was good in 108

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:32

    Items can now be immune to jinx, or use the other type of jinx (flags)
```
mystery solved

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:32

. . . . Really????
What the fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:34

....oh
........I see
yep
that'd be my fault
well, my fix still works there so, all good
