If you get a Heart-eating Walking Enemy on you, it keeps interrupting your attempts to attack because it hurts you and is almost impossible to escape. Please make a QR where it's more like magic where it just passively drains the hearts but without knocking Link back.

Wait, heart-eating as in, heart _containers?_  Or your general HP?

shouldn't this be an enemy flag? Is knockback not already configurable?

=== @ P-Tux7 05/18/2023 18:44

*nope*
(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Wait, heart-eating as in, hea…"): Yeah, just HP. I have no idea what happens if you set non-equipment items to be edible, but probably nothing
(meta) thread name was changed: QR - Life-Eating Enemies Don't Cause Knockback

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Yeah, just HP. I have no idea…"): nothing, if an item is not an equipment item then you never have it for it to be eaten
