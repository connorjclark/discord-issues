just working on some stuff
so, uh, that preview? That's a fully animated preview that accounts for everything, including A.Skips and CSet2.
Also, you can *click off*- clicking on a tabpanel or the window itself will steal the focus away from textfields now
useful when you have keyboard shortcuts in the dialog

pog?

`+`/`-`, both regular and numpad, will change the cset that is being previewed
I have `V`/`H` for flip, but they don't flip the solidity/cset2/effect squares yet; that's next
and still need to add r for rotate

thank god the combo editor is finally getting an update
the combo editor was an unreadable mess since 2.55 started development

You would think nothing here is fancy
except for the fact that it just started on that second tab
because I switched to that tab, closed the dialog, and re-opened it
and it remembered the previous tab
woo

How do y'all feel about *scrolling*?

`PgUp`/`PgDn`/`Home`/`End`/`Scrollwheel` all work to scroll the pane

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/28/2021 11:51

...Totally open to not using this design if it doesn't seem good to everyone, though
just, a good excuse to finally test out the scrollpane and make sure it works.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): Pog!?
so much pog

vc?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 11/28/2021 15:59

At least 99% of people have a scroll wheel, and at least easy access to PgUp/PgDown, and even Home/End.  If it remembers the same position as where it left after hitting Escape or Enter, it's probably the best thing to do.
Looking fantastic, Emily! <:NPCNurseThumbsUp:573570441697034281>

OK, so item editor now also remembers tab selection

combo editor seems done as well

=== @ Alucard648 11/29/2021 05:42

Only 2 initDs? A full set of 8 initsDs is logical lere...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2021 05:45

Combo scripts have always had only 2
It takes a lot of space to add more to combos
