currently the lens can only hide/reveal one layer, possible to do mroe than 1?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/01/2023 03:49

bleh
. . . scripts probably have access to that value which would make changing it break old scripts
unless qrs
so it'd need a qr at least
....but, it wouldn't need more space, if they are ALL either hide or reveal
i.e. no hide layer 2 and reveal layer 3
....do you think that'd be ok?
(if not, then it would take an extra byte per screen, which, doesn't seem that bad?

=== @ P-Tux7 08/02/2023 18:57

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....but, it wouldn't need mor…"): could this be done via bitflags similar to shield blocking
i.e.
layer 1 = 1
layer 2 = 2
layer 3 = 4
layer 4 = 8

add them up to get a sum which you place in the attribute box

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/02/2023 18:58

why would you sum them manually lol
just do checkboxes

=== @ P-Tux7 08/02/2023 20:01

...has the shield GUI been rewritten to have that
i recall it still being like that in an earlier 2.55 version but maybe it got changed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/02/2023 20:09

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "...has the shield GUI been re…"): the item editor does not have a wizard system yet
which is required for different itemclasses to have different GUIs

Ohhhhh the ability to show and hide different layers!!
I have a few ideas I had to throw out since I couldnt do that
Awesome!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/08/2023 19:49

do note that this took rewriting the entire screen data dialog to make this sane to think about
lol
also it's locked on a compat rule because fuck dealing with compat shenanigans on this thing
Also do notice that layer 0 is listed
(You did also ask about pushblocks, that's not really... a layer... and I can't really do anything about that with the lens- BUT I have an idea to handle that, when I have the energy to get around to it)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/08/2023 22:39

@ Deathrider testable now.

=== @ P-Tux7 08/09/2023 03:43

(yeah pushblocks also have the sprite draw component)

=== @ Deathrider 08/12/2023 19:25

works, and is awesome
I also love the overhauled screen data menu

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 19:27

(replying to @ Deathrider "I also love the overhauled sc…"): Woo! <:hugheart:1012188325790089317>

=== @ Deathrider 08/12/2023 19:27

it will take some getting used to since muscle memory is different but it looks nicer

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 19:29

And the stupid `Script` option in the main `Screen` menu is gone

=== @ Deathrider 08/12/2023 19:29

oh also adding this lense system did undo all lense rooms already created

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 19:29

just part of screen data now
yeah, uh, the new system uses separate new variables
think of it like old vs new enemy tiles, separate things you have to set
but only one gets used depending on a qr

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 19:31

the dialog just autohides the currently unused one

=== @ Deathrider 08/12/2023 19:31

Ill just have to redo all rooms using the new system, not like I had too many so not a huge issue. Actually I may change some of those rooms now that I can show and hide layers at once

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 19:32

(If you want to toggle back and forth, you can toggle the qr from the `?` button on the lens thing)
(that reloads the dialog between the dropdown for the old value and the new checkboxes)

=== @ Deathrider 08/12/2023 19:32

oh so each screen can use old or new independently

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 19:32

no
it's just a shortcut to the quest rule so
it's a global toggle

=== @ Deathrider 08/12/2023 19:33

ok, I did notice the shortcut to the qr

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 19:33

but, if you need to read what a screen used to be set to so you know what to set it in the new system, you can easily toggle it back and forth

=== @ Deathrider 08/12/2023 19:33

which is also very nice
oh I see, that is nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/12/2023 19:34

that was the whole idea
Also, your script will want to update?
...I might add a couple small things that would be better for your script though (referring to the torch revealing one for the record)
so, we can look at updating that together at some point later
...a bit focused on the engine subscreen changes at the moment though
