https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2022-07-07

Windows x64 build

Used to be able to grab PNGs, not any more. 

Recolor can't figure it out either (but maybe there's something wrong with the GIF I exported)

overall the grabbing function appears to be crippled.

hero sprites are on tile page 40, was just trying to import the bottom row in the image (slashing sprites)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2022 17:05

do gifs or jpgs work?

=== @ Majora 07/07/2022 17:06

haven't tried jpgs
i'll grab screenshots one sec

This is definitely broken/anomalous behavior because I have changed nothing about how I import tiles. Used to be able to grab PNGs. Along with BMP and GIF, all 3 formats ZQ would make decent attempts to recolor (or rather the behavior was consistent, vs this off the rails stuff that screams broken, to me)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2022 17:18

it's just outright failing to load files?
That's odd

=== @ Majora 07/07/2022 17:19

yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2022 17:19

and the colors there....
it should grab the exact same way it appears in the preview
but it's just.... not

=== @ Majora 07/07/2022 17:19

yuuup, super weird

=== @ Majora 07/07/2022 17:21

I feel like maybe being 64-bit caused something to be misaligned. a similar sort of problem to that frame bug you fixed.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/07/2022 17:23

No. I know the issue. Will fix it tn.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/07/2022 17:23

Also, while you're at it

`.png` is not in the dropdown list of extensions
(not a new issue, it just, was never added)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 03:31

png for 64 bit is difficult because we are using precompiled binary for libpng that is quite old. Newest libpng is somewhat easy to build but the allegro png addon we are using doesnt work with it. And I could not get the older libpng to build for 64 bits.
I poked at it a bit but didn't get very far. So for now, no png in 64 bit üò¶

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 03:34

I have another approach that would be better: use allegro 5's native handling of png and drop the special a4 library that does png. Will try some other time.

=== @ Majora 07/08/2022 03:52

dang, well that's fine. as long as the recoloring function works properly again, format isn't too too important.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 04:02

Can you make a video showing how recoloring should look for one or two different formats? and provide me the images
so i have something to compare it to

=== @ Majora 07/08/2022 04:04

yuh, I'll post them here

@ Majora anything new to report

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 04:06

tl;dr no 

oh fuck oh god, not yet. was gonna try grabbing random tiles off the DB to see if maybe i just fucked exporting mine or something. also need to make my sprite sheet use exactly 16 colors, but then very slightly change them all, to see if ZC actually CAN color match or if its just completely broken.
after I finish this guy's short quest i'll get on that

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 05:44

I definitely feel like the algorithm/function to match colors changed between allegro 4 and 5. but whatever, file this away. at least regular formats can load in (i.e. the BMP header bytes thing, and PNGs)

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 05:47

Trying this in alpha 107 (off the website/zeldaclassic.com, build date June 10th )
and then before that in a beta now that I think abotu it, I think allegro 5 was in 107

top pair of trees: Just grabbing. not pressing recolor
second pair of trees: with recolor

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 06:01

TL;DR: 

Left window is the build right before allegro 5 integration. Something changed between allegro 4 and 5 with how incoming colors are read/interpreted?

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 06:12

Currently pretty much the only way to import tiles is to manually externally forcibly set them to 16 colors and the exact same color values <:kekw:820115662089355296>

next nightly should fix this for good
