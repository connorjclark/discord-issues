Manually typing in any warp destination that isn't on row 0 is essentially impossible for tile warps, side warps, warp rings, etc. because ZQ always places a 0 as the first character when typing a screen ID. The field is limited to 2 characters, thus making it impossible to input any screens beyond row 0 with anything other than the map gizmo.

(replying to @ Phosphor "Manually typing in any warp d…"): this was just reported ( #2940 ), with the response being to update, because it was already fixed a week ago

=== @ Phosphor 12/31/2023 01:24

oh ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/31/2023 01:24

aye, lol
2 people reported this today
and both of them were using a 10-day-old build, thus missing the 7-day-old fix lol

I had been noticing it for way longer but I honestly assumed someone else would notice it an report it sooner

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/31/2023 01:26

I noticed it and fixed it a week before anyone reported it XD
and y'all STILL managed to report it on me lol
I try to swipe my stupid typos under the rug XD
