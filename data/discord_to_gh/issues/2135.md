Using the nightly from 2023-01-10(?)

Enhanced mp3 music does not loop. After track runs its course it will remain silent, including when warping to a DMap that uses the same Enhanced music track. Going to one with a different track will start that playing.

Win7, 64bit.

Can you provide the mp3
Did it work in a recent alpha

Was using literally the most recent build on the server at the time of making this thread: https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876906918847852594/1062492327878336522

I'm asking if it worked in a recent alpha, not a recent nightly. We need to know when it broke. Please review the bug report submission guidelines.

Oh, duh. MP3 in ZC doesn't support loops.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2023 03:25

oh you aren't talking about loops within a mp3, but that when it gets to the end it never restarts

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/13/2023 03:40

should be fixed for next nightly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/21/2023 03:37

@ Lunaria can you confirm?

=== @ Mani Kanina 02/21/2023 06:09

Not any time soon, sorry. My life is somewhat busy atm.

Marking as resolved, if you find otherwise let us know.
