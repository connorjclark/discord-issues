Ever since Alpha 107, extending until the latest version, opening a quest saved in a version less than that (2.53 and less at the very least, all the way down to 1.90) sets its "book fire" sound to the same sound as the wand magic. Since sound effects are not stored in 1.90 quests I presume there is something going on in the player/interpreter code that makes it play the wand magic sound by default in these situations when it should be playing the flame sound. This does NOT happen when playing any quests in the interpreter that were saved in 1.90-2.53, but ONLY after you save them in 2.55.

I opted to not use "new bugfixes", but I figured that not enabling them would result in the quest playing identically to its 1.90/2.50 version after being saved in 2.55. If the issue is that I didn't turn them on, it might be worth making it clearer in the bugfix dialogue that setting "new bugfixes detected" to ON does not change how the quest plays and retains the gameplay of the earlier ZC player version.

Since this happens since Alpha 107, the switch to Allegro 5 is not implicated in this bug.
