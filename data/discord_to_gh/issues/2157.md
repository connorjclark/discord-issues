I'm running in a disconcerting problem where when I try to hit the import, or even the recolour button in the tile importer, it flat up doesn't react or do anything. The only workaround I found is using the keyboard shotcuts in the tile importer. I suspect something broke in there. Probably some lines of code concerning GUI elements.

I think Emily's efforts on the font front might have had some unexpected consequences and is probably affecting the tile importer in the tiles menu

oop, yeah, that seems like a problem
hardcoded bullshit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/04/2023 22:12

(For now you could probably grab into an older build, and export using `File->Export->Graphics->Tile Pack`?)
will look into this next

I'm talking about this:

yeah, aye
I know
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "(For now you could probably g…"): this is a different way that avoids you needing that dialog
you can't import images that way, but if you import images into an older build, you can export them from that build as a tile pack, and the import them in the current build
....if you really need it, before I get around to fixing this, that is
just offering a workaround

=== @ FireSeraphim 02/04/2023 22:15

Did I mentioned that keyboard shotcuts in that menu still seem to work?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/04/2023 22:15

If those work for what you need then that works fine
(I myself wouldn't be able to use it from that, it doesn't *list* the keyboard shortcuts anywhere)

=== @ FireSeraphim 02/04/2023 22:17

Well here's hoping it's doesn't turn out to be a nightmare of spaghetti code  for you and your team to fix.

I love hardcoded screen coordinates
they are so fun

Yeah, those hitboxes seem just a tad off

Ahk
fixed completely, all buttons, even the tiny X in the corner
for compact, large, and small
