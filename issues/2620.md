two requests for subscreen stuff (god damn this is so much more modular and *FUN*)
- would it be possible to have an adjustable selector offset or something? like, something that expands the selector frame around a widget by however many pixels?
- tile block and text widgets don't have the selector showing around them when you select them

@ DeletedUser working on the first one. Are you sure about the second one? (Do you have the selector widget on a higher layer than the textbox/tileblock?)

=== @ tacochopper 08/30/2023 03:02

(replying to @ tacochopper "reposting https://discord.com…"): As you can see, this goes outside the bounds

=== @ tacochopper 08/30/2023 03:24

lol
looks good though!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/30/2023 04:11

ahk, so now
you can set it per-widget, with a direct EXACT x/y/w/h and graphical info
or per-active-subscreen in the settings, with OFFSET x/y/w/h and graphical info
(per-widget takes effect over per-subscreen)
and if neither are set it uses the normal item info

some of the ways the customization works
@ DeletedUser so this fits everything you wanted, you think?

=== @ tacochopper 08/30/2023 05:10

should make it look nicer
thank u
