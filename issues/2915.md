Went to change Gamepad Controls, hit "Clear" on EX4, ZC froze. When I reopened it and tried again, the exact same thing happened. Need Task Manager to close the window. Version is 3.0.0, December 15 nightly.

It makes no sense why, but it is waiting for key input.
ah, it should be showing something on the screen but isnt

```cpp
textout_centre_ex(gui_bmp, font, "Press any key to clear", gui_bmp->w/2, gui_bmp->h/2 - 8, jwin_pal[jcBOXFG],jwin_pal[jcBOX]);
    textout_centre_ex(gui_bmp, font, "ESC to cancel", gui_bmp->w/2, gui_bmp->h/2, jwin_pal[jcBOXFG],jwin_pal[jcBOX]);
```
so it's waiting for confirmation

ah, this has happened before lol
in fact I think this is why the `bool force` was added to `update_hw_screen` originally

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 03:16

fixed
it's not force, it's that we draw to wrong bitmap
obvious after comparing to the bit that does work, the same ui for clicking the button assign

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2023 03:17

ah lol
it was the force the last time this happened, years ago

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 03:17

(it also needed to use `force`, but already is)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2023 03:17

so yeah figured it wouldn't be this time

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 03:17

ok so its restored but
it's a stupid dialog

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2023 03:18

yeah lol this is old

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 03:18

I guess you are already using the mouse/keyboard to assing buttons
but the transfer between the controller and the mouse/keyb is annoying
anyhow, marking fixed, but one day this should all be improved

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 03:20

thanks for reporting @ Ether!

=== @ Ether 12/20/2023 03:21
