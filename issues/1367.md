An ability to limit the direction that statue shooters of any sort can actually detect the player.  I.e.  if Right-facing statues have an invisible internal line passing through that statue dividing the screen up and down where it can only detect the player if it's to the right of that line. 

Perhaps the new green "Effect" clickable quadrant squares can determine where that is?  So a full green square will detect the player anywhere, but a green square with only its bottom half green will detect the player only anywhere below it?

I think this should be enemy settings and you can just define an enemy for the statue to spawn

Even in a room where all ten enemy slots are occupied by other non-shooter enemies?
Where defeating the enemies could possibly turn off those statues via a flag of some sort?

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Even in a room where all ten…"): Yeah, the *combo* would spawn the enemy as it does with normal shooting statues, it wouldn't be in an enemy slot
(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "Where defeating the enemies c…"): And I have actually requested this too as a screen flag
