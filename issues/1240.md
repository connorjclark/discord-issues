Currently I think the candle allows 2 fires onscreen at once. Could this number be adjusted in the item editor to create more / less fire?

Sooooo
Max number of fire weapons onscreen at once
and also, `Once Per Screen` is now `Limited Per Screen`
able to set a max limit per screen
so you could, say, make a candle that can be used 5 times max per screen

also, if you had multiple candles that were once per screen before, it was once TOTAL, not once EACH
that's no longer the case, on a rule
