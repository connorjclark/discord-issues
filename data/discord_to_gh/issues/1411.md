Right in the title. I know there's a script to have each string be different, but it'd be nice if it was built in! Doesn't seem too complicated.

I mean
it would require adding multiple pickup strings to EVERY ITEM
so, kinda wasting space for bloat

Can SCCs check how many POHs you have and branch to a suitable string accordingly?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/20/2022 03:42

With the new character limits, I'd imagine that "If POH = 0 go to string A, else if POH = 3 go to string B, else if POH = 2 go to string C, else if POH = 1 go to string D" would be very feasible

. . . . no, thanks for adding another idea to my plate XD

=== @ P-Tux7 02/20/2022 03:42

Sorry, but luckily that should make this possible without any bloat

I figured it’d be easier lol. Why not just add it to heart piece items?
I mean I’m 100% okay with using the script in the database, even though it does a weird thing with the sfx

(replying to @ Jared "I figured it’d be easier lol.…"): that's.... not a thing that CAN be done
unless it used one of the *attributes*
which, eh
I guess that could work
but blehg
having something not use it's pickup string in one specific edge case seems kinda janky
#1412 is far cleaner
