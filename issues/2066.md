Getting inconsistent UID's from the same weapon when tracing them from different script scopes.  See the example quest and setup:
```#include "std.zh"

eweapon script testUID {
    void run() {    
        Trace(this->UID);
    }
}

global script active{
    void run() {
        while(true) {
            if (Hero->HitBy[HIT_BY_EWEAPON_UID]) Trace(Hero->HitBy[HIT_BY_EWEAPON_UID]);
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```

The eweapon script traces what it thinks the weapon UID is when it's created.  The active script traces the UID of weapons that hit Link when they hit him
Setting up a test screen with one octorok firing a weapon with this script...

You get this output:

As you can see, the UID's from fire/hit don't match

I *believe* that the weapon script is the one that's wrong, based on where I found this in the main quest I'm working on.  I was seeing things like this in the output:
http://puu.sh/Jtowc/06678888af.png
Where the script created UID message is obviously not matching what the weapon is tracing.

What happens, out of curiosity, when you `Trace(this))`?

=== @ mitchfork 12/06/2022 14:01

Looks like `Trace(this)` is correct

I wasn't aware that UID was supposed to match the pointer values
but that makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:06

`->UID` is a script-access UID, not the internal UID
it isn't *meant* to match the game event trace
....Zoria's design, if you have any complaints.

=== @ mitchfork 12/06/2022 14:07

it just coincidentally matches it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:07

err, it doesn't
(replying to @ mitchfork "http://puu.sh/Jtowc/06678888a…"): ^ this I mean

=== @ mitchfork 12/06/2022 14:08

oh I see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:08

the internal UID, which is what the event log is tracing, is what's used for the pointer values

=== @ mitchfork 12/06/2022 14:09

so then what's really happening is that `->UID` is getting a script-access value, and `->HitBy[HIT_BY_EWEAPON_UID]` is getting the internal one?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:09

...yep

=== @ mitchfork 12/06/2022 14:10

thank you Zoria
very cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:10

`HIT_BY_EWEAPON_PTR` might be a better name for that constant
because you should be able to compare it directly to the `eweapon` var
i.e. `Hero->HitBy[] == this` in the eweapon script or somesuch

=== @ mitchfork 12/06/2022 14:11

yeah, makes sense, and that's functional in the way I need it to be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:11

hitby is `untyped`, so that comparison is allowed

=== @ mitchfork 12/06/2022 14:13

yeah, would definitely say that updating the constant name/zscript docs would be helpful then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:14

...for fucks
Also apparently `->UID` is *read/write*
because good job zoria

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:15

the only thing I see `->UID` doing is `Screen->LoadEWeaponByUID()`
but I really don't see why *any* of this is even useful?
you can just use the fucking pointers
like HitBy does
that's already a fucking unique ID

=== @ mitchfork 12/06/2022 14:17

I don't think I use it at all, but not sure about other scripters
This is the only time I wanted to and it turns out it's not necessary lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:21

I'm just undocumenting those

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:25

👍 constants renamed, the confusing UID stuff removed from documentation and marked deprecated
(Next build will have a compiler setting allowing you to get either warnings or errors on using 'deprecated' internal functions/vars, which will basically warn you when you're using outdated stuff that shouldn't be used anymore. It's off by default, because, well, compat.)

=== @ mitchfork 12/06/2022 14:27

makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/06/2022 14:27

Depending on the function/var, the warning/error might also include information
like `Input->ReadKey[]`, which tells you:
`Use '->KeyPress[]' instead!`
