Might be as crazy and ambitious as Generic, but a general pushblock type that puts all block properties in one place. Such as flags for: wait, heavy (attribute - level), once, 4-way or specific direction (attribute - directions); if it can be pushed into liquid/pits (falling sprite), over liquid/pits (draws undercombo over liquid/pits), or no pushing (this could also be conditions for an "ice block" flag (attribute - accel/step)); use screen undercombo or specific (attribute) undercombo flag, and a block trigger/hole on all layers or same layer flag
Ooooh, if it can hurt enemies too!

If shutter is a state, then a block->state attribute (would be neat for multiple blocks on the same screen open a specific shutter)
