Some things I need to do first:

- Clean up / commit my quest database collection scripts to main repo
- Solve the problem of quest updating/versioning (or decide not to?)
- Grab more enhanced music (this is a manual process for me)

As far as the integration goes, the very simplest approach is for PZC quest pages to display a link like: `https://hoten.cc/zc/play/?purezc=questid`, and the browser version will know how to resolve that to the correct `.qst` file in its copy of the database. This is problematic for quest submissions that have multiple `.qst` files.

Some questions for @ Russ: 

1. Are you able to add a link like the one described above? If not or can't find the time, would you be able to give me access?
2. I'm currently scraping the web pages to get information such as: quest name, author, description, images, etc. I'm wondering if there is a structured format that quest data is stored in on the server. It would be much nicer if I could get at that data somehow - for example, I could provide a PHP script (or whatever) that iterates all the quest data and spits out JSON for everything. It would be much less error prone than what I'm doing.
3. The only way to solve the "quest submissions have multiple `qst` files" problem mentioned above, is if PZC has some knowledge of the qst file names in the uploaded submission. I doubt that exists already, as you probably just have an opaque zip file for each submission. I'd be able to create a PHP script (or whatever y'all are using...) to look inside those archives and extract the names of all the files, which could be both be displayed on a quest page but also used to give better links like `?purezc=1/SomeGame.qst`, which makes the request to the browser version not ambiguous.

1. I could probably add that link easily enough.
2. Probably, but not immediately. David and I have been talking about the site's future, since it's pretty old and needs an update, and our long term plans include rewriting it. When that happens, it'd be easy enough to integrate 
3. As of now, I don't believe we have any way of seeing multiple qst files inside a zip

As for the problem of quest updating, I think this is definitely important since a lot of recent quests have been on an update schedule of sorts. Using Yuurand as the prototypical example, it had 7 major updates that each added basically a full quest's worth of new content. Other quests update frequently to fix critical bugs and stuff, and having the browser version miss those would make the browser version just feel like the inferior way to play.

The main issue with updating is I feel I need to keep the old versions around, as sav files would otherwise be inoperable. But also, you'd want to possibly update your browser sav file to a new quest, for cases where it is a non breaking bug fix... My understanding is that the version field in the quest format could automate this decision but that it isn't well used
So it probably amounts to me writing custom dialog code in the title screen to prompt the user to update if they want...
(and probably to downgrade too!)

Oh boy!

Anyway, most of this is just me thinking how to make it less hacky moving forward. The minimum we need is that link I mentioned first. And just be ok with browser just selecting the first qst in it's database in cases of multiple existing
But should def solve the updating problem before launching this
...I also wanted to tackle the problem of ZQ using SO MANY threads, which are expensive in browser. I think we use 20+
For dumb stuff like "run this single one line function in a timer"

Just updated my database scraping script to fully automate download external music from any hosting provider. google drive was a journey.

All together, it's 6.8 GB. ~0.5 GB is duplicated files (kinda interesting).
