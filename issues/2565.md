In short, a function in zScript that writes to gamedata->guys[] to reset all enemy respawns to 0 of a map, similar to how taking an Entrance / Exit warp does this. Possibly make it where if mapNum is -1 it clears all maps.

as `Game->ResetEnemies(int map = -1, int scr = -1);` it could also do individual screens

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/02/2023 23:13

Since this can be done with existing zscript, can we just add a method to std?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/02/2023 23:20

wait, can this be done with existing zscript?
oh
ffs
it can
oh, no it can't
it can only be done for the CURRENT MAP
using existing zscript

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/02/2023 23:34

There is `Game->LoadMapData(int map, int scr)`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/02/2023 23:35

oh, mapdata Guy is not the same as the enemy count.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/02/2023 23:37

yeah `GAMEGUYCOUNT` needs a map variant

bump
@ Moosh wanna tackle this? It should be simple enough...

=== @ Moosh 10/11/2023 04:59

This would be basically adding a ->GuyCount to remote mapata? Or what?
A little busy right now but does seem easy enough. Actually didn't know guycount was remembered for more than the current map

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/11/2023 05:01

(replying to @ Moosh "This would be basically addin…"): yeah, basically
can probably look at `->State[]` for reference, I'm guessing it's similar

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/30/2023 11:19

`int Screen->GuyCount;`
`int mapdata->GuyCount;`
```
int GuyCount;
 * Number of enemies remaining alive on this screen.```
not quite a "reset whole map", but, gives you what you need to do that yourself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/30/2023 11:30

@ HeroOfFireZC should be able to test this in the next nightly
