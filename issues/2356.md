Similar to the hookshot/switchhook grab flag for any combo, also include flags for hookshot/switchhook over, ladder over, and jump over

...nope
at least, not any time soon, or by me
sounds painful

=== @ vlamart 05/01/2023 18:53

Fair enough haha

>jump over
so how would you handle standing on combos that you land on
i can't remember if jumping down from switch blocks is even implemented
so that is in essence an entirely new feature

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 21:37

jump over is called "use a pitfall"

We've had a Lynel quest, a Moblin quest, a Wizzrobe quest, two Zol quests, and three Darknut quests. And yet you, with shocking audacity and unmitigated gall, stand in the way of a Pols Voice quest with authentic block-hopping powers. We WILL be back for you after Goriya Quest.

Yeah, I was assuming for jumping over solids. Can you make solid pits you don't fall or pull into that you can jump over?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 22:05

err, nope. Jumping over solids sounds painful.
And useless
because like
what happens if you land in the solid
you just... jump again?
so you would just be jumping through an infinite distance of whatever this solid is.... only able to move while airborne?
that.... doesn't really make much sense.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "err, nope. Jumping over solid…"): you can jump over the solid if it's a switch block
but you still need to define the height needed to jump over it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/11/2023 23:54

yeah, right, forgot about that
everything to do with switch block height is jank jank mc hackery
I would know, I'm the one who jank mchackered it
