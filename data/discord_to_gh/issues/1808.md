an item on a conveyor on the bottom right of the screen isn't pushed by the conveyor.
I have no idea if it's the bottom row in general or not; the key is a fall from ceiling key

(checked in alpha 107)

i think the issue is that there simply is no conveyor combo below that one to push it further
if this DID work in 2.53, it needs to be moved to #deleted-channel

This did work in 2.53, yes. You could do some wacky nonsense with items being moved by conveyors while offscreen
Also AQ2 is a great testing ground for obscure 2.53 compatibility stuff because it does a whole lot of jank

=== @ P-Tux7 08/12/2022 21:11

(replying to @ Moosh "This did work in 2.53, yes. Y‚Ä¶"): Offscreen conveyor combos *worked*?
You'd think it wouldn't run any combo stuff on neighbouring screens besides animation and detections for swimming/smart scrolling solids to save RAM

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/14/2022 03:49

So I fixed the item not moving in the corner
but apparently AQ2 did some *wacky* shit with moving items almost offscreen to move them around blocks

=== @ P-Tux7 08/14/2022 05:07

How is that wacky?
An item on-screen should be moveable, right? It's certainly what you would hope happens in ZC when it comes to scripting moving items.
Though if you mean moved by off-screen conveyors then yeah that's wacky as I described above

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/14/2022 13:47

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Though if you mean moved by o‚Ä¶"): the wacky thing is that you can move the key offscreen and back onscreen

around these blocks
(not actual equipment you're meant to have; just cheating)

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Offscreen conveyor combos *wo‚Ä¶"): So is this seriously what's happening?
~~Oh, there's a funny idea, make an invincible enemy the ringleader and sit Link next to a KAE item, and the key is only reachable if you kill the enemy in one specific place~~

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/16/2022 01:38

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "So is this seriously what's h‚Ä¶"): okay so basically when items check for conveyors, they check combopos, which clamps x and y to screen bounds

=== @ P-Tux7 08/16/2022 01:39

mhm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/16/2022 01:39

this is intentional so that conveyors pushing items off the screen continue to push the item entirely off the screen despite the item only checking it's center
but I think what's happening here is that the effectflags check doesn't clamp to the screen, it just returns false if offscreen

=== @ P-Tux7 08/16/2022 01:41

mm
did this happen before the new screen stuff connor did or was that what broke it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/16/2022 01:59

It was my comboeffects stuff that broke it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/04/2022 03:01

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) did your 3a55574 commit fix this?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/04/2022 03:03

Yeah, I fixed both of these

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/04/2022 03:06

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíItems don't move on conveyors in corner
excellent
