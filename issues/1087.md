Complete the set. Even if some of the uses for this function are outdated, the functions themselves still have occasional uses. If I want to cycle items by some method except for the quest rule, there's just no convenient way to do that.

`SetItemSlot(int itm_id, int button, int force);` replaces al of the old stuff and is internal/fast.
```int SetItemSlot(int itm_id, int button, int force);                
 * This allows you to set Link's button items without binary operation with options for forcing them.
 * Use the constants ITM_REQUIRE_* and ITM_SLOT_* from <std> when passing values into this function. 
```

You also have direct r.w of `ItemA`, `ItemB` , `ItemX` a nd `ItemY`

Adding <std> ZASM would literally be far slower. What is the desired benefit?

imo those old functions are now useless and should be avoided rather than expanded and encouraged
