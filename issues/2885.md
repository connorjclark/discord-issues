Basically, the door combo set editor currently is a lot of busy work, especially if you're setting up more than one set.

You can alt + click to paste in whatever combo is selected in the combo editor, which at least takes you to the right page and CSet, but it's still a lot of busy work.

Ideally there would be a way to set up combos in a specific order or something and the wizard could just auto configure the entire set for you.
There *is* an Auto button already, but I'm honestly confused what it does.
(if anything)

I would also love to see something like this. I suffered making 14 door sets firsthand and it literally took multiple days to do them all
