Somewhere either in the combo page or near the combo selectors, add a little search bar. Can search by Combo ID, types, inherent flags, or labels

Now with colour blind stuff, search by colours too?

(replying to @ vlamart "Now with colour blind stuff,…"): god no, also that changes based on cset
(replying to @ vlamart "Somewhere either in the combo…"): bleh, this sounds annoying.... you have `RClick->Scroll to Page` to go to pages, which lets you basically get to any combo ID you want
what.... would the search *DO*?
like, what do you actually want from this? You need to give more details

It will reorder the combo page/selectors to list, say I typed "Liquid", to all liquid type combos in ID order

*hahahaha*....
I'm just gonna go with "No, I'm not rewriting the entirety of how combo columns work to handle sorting/filtering"
this is a stupid massive amount of work required

Fair enough. Then maybe add Labels to the combo tooltips? (When hovered over the combo selector or main screen editor, and only shows if label is not `NONE` or blank)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/23/2023 14:18

Added it to the tooltip, but only over the combo columns
(the tooltip over the main screen is far more crowded already and I don't really want to fuck with that right now)

(note that Inherent Flag also appears there, if it is non-0
