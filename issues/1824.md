In the title bar of the application (all 3), would it be possible to add the pixel size of the window. Not the window + bar/border, just what ZC/ZQ is displaying. Since they can be dynamically resized and all. To facilitate recording, was what I was thinking as basis for this.

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) this'd be you

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 06:51

no that's silly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 06:53

probably silly in the title bar, though displaying it somewhere might be nice

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 06:53

something by Video Mode

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 06:53

or, having a dialog that you can open to type in a specific w/h to resize the window to

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 06:53

is fine
also i am not gonna touch gui to do this so PEACE

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 06:54

where's the resizing code, what values are relevant?
i.e. how do read/write window width/height

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 06:55

he just wants the window size so
one sec

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 06:55

if you can explain that, I can probably handle that

=== @ Majora 08/21/2022 06:55

yeah like how you can resize the window to any size now, by clicking on the edges. I wanna know what the current size ZC/Q is displaying at.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 06:55

`al_get_display_width(_a5_display)`
is the window display size

=== @ Majora 08/21/2022 06:56

I know the application will always have an internal resolution ot 800x600 (i.e. ZQuest large mode) but being able to see how big the display currently is, would be nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 06:56

and is there an easy way to resize the window to an arbitrary w/h?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 06:56

https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/blob/3e20ca69332b818e8799746d7d1e3dfdf8e3afa5/src/zc/zelda.cpp#L5313-L5313
Yeah, see that same block of code linked above
al_resize_display

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 06:57

ugh

=== @ Majora 08/21/2022 06:57

I went with title bar because it seemed the least hassle, despite how inelegant it is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 06:57

there is literally `Etc->Video Mode`
....which currently just reports

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 06:58

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 06:58

```
Unknown...   ?
800x600 8-bit```

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 06:58

Yeah that's bogus
a4 has a concept of res/video mode
which is now a lie

=== @ Majora 08/21/2022 06:58

yeah but that'll always say 800x600 won't it, even if the window is physically like 1280x720 pixels

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 06:58

exactly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/21/2022 06:58

(so zelda really just has that 800x600 canvas)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 06:58

so that needs to be *fixed*, is the problem here
because it shouldn't be always reporting that
with that code block, I should be able to handle it

=== @ Majora 08/21/2022 06:59

sweeeeeet
connor go home

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 06:59

a new gui dialog to report the number, and allow changing it, should be dead-simple
as long as I have the ability to read/write the size

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 07:24

K, works nicely
can't show it off because still no internet, but, it works nicely

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 07:34

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅Display the current resolution of the program contents?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 07:54

I also included `1x`,`1.5x`,`2x`,`2.5x` buttons, which will fill the fields with that scale (of the base 800x600)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 08:06

oh uhhhh
I have a weird ass bug to report for you connor
...but I need to show a video, which, I can't post right now.... <:nkoSigh:585926650273988632>
