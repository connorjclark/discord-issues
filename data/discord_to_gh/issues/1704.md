The Entrance/Exit warp type no longer follows the arrival square, always spawning hero at (0, 0) instead

Do you know what version this first started?

can't reproduce
try the latest nightly https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2022-07-05

Must be quest specific or a mistake I'm making then, try a test on screen 3:63, and just walk up the stairs

Assuming the QR `Quest->Options->Combo->"Use Warp Return Points Only"` is off, if you're using an arrival square (green) instead of a return square (blue)?

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 00:10

It is off, and I am using the blue return point A

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 00:11

...if it is off, you should be using the green square, not the blue return point
as far as I understand

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 00:15

But wouldn't that assume it should have consistent behaviour between warp types? Because if I use insta-warp in Tile Warp settings, it warps to the correct blue square

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 00:22

I think it's a hardcoded feature of entrance/exit warps

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 00:23

This feels new because it worked before

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 00:26

Could it have something to do with warping to the same DMap (different screen of course)?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 00:32

<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>
you can check it in 2.50.2

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 00:37

I'll check it tomorrow

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 14:46

Oh, so the problem is using Entrance/Exit between two tile warps. It works correctly between a tile warp and side warp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 14:47

...? "Between two tile warps"?
A warp is a warp, what warp you have going the other way shouldn't affect it at all

It's strangely aware

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 14:51

Frankly, my advice is "don't use entrance/exit ever for any reason"

=== @ vlamart 07/06/2022 14:51

Agreed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2022 14:51

That's been what I've always done lol
The question is, is this behavior different from 2.50.2?
I wouldn't expect it to be
