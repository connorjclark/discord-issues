Some  suggestion for Stomp Boots items, basically to make it work more like the Downward Thrust attack (and Upward Thrust?) in Zelda II:

------ Multiple enemies fix:

0. Make the boots able to land on 2+ enemies at once without the player getting hurt. (QR or flag?)

------ Bounce:

1. "Bounce on enemies' heads" flag. When you land on an enemy, in addition to damaging them, Link gets a very small amount of jump (should prevent Link from getting hit, too). Maybe about jump = 1?

- 1b. As above, but also add a "bounce on enemies that block stomp boots" flag; bounce off an enemy which blocks stomp boots, without taking damage.

- 1c. As above, but "bounce on enemies that ignore stomp boots".

------ Mario-esque high bounce:

2. "Higher bounce when holding jump"; if you're holding the button for a roc item as you land on the enemy, you bounce higher. Maybe jump = 2? A settable number might be good if that's not a massive pain, but it sounds like a massive pain because GUI implementation.

------ Sword:

3. "Draw current sword when falling" flag. Link's current level of sword weapon is drawn, facing down, in front of Link as he falls (for up and down, it should overlap the Link sprite / the Link sprite should overlap it). No extra animation for Link is needed here unless you really want to get super fancy with it.

- 3b. "Require sword to use". If Link has no swords, these stomp boots won't work. 

- 3c. "Use sword defense type". The stomp boots check an enemy's sword vulnerability instead of stomp type.

------ Upward version:

4. "Stomp boots hit enemies above Link" flag. Enemies above Link's Z (and possibly like, Peahats?) take damage from these stomp boots. This would happen while jumping, instead of while falling. 

- 4b. "Stomp boots don't hit enemies below Link" flag. (If this flag is off, and the one from Suggestion 4 is on, then Link hits above while jumping, and below while falling)

- 4c. "Draw current sword when jumping" flag. This sword draw points up.

That first one sounds like a no brainer suggestion. Instantly gives the item better feedback overall

=== @ Mitsukara 04/30/2022 20:54

(meta) thread name was changed: Stomp Boots Features
(..."stop boots" lol)

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2022 20:54

I'm also not sure, does the item still have the janky property where you can stomp one enemy and get hit by another the same frame because it only puts the first into iframes? I recall that being a thing in older versions

=== @ Mitsukara 04/30/2022 20:55

Good question

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2022 20:55

It was very easy to just trade hits when using the item in ways that felt "correct"

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2022 20:57

The bounce property on enemies that block the boots would also really improve on this

=== @ Mitsukara 04/30/2022 20:59

Overall, the vanilla stomp boots are very much a "ooh, this sounds cool!" and then you try it and it's disappointing, kind of item. The ones in Legacy of the Wizard at least reliably hit the enemies and not the player, generally

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2022 21:00

(replying to @ Moosh "I'm also not sure, does the i…"): Survey says: Yes. They do still do this. A rule for that would be welcome
Maybe tack that onto the list

=== @ Mitsukara 04/30/2022 21:00

For good measure I will, yeah

=== @ Mitsukara 04/30/2022 21:04

(also, I'll understand if any of my convoluted suggestions don't work out / whatever the easiest way to implement any of it is.)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 03:18

I have no idea why it works the way it does currently

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 03:19

weapons in engine have specific kill/remove cases per weapon type

=== @ Mitsukara 05/01/2022 03:19

I don't suppose stomp boots just like, secretly make a not-properly-classed lweapon under link that dies after hitting one enemy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 03:20

(replying to @ Mitsukara "I don't suppose stomp boots j…"): you'd think if they did that, they'd make the weapon not something that hitting an enemy could remove

=== @ Mitsukara 05/01/2022 03:20

you'd think.... if you expected competence <:nekosip:876927395666477086>

<:nekosip:876927395666477086>

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 04:01

oh, no, it's worse
it's part of the damage link code
which... only checks one enemy per frame

=== @ Moosh 05/01/2022 04:02

ech
So it can't be like apply damage > continue instead of apply damage > break?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 04:04

```int32_t hit2 = diagonalMovement?GuyHit(x+4,y+4,z,8,8,hzsz):GuyHit(x+7,y+7,z,2,2,hzsz);
    
    
    
    if(hit2!=-1)
    {
        hithero(hit2);
        return;
    }```
```void HeroClass::hithero(int32_t hit2)
{
    //printf("Stomp check: %d <= 12, %d < %d\n", int32_t((y+16)-(((enemy*)guys.spr(hit2))->y)), (int32_t)falling_oldy, (int32_t)y);
    int32_t stompid = current_item_id(itype_stompboots);
    if(current_item(itype_stompboots) && checkbunny(stompid) && checkmagiccost(stompid) && (stomping ||
            (z > (((enemy*)guys.spr(hit2))->z)) ||
            ((isSideViewHero() && (y+16)-(((enemy*)guys.spr(hit2))->y)<=14) && falling_oldy<y)))
    {
        paymagiccost(stompid);
        hit_enemy(hit2,wStomp,itemsbuf[stompid].power*game->get_hero_dmgmult(),x,y,0,stompid);```

=== @ Moosh 05/01/2022 04:10

So if hithero returns a value based on the type of hit it can use that to cancel out of the return? Or could that have catastrophic results due to some c++ thing I'm not aware of?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 04:12

well I'd need to change hithero from a void to an int
also the return is there to prevent it going to weapon code
if the return isn't hit, it still wouldn't check another enemy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 04:14

So it'd need to loop through more than the first enemy, which means changing GuyHit to not just return the first enemy, but return the first enemy from a starting point

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 04:37

So probably poor form but I'm unsure if I want to make fixing this qr-based or not
I... don't see how anyone could rely on the old behavior of stomp boots

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 04:54

oh. Stomp Boots don't work if Link is invincible
lmfao

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 04:58

or if the enemy is stunned

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 05:03

what a good item

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 05:16

Okay, I think I fixed it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 05:19

wow cool they aren't a bad item anymore

=== @ Moosh 05/01/2022 05:19

squishy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/01/2022 05:21

am squishy

=== @ Mitsukara 05/03/2022 00:37

Thanks! If nothing else, having them work in the first place is nice.

Although, I am curious, how feasible are any of those other ideas I brought up originally? (No obligation to do any of that stuff obviously, but it could be neat to have some of it)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/03/2022 01:31

jumping would be really easy

=== @ P-Tux7 05/03/2022 21:00

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "which... only checks one enem…"): good ordinarily
i guess that's how the "prioritize higher damage combos" rule works

=== @ P-Tux7 05/03/2022 21:02

also "falling" player sprites might be nice, i always found the LA jump animation kind of awkward
though i wonder how one would enable them aside from a rule for every newly added animation
