Shouldn't it be the normal stun noise?

(meta) thread name was changed: [A104 Nightly] Digdogger Kids Making Boss Noise When Stunned

That's quest specific
I set it when doing it.  Might fix it at a later time

It think, it should be generalized, as flag "Keep emitting ambient sound, when stunned".

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2022 19:46

No I meant it made the "boss hurt" sound when stunned

=== @ NightmareJames 03/29/2022 19:47

I manually set that
I know that you're talking about

So maybe it's not a bug after all. Though this is a good idea Alucard
