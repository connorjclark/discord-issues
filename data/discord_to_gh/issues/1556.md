Currently the script runs immediately rather than running the warning dialog. I guess the user could write their own warning dialog, but...That's dumb. I just wanted to standardize the visuals on my F6 menu to fit with my game over menu, for consistency. Seems right now this comes at the cost of user experience as feather fingering the F6 key will result in lost level progress

realistically, the best way to handle this is to add a `cancel` option to the menu
that exits the script without calling a continue option
Unlike the `onDeath` slot, wherein you cannot 'undo' the death
you *can* just exit the onF6 script to resume exactly where you were before pressing F6
