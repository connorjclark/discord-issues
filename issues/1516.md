If you're on layer 1 and you copy the screen it should copy layer 1 rather than layer 0.

🤢 why?
Frankly, if I were a regular user, and I noticed that this was added, I would probably think it's a huge bug that needed to be reported

there does need to be a way to move a screen easily without needing to go to each layer screen individually and copy and paste it
(a better "paste all")
(cause the current one just sets the layers on the pasted screen to the old screen's layers, instead of copying to that screen's layers (like in the case of autolayered maps)
