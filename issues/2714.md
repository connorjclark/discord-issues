As of the latest nightly, the editor now crashes when I press "W" to toggle the solidity view, I don't know what you guys did but this is critical.

Crashes... are.... critical

SLG just reported this to me as well. She also claimed it only happens with the static for invalid data, though IDK how accurate that is since it's not consistent
I have not been able to reproduce this and SLG cannot reproduce it reliably. Any additional information you might have about your setup would be helpful @ FireSeraphim

Moosh do you have access to the sentry Web app for crashes?

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2023 02:45

@ Moosh this happens to me consistantly without fail

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Moosh do you have access to t‚Ä¶"): Oh apparently I do. I kinda just forgot ü§¶

=== @ Moosh 10/07/2023 02:56

And I see now which function is doing it and am increasingly concerned the blame's on me on this one üòõ

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/07/2023 03:28

Just now tested the newest nightly, still crashes when I press w

=== @ Moosh 10/07/2023 03:48

Oh yeah I haven't fixed anything yet

=== @ Moosh 10/07/2023 10:10

Took me a hot minute to see what it was, but it was indeed my fault. Should be fixed in the next nightly. And apologies for the inconvenience

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 21:55

Nice!

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/08/2023 18:16

This one can be closed now, Can confirm that the latest nightly fixes this
