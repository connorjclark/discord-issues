Not sure why this took me so long to notice, but at a glance, it looks like the Launcher Window is not updating it's appearance. If I click the ZC Player or ZQ Creator Buttons, they don't display being pressed but ZC / ZQuest still open up. Now noticed clicking on *anything* doesn't change the display. It still registers that I checked an option or changed tab, but there is NO change in the Window Display.
(for example, if I click the checkbox for "Lineral Scaling", the box does not change. If I close and reopen the launcher, now I'll see the checkbox has changed)

I didn't notice at first cause at this point it's expected to just copy over config files, so I usually don't have to mess with the launcher tabs.
But then wondered "hey, shouldn't the buttons show being pressed?"
