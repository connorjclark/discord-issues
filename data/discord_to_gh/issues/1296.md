Again this might be a bug from darkflamewolf's remake but those spikes that jump at you look like heart icons really strange. Not sure if that is intended but it looks like a bug.

did this happen in 1st dungeon?

native traps using wrong tile

Yes it happened in all situations

yikes, that's an issue
Might've been me, I'm the one who's been doing enemy stuff. I'll take a look

@ naturesucks what quest is that?
I can't replicate it in Origin

=== @ tim 12/24/2021 15:31

dfw's 1st remake
its a 1.92 b183 quest
im assuming something with quest compat shifted tiles

Weird, I can't seem to reproduce it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 11:41

@ naturesucks do you have any info on the build this was happening in?

=== @ tim 02/11/2022 14:19

one of the late alpha 100 nightlies

=== @ tim 02/11/2022 14:20

probably the last one before 101

ok discord, dont link the post then

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 16:15

okay, so it was broken but is no longer broken
the question is whether we fixed it, or if the broken behavior got shafted elsewhere

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 19:40

So I accidentally fixed it with a bandaid fix, but the real problem was that the ANONE compat rule was being flagged for pre-2.55 quests when it shouldn't have been. Fixed.
