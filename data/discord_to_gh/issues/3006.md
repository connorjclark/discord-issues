Don't understand the issue atm (haven't tried it). https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=78517&p=1076337

FYI @ Moosh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/22/2024 23:50

Poster mentions the mixer addition, but it could be any number of changes related to changing of music libs or allegro4->5

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 00:47

So I can definitely hear the difference. It kinda sounds like the max volume in 111 was over 100% causing slight distortion. Hard to tell though when sound stuff goes largely off vibes.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 00:59

so the default volumes for sfx and music is 64 (so 25%)
does that make sense for any program?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 01:02

I just checked Baldur's Gate 3, a game which I haven't modified any settings for. All sound options default to 100%.

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 01:06

100% makes sense if we're assuming the current volume level stays. 111's max volume was way too loud, actually painful to listen to. I believe Zoria boosted the base volume because he's hard of hearing (or pretending to be so). All his demo videos when he was dev had ZC volume at 100% and system volume at greater than that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 01:08

I looked around A111 code and couldn't tell how it may have played something beyond 100%, but it was an entirely different OGG backend
(this quest using ogg?)

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 01:09

Dreams realm uses a mix of formats but the starting town is either NSF or GBS?

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 01:19

actually now doing a second test I'm struggling to hear the difference. Wondering if I got bamboozled by the volume not updating until you reload the area thing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 01:23

yeah, zcmusic did not know how to update GME vol
until recently

these were defaults in A111...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 01:27

they were reduced to 64 in https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/ef6e5154c#diff-ace82674d08966f71845cfd6b59079f2c51bd0e83aa1fb1867198b956a3c6d8cR60

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 01:29

lets take care of a few things at once here...

1) 255 defaults. The expectation is that users control their system volume to reduce a program's volume below the default maximum output.

2) Remove separate controls for midi and enhanced music?

3) Remove the buffer control thing (@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) suggested)

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 01:30

```2) Remove separate controls for midi and enhanced music?```
Pretty strongly against this idea as some quests mix the two and balance them differently. At least keep it in a submenu if we're simplifying the volume controls

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 01:31

Lets keep then.

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 01:31

```3) Remove the buffer control thing (@Deedee suggested)```
This makes sense. Could we also get rid of digi? As I understand it that one's reundant and only serves as a multiplier for other volumes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 01:31

Is "enhanced" the best term to use here though
oh I didnt event notice digi

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 01:32

Probably not but it's kinda a grandfathered term. Like "DMap"
It's unclear what it does but it's been referred to as that in several places for a long enough time that people have internalized it
could maybe use a help button for clarification?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 01:33

"Specify volumes for both digital
   samples and MIDI playback"
so its allegro 4 music streams?
as a global volume control for a4 streams (they have their own vol too)

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 01:34

yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 01:35

yeah that could just share the setting for "emusic" I guess.
err
or just use 255?
since we map emusic to the individual a4 stream already

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 01:36

yeah if it was always 255 I don't think anybody would miss it

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 01:50

Okay I am noticing a significant volume difference, but not in town. Rather when entering any cave. Ether pointed this out, it just BLASTS the cave music for some reason. That one seems to be OGG

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 01:51

On which zc version?

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 01:51

on 120

commit 61d038072fff15585db5e67f47cc952c212db6e4 (tag: 3.0.0-prerelease.9+2023-11-29, upstream/compare-baseline-61d03807)

    fix(zc): initialize fadevolume to avoid undefined behavior

    This fixes a bug where music would randomly be silent or extremely loud.

    Also, cap the volume used to play music to 255, to avoid ever playing
    it so loud again.
```
You are playing on 120 actual, or latest release?

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 02:09

latest release. The cave music for whatever reason sounds twice as loud as it did in 111
cuz yeah, I thought maybe it was that, but it seems not to be

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 02:15

I wonder if the qst has a script that is setting digi_music / emusic_volume

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 02:16

Can't be because I'm using the version saved in 2.53 to test. Otherwise that could be it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 02:22

entered this cave but hear no music 👀

you hear loud, I hear nothing, how is this the same bug again?

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 02:23

did you download the enhanced music and put it in the folder with the quest?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 02:23

yeah, I hear the town music fine

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 02:23

huh
that is very alarming then

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 02:29

uh my pc cant play those OGGs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 02:31

Had to update VLC now VLC can play it.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 02:32

Doesn't change how ZC behaves, tho. Introduction.ogg does not load ...
...doh
hoisted by my own petard
I am not compiling with OGG

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 02:34

ha!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 02:48

Is it because in A111 OGG was using a4 streams, so applied the digi_volume  25% multipliers
and now it uses a5 streams, so digi_volume is not reducing it
A111 w/ digi set to 255 and emusic 255 sounds same as recent build with emusic set to 255

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 02:55

But 111 defaulted digi to 248 so that'd be near max volume right?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 02:56

correct
fwiw I just tried both and they sounded the same to me
fresh A11
vs recent build (but max volume)

=== @ Moosh 01/23/2024 02:57

huh

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2024 03:58

(replying to @ Moosh "```3) Remove the buffer contr…"): I'm wondering if enhanced music volume for tracker music is bugged; digi seemed to be the only thing that affected it for 2.55

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 05:18

is that GME or DUH?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2024 05:27

nsf files
so famitracker music
possible I'm misremembering though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 05:30

Working for me.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 06:46

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "lets take care of a few thing…"): Did 1 and 3 here, and removed digi_volume (but just from the ui)
Can't repro the other problems mentioned here :/
