When doing changes, you will be taken to the screen where the combos being changed are. 

What this means is if undoing/redoing a layer, you will be taken to the screen of that layer. The act of changing screens also becomes part of the undo/redo stack.

The tiles with the pink BG are layer 0 still, even though teh mouse cursor hovered over the layer 3 button at the start.
