It would be a nice extra convenience if the `Triggers->States/Spawning` tab in the combo editor included level switch states as well

I mean
You could use a switch combo

=== @ vlamart 03/24/2023 10:27

I know, but would help reduce layers if I didn't have to put one over or under a combo of another type that I want switched

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/24/2023 10:27

oh, you're meaning `LSwitch State->`
not `->LSwitch State`

=== @ vlamart 03/24/2023 10:28

Yeah!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/24/2023 10:28

makes more sense lol

@ vlamart Well it looks like I got carried away with it

basically has all the functionality of a switch combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/26/2023 20:06

This is a nice example, will need the next nightly to use it

Neat, thanks!  Looks awesome!

What does that "Time Out Item" checkbox on the right side of that screenshot do?  Does that just mean the item will vanish like any other normal enemy drop if left alone for a while?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/28/2023 14:47

yeah, notice that's the item pickup flags section
those are just normal item pickup flags, for the item spawned by the combo, if any
so yeah, that's the normal "item fades away after a while like enemy drops"
