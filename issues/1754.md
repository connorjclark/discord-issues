I think this might be a bit of a big request, but it would be very helpful if there were built in functions to keep track of things like the previous screen the player was on, the previous map, their previous position, etc. I'm not sure how comprehensive this should be, but at the very least the things I listed would help immensely with screen-related scripts.

i know there has to be two screen IDs/combo display data stored in RAM at least, for scrolling
actually, their solidity data too, for smart scrolling

Do note how clunky it is to keep track of these things manually with a header too. Having a big array you have to index with a bunch of constants that are all equivalent to specific functions or variables is crusty in my humble opinion!

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i know there has to be two sc…"): ....EVERY SCREEN IS IN RAM
at ALL TIMES
otherwise NOTHING would work

gives crazed office worker energy

(replying to @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) "I think this might be a bit o…"): you can track this stuff yourself easily enough
and generic scripts allow setting events based on them, too

It's not terribly difficult to but unironically having to be like `if(MISC[GLOBAL_PREVIOUS_DMAP] != Game-GetCurDMap()){//blah}` or whatever is clunky
I don't remember if that's the proper name for the function on the right but that's not really the point
The generic scripts thingy sounds helpful admittedly
but the necessary naming schema for arrays and constants for this kind of stuff isn't very conducive to actually using them imo

```cpp
genericdata script onScreenChange
{
    void run()
    {
        unless(this->DataSize) setup();
        if(this->Data[0] != -1)
        {
            //Do something when the screen changes.
            //this->Data[0] is the previous screen.
        }
        this->Data[0] = Game->GetCurScreen();
        while(true)
            Waitframe();
    }
    void setup()
    {
        this->ReloadState[GENSCR_ST_CHANGE_SCREEN] = true;
        this->DataSize = 1;
        this->Data[0] = -1;
    }
    void init()
    {
        if(scr = checkGenericScript("onScreenChange"))
        {
            Game->LoadGenericData(scr)->Running = true;
        }
    }
}```

Oh interesting
Would you mind explaining how you would use that to do something
e.g. how to "get" the previous screen number, in that case
