Noticed game wouldn't start, turned JIT off, suddenly works. Oof.

Are you sure? It may just be taking a minute.
Also `jit_precompile = 1` will make it take quite awhile

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 17:57

oh...could be then

This feature is off by default mainly for this reason - it is slow for large scripts. Fixing that by 1) compiling just the bits needed to run _right now_ or 2) precompile ahead of time and cache for future runs are both rather tricky.

I tried loading the quest and it appeared to have hung, but I was in a bit of a hurry. Did so several times. Then loaded a different quest which did not hang. That one was smaller though.
I'll try running it again and just leave it idling for a bit

Ohp, it did indeed load after a few minutes. Sorry for the false alarm. I'm not used to quests taking that long. Also don't know how those configs got enabled again after I _just turned them off after the last issue_

Everything JIT related is *off by default*, so resetting to default settings would not cause that
. . . but uh. . .

Seems like something could be REALLY FUCKY with configs

=== @ Moosh 06/05/2023 18:05

could be. Or I might just be a moron and turned it on briefly to test the fix, then forgot
