> and what about my suggestion on a second box that autofills with the actual destination number when you type in your offsetted destintation number in the screen warp box. I came up with that specifically to deal with a frustrating thing where when warping from OW to dungeon maps you end up sometimes getting the destination number wrong due to dungeon map offsetting

I guess I'll just post the mockup itself

I don't think that's necessary
we need to rewrite the whole UI anyway to update it to the new system and then work within the new system's design constraints

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/22/2023 19:57

I see.

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "> Emily — 10/02/2021 7:28 PM…"): ^ The design probably wouldn't change too much from now aside from being in the same dialog
at least, if I did it. Though it'll probably be @ Moosh's whenever he feels up to it.

=== @ FireSeraphim 08/22/2023 19:58

I see...

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "> FireSeraphim — 10/02/2021 7…"): ^ but this is a really good idea
and shouldn't be bad to implement in the new gui system
...you'll still only be able to EDIT the box that's offset
probably
