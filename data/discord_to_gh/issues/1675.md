Started looking at this. Some notes

- Many places append `\0` to the end of the format string, which was needed in MSVC...but only in the old days. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/13067917/2788187 . We should remove the hacks for `#define snprintf _snprintf` in MSVC and just use `snprintf` since it is now available, then remove all the explicit null terminators in format strings.

- no idea why many format strings will divide an int by a long constant... ex: `sprintf(str, "-%d.%04d\0", abs(b/10000L), abs(b%10000L));`  ... seem unnecessary? Can maybe just delete the `L` and fix the format errors.

Not related to format warning, but... these null bytes are also doing nothing.

(strcpy already copies the null byte of the string literal...)

Most of these errors can be autofixed. here's how:

```cmake
target_compile_options(zlauncher PRIVATE -Werror=format -ferror-limit=10000 "SHELL:-Xclang -fix-what-you-can" "SHELL:-Xclang -fixit-recompile")
```

It was a long constant because consistency, long constants were previously used in such situations
and the associated data was `long` type
