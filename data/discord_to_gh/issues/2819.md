Natural way to fix this it to save the a5 display bitmap, not the a4 screen bitmap. However this saves the image to the size of the display resolution. Is this OK?

It seems the other one - Screen Snapshot - is what you'd use to export tiles / palette / etc. And that can remain as it is.

aye, sounds sane
