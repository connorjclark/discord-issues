I suspect this one's a pipe dream, but similar to Enemies Flicker When Hit, it would be nice to have a quest rule that makes enemies flicker to a single color in the palette. This is inspired by how BS hit animations work but accounting for how ZC doesn't reserve the proper CSets for that. The idea would be when you hit the enemy it flashes to a single color mask of its sprite but the sprite. The color used would be specified in Init Data under Vars, similar to the darkness color. It would also respect the flicker rate in this request:

Both these requests would revolutionize the utility of 8-bit heavy tilesets like Firebird
Since their only option for enemy hit animations is the flicker

Enemy code is JankMcJank. It needs to be rewritten from scratch, which takes ages to do.
