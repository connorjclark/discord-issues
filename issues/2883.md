apparently any amount over 5 will crash zquest in the latest nightly  according to some users.

setMapCount2 does `TheMaps.resize(c*MAPSCRS);` which invalidates the pointer that `zmap::screens` holds.
Found this instantly w/ Asan.

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) is this related to anything you might've been doing?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/02/2023 06:04

not that I'm at all aware of
...I have touched some `zmap` stuff but nothing that would have fucked with the pointer logic

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/02/2023 07:43

I assumed it was `7e5e83 fix(zq): 'Go' in warp dialogs not rebuilding transparency table`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/02/2023 08:07

well I don't see how ```cpp
    if(!oldcolor || *oldcolor != newcolor)
        rebuild_trans_table();
```is gonna make `screens` an invalid pointer... so don't think that'll be it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/02/2023 08:12

Can someone perform a bisect to be sure?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/02/2023 19:25

confirmed it was `7e5e83` via bisect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/02/2023 20:04

....oh ffs
i see
the `if(screens)` check stops it when its null but not when its invalidated, ffs
...probably sane to just like, re-assign the pointer BEFORE the `getcolor()` call then?
and boundcheck that it's valid

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/02/2023 21:14

Best to reassign after resizing the vector
Otherwise it's a bandaid not a real fix
And somewhere else will break one day

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/02/2023 21:20

ah, fair lol

this, called from `setMapCount2` after resize, I think would handle it?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/02/2023 22:35

Looks fine, but you tell me... Did it fix it? 

I will do new releases when this fix lands

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/02/2023 22:35

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Looks fine, but you tell me..‚Ä¶"): I'm not reproducing the issue, soo

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/02/2023 22:36

Use ASAN
It happens always under asan.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/02/2023 22:36

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> fun asan again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/02/2023 22:46

üëç
looks like vs is crashing now but it did indeed fix
vs hates ASAN
