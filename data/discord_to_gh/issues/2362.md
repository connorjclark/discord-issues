This is the nitpickiest of low priority nitpicks, but the hammer's middle down facing frame draws behind Link instead of in front of him, in most cases resulting it it being almost completely obscured. I don't know how long this has been a thing, possibly since the item's introduction. It was like this in 2.53. It draws like this for all of two frames, so no wonder nobody noticed.

Another hammering quirk is that the impact particles are spawned at the start of the swing, 5 frames early from what I'd expect. It might be that the animation actually looks better this way as the human eye isn't great at catching frame discrepancies that small.

yeah melee weapon animation in general could use a spruce-up except for z1 sword
link's frames don't quite match up with the sword when slashing or spinning
(use frame advance)
