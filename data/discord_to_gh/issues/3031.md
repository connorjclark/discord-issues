This has been reported a bunch, but I don't actually see a thread here for it, so might as well post it. Some recent discussion on the issue:

Want to verify in web version, which uses Timidity for midi, if any better
Still want to use timidity for midi synth directly, as it solves problems in linux.
But maybe its also just better than a4 + OS synt
