Copying the pictures from ZC Help in two different scenarios:

Scenario 2:

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/02/2021 23:20

I encountered this glitch recently as well when I was testing the ancient aquaducts dungeon in HF. For some reason an offsetted chest I had in the dungeon was already opened despite me never visiting it.

Chest worked fine into this

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Is there any chance that the chest combo changes caused this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:33

Well, those changes are required for something like this to work at all
So almost certainly related

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:34

two tile chests tend to involve linked combos (copycats)
and this one would IMO be a maor compat issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:35

To have only half the combo be openable requires the new collision checks

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:35

might be wise for now to add a temp rule and use the old chest code for old quests until you can do a proper fix

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:35

That already exists as a compat rule
Old quests always use the old code

@ DeletedUser no bug, your setup is wrong
4 combos, in order:

This setup works fine
(replying to @ NightmareJames ""): ^This image is a notable mistake in yours; that's a closed chest, it should have the chest type and inherent flag, not be (None)
