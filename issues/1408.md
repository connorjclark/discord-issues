This happens when writing to a tempscreen for an invalid layer, as in one not assigned via the editor. A previous report saw this fixed so graphics get updated on the layer, but the combos still don't seem fully functional. If the combo I'm changing is solid, it doesn't behave as such on layers 1&2. And if it has extra properties such as a damage combo or warp it doesn't obey those either.

Here's a link to that report. Initial subject of the report was not a bug, but the tempscreen behavior got changed here

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) I pray you can fix this for me
I'm almost certain the issue is
something checking `mapscr.layermap[ind] != 0`, that needs to instead check `layerscr->valid`

Sorry for always being the bear of bad news. Bright side for me, this one's super workaroundable

@ Moosh uploading a nightly soon, if you want to test if this fixes everything. Should definitely fix solidity, and I hope it fixes any other issues too....
