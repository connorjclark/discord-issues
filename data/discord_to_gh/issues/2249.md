I just lost a 30 minute session because it somehow didn't save and I just realized this is gonna screw up new users BIG TIME. Maybe I hit RETRY on accident?

Or possibly have it be a setting for the player, and anyone who turns it on is acknowledging that "if it autosaves and you want to RETRY but now it saved over your file, that's on you"

It would have to be a feature the quest maker sets
which, makes it really not that worthwhile to add given how simple such would be to script

Saving in ZC is also far more intrusive than ZQ. I'd hate to have an autosave throw off my timing in a tight gameplay section

(replying to @ Moosh "Saving in ZC is also far more…"): Or ruin save entirely. You unlock wrong door and discover troll that says "Ganon Wins" and nothing more, Now you are missing a key to finish dungeon. You want to load previous save, but auto save has already overwritten finishable save file.

And as Moosh said, saving lags ZC for it`s duration, freezing all action until it finishes. This can easily ruin the day in difficult quests.

(replying to @ Alucard648 "Or ruin save entirely. You un…"): note to everyone: if you do this i am quitting your quest
