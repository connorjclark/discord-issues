When an object like a bush or rock is lifted, the damage it deals is iffy.

With true Z-Axis on, thrown objects will only hit enemies flying or jumping through Z. It will not deal damage to enemies on the ground even if you hit them directly.

It may be that the thrown object is breaking before it checks collision with an enemy.

Ideally, the thrown object should have a hitbox that is at least 16 tall, and probably have an offset of -10 Z, what with how flattening works in engine.

Fix pt. 1: thrown weapons (or any weapon with the "breaks on landing" property) now run a full collision check as they land, before they are marked dead. This allows them to hit enemies that they land on - and the player, if that applies.

(replying to @ Mani Kanina "Ideally, the thrown object sh…"): so, uh, the problem here....
is that there isn't actually a proper z offset, IIRC?
or rather, there's a z-offset, which offsets *both* the draw and the hit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/07/2023 14:09

so to do this properly we'd need to add a whole new offset to all the systems and bleh... that sounds like a loot of work
Gonna say that this should be filed as a separate feature request?

=== @ Mani Kanina 12/07/2023 17:15

without something like that though, mid air collisions, a la GB games, can't happen unless you use fake-Z.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/08/2023 01:28

yep, unfortunate
definitely gonna require a bit of work to add that so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 06:12

(replying to @ Mani Kanina "without something like that t…"): this is honestly big enough of a thing that it should be added as a separate feature request. (The behavior isn't a 'bug', it's how ZC's Z-axis has *always* worked - the only actual BUG here was the not hitting things the weapon lands on, which is fixed)
