I'm running into a bizzare issue where items play the wrong pickup string instead of their intended pickup screen. I believe the following screenshots illustrate the problem I'm running into.

The item on screen is the same one shown in the editor in the first screenshot

gonna need more info because I can't replicate the issue

=== @ P-Tux7 06/13/2023 03:07

what string ID is playing
and how many strings do you have

=== @ FireSeraphim 06/13/2023 13:01

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I think it has something to do with my string setup and the way my strings are ordered. Mind if I sent you the current build of my quest?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/13/2023 17:01

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> yeah, the list order being out of order isn't being accounted for in the item editor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/13/2023 17:38

should be fixed

=== @ FireSeraphim 06/13/2023 18:10

aye, still waiting for the next nightly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/14/2023 01:16

=== @ FireSeraphim 06/14/2023 01:16

Now the string dropdown for the item menu is kinda scrambled in comparison to the actual string menu

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/14/2023 20:59

the item one is in numerical order
check `Sort Numerically` in the string editor and it should look the same between them
....I can fix this, but, lower priority than making the damn dropdown actually *work*

=== @ FireSeraphim 06/14/2023 21:04

I see. I hope this get fixed soon
I have my string sorted in a certain way for a reason and that reason is mostly organization based

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/14/2023 21:47

Oh, it's not even in numeric order, huh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/14/2023 22:06

fixed

=== @ FireSeraphim 06/14/2023 22:17

thank you. I look forward to testing this in the newest nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 13:30

@ FireSeraphim ?

=== @ FireSeraphim 06/27/2023 14:47

I can confim the string sort issue has been fixed
