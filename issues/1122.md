Secrets->Item doesn't trigger on a screen with Hit All Triggers->Perm Secret until you leave the screen and re-enter. Inconsequential to me, but may affect other's design.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/19/2021 02:16

Guessing `Screen->SecretsTriggered()` is also returning false in that circumstance?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/12/2021 10:14

interested here too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:06

so, actually, I feel like I understand the issue here
I'm guessing if you place a bomb/burn/arrow/etc flag, it also won't trigger those?
and that it would only trigger flags `16-31`?

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:17

Sorry for late response. Been a while since the screen where I ran into this issue. In my case it was a group of torches with flags 4/95. No 16-31 on the screen though I believe I tested with that flag both on and off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:18

Err, my point was, try placing a bomb flag somewhere in the screen
And it won't trigger from all torches being lit
Is my theory

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:19

Yeah that is the idea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:19

So, it also doesn't trigger secrets->item
As screen secrets are not triggered
Just 16-31 are triggered

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:19

But there's a flag for that
And on reentering the screen the item did drop

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:20

Because it set perm secrets
So on re- entering, all secrets trigger

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:20

And this isn't a bug?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:20

technically intended behavior, since it only triggers 16-31

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:21

I think something's not coming across here but gotta eat dinner. bbl

is this flagged or not?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:25

oh
yeah
fucking wow
`fTRIGGERFPERM` sets perm secrets
but *not temp secrets*
`fTRIGGERF1631` changes flags 16 through 31 to their secret combos
but does not trigger *any* type of "secrets"
it manually replaces flag 16-31 spaces
so, neither of these triggers "temp secrets"
thus nothing calls down the item
this seems mostly intentional, based on the design of these flags
....changing the `->Perm Secret` one to also trigger temp secrets, and adding a compat rule for the old behavior, would probably be smart though.

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:45

Aha I see
It seems to me like ->Perm Secret should set the temp secret as well, especially if it does so immediately upon reentering the screen already
because that's the main thing that makes the behavior seem buggy. That it's behaving differently when the secret is triggered vs. when the screen is entered

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:46

it's "technically intentional"
but the idea that anything that doesn't trigger the screen's full temp secrets should set the perm secret flag is flawed inherently

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:47

mhm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:47

....the same issue existed with `Enemies->Secret` being permanent until a recent QR addition
as, did you know Enemies->Secret only triggered 16-31, and nothing else?

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 23:48

Secrets system kinda sounds like a mess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 23:48

it really is
inherently flawed in many ways

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/899841391042134116/909590620732014592/buildpack.zip?ex=65e50c47&is=65d29747&hm=6c7de372fb65a1054875a05614ba504210066d8bb3a2d9b562867e378cece6f6&
so, try this
will need to disable compat rule

(meta) thread name was changed: 💊🔓Secrets-Item does not spawn with hit all triggers
(try in a more recent build than the one posted above as that's a bit old now)
