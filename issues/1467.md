The setup for setting up controller joypad, the button assignments are always stuck. When you click them with a mouse they always get stuck and it is difficult to set up your controllers buttons.
This does not happen with Keyboard setup.

can you set your controller inputs at all?
is your controller plugged in before starting ZC?
