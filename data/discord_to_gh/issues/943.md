Not everyone likes to hear poor Link die every time ZScript fails to compile. An option to replace that horrible sound with different one, like explosion SFX, would be great.

this is actually already possible

check zquest.cfg

=== @ mitchfork 08/25/2021 02:52

it's at the top of zquest.cfg
ye
the numbers for all the samples are just SFX ID's for the quest file
and you can set the volume too

Tried to change SFX, but it resets to default every time ZQuest is restarted.

Oh?
let me check on that

I don't see any reason why changing `compile_error_sample` wouldn't be changing the error sound

=== @ Alucard648 08/25/2021 03:14

Tried again. Now it worked, all of the sudden. Perharps, sound options should be available in compiler settings of ZQuest editor, especially as compiler options dialog is almost empty in 2.53.x .
