Decorations and particles need a couple things.

1. Separate from 'sprite' class, to save much unneeded memory
2. Give ZScript the ability to create/read them
3. A layer attribute to make them draw on a particular layer (have a `bool engine;`, where if true, uses the old timing; when false, draws with it's layer arg)

Particles were separated. Also particles *already have a layer attribute*. Now they just need script access.
