Prints array contents into output console, multiple elements per line.
For example, array with 16 zeroes printed 8 elements per row:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Followed by newline.
Useful for debugging scripts that work with arrays. Otherwise, iterating through all elements of array and printing them into console will clog console with data printed 1 per line, and it`s quite diffucult to find important stuff in output.

`printf("%ad\n", arr);`

Not quite as you requested, but does the job
(It does them all in one line)
and, it handles arrays of any data type
the example I gave (`%ad`) will do each index as a number (because `%d` is the printf parameter for numbers)
`%aX` would print them as hex numbers using capital letters
`%ab` would print them in binary
etc etc
