Oh I haven't tried the latest alpha yet, let me try it

=== @ Twilight Knight 04/10/2023 13:51

Nope it's also broken in that version
Other features of the preview mode work fine

ohshit I actually experienced this in April 8th's nightly and I thought I was just being derpy.  I guess I can verify that this does seem to be a problem in this one, yeah.
I'll try it in the new 4/10 alpha when I get home.

Or not.  Did it at work because I'm baller like that or something.
Didn't work in Alpha 4/10 either.

When I hit "c" they turn into the regular mountain tiles and don't animate.  I set those two mountain tiles to animate for a few frames and cycle to each other.   In combo cycling preview mode, they just freeze.   They should loop to each other.
