A combo flag or a flag on the Switch Block combo that makes it "count" as a pushable block for block trigger purposes, but is un*push*able. It only serves to be swapped with and depress a block trigger.

So a Push (No Way) flag?

Basically

I... was about to say `doesn't this exist?`
but then I looked
and, it very clearly doesn't
I certainly *INTENDED* to have something for this....
A placeable flag is a fair bit of work to add
but, adding a flag on the SwitchHook Block combo type, should be easy enough

oh and please test to make sure that they can't be fail-hooked when on a block trigger
said friend was complaining about that when switch blocks were used with a pushblock flag
is that even a bug to report or intended?
i admittedly haven't used the real switch hook because i haven't played oracle of ages

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2022 00:06

That's intended
The combo is hookable, but it's locked in place

=== @ P-Tux7 02/19/2022 00:18

Makes sense
They called it ugly and I kind of agree but I AM having trouble thinking of a better way to communicate it
