See video. Works both ways. I already checked to see if the under combo tiles somehow had an inherent push flag applied and there was no such thing.

Oh, I guess it happens in all 4 directions, because I managed to do it upwards as well just now

@ Phosphor can't get it to happen no matter what I try in any direction, including using your EXACT set of QRs

=== @ Phosphor 09/24/2023 19:36

Apparently I have this passive ability to find weird-ass bugs that are hard to reproduce

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2023 19:36

quest file?

It seems to *only* affect under combo tiles
I can't get it to do it to any other tiles

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> so
don't put a push flag
on a `Push(Generic)`

=== @ Phosphor 09/24/2023 20:07

oops lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2023 20:22

should also be fixed in the next nightly
(the if chain for the push(generic) wasn't setting the bool to erase the push flag, because I hadn't accounted for someone trying that)
(the push(generic) is designed to be used without any push flags, you set the push directions on the combo itself instead, and it completely ignores push flags placed on it)
