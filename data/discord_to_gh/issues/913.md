Bug Report: In Mystical Harps, the following three screens have a LOT in common, and they all throw a very big error. Picking up any item on them will cause string 65 to be played. They all have the same shop, same string, (possibly) same guy, and two of the same flags set Item Falls From Ceiling, and Hold Up Item.

non-scripted items, right?

=== @ DergerSwerson 08/17/2021 16:10

yes, one of the items to which this situation responded did not have any scripts on it, even the janky ass old pickup timer scripts. I had both scripts cleared and this still happened. It happens on these screens. Something about all these screens triggers it, and I TraceS()ed every instance of Screen->Message in the global script

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ? Any ideas?

=== @ DergerSwerson 08/17/2021 16:14

i have a zillion that arent readily apparent, including checking and unchecking every rule that says string in it,  digging into the secondary files, and so on, and ill get to that, but i was thinking since these screens had so much in common something had to be the case

=== @ DergerSwerson 08/17/2021 16:16

it could be any number of things referencing any number of things 🥵

=== @ P-Tux7 08/17/2021 18:27

check your global script

Don’t forget other strings were showing also, not just 65
