Noticed when an enemy is colliding with two solid FFCs moving at opposing directions, it has a directional bias. Whereas when Link collides, he ends up centered

Enemies also seem to clip slightly into solid FFCs on the top and left edges, getting them stuck

Does this occur only when ffcs are at subpixels?

=== @ Moosh 04/17/2023 00:35

Nope

=== @ Moosh 04/17/2023 00:36

The behavior seems the same when they are and aren't placed at subpixels

(replying to @ Moosh "Enemies also seem to clip sli…"): Fixed, also movement snaps to subpixel now- no rounding involved on the actual movement. (Still rounding involved for combo checks, though solid object checks are subpixel-precise now.)

(replying to @ Moosh "Noticed when an enemy is coll…"): This one.... is just odd. I have no idea what would cause this. But, I mean, they use ENTIRELY separate code, soo....
(Fun fact, it uses movexy for enemies being pushed!)

(....so, this inconsistency may just be a quirk that stays?)

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Fixed, also movement snaps to…"): So, the FFC below the enemy is placed `0.0010` subpixel. You can see it snaps properly!
