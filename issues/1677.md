The title isn't even close to the full story. The bug is that if the Bomb Item is hidden in the Subscreen, and then the Player gets Bomb Capacity and Ammo from an Item and the now should be revealed Bomb Item would occupy an empty subscreen button... it doesn't, until some sort of game update (like changing screens)

By Hidden, I mean the QR `No Ammo Required to Display Subscreen Items` is toggled off, but the player also starts with the Bomb Item (set to give the player no Ammo or Capacity), and the Game Init has Bomb Ammo Capacity start at 0.

If the player then picks up an item that increases Bomb Capacity over 0 (and also gives ammo), like a Bomb Bag, and the player has an empty button slot in their subscreen, the Bomb Item does not occupy the empty button slot, *and* does not appear in the Active Subscreen.
Upon changing screens, the game updates, and the Bomb Item will appear in the Button Slot and the Active Inventory now.
I put together a test quest to demonstrate this.

So, if you just go one screen north and get the Bomb bag, you'll see this bug in action.
If you grab the Wand first, which goes into Slot B, then go for the Bomb Bag, the bug does not occur.
