It's exactly as it says on the tin.  I've got screens with layers 0, 1, and 3 active.  If I Ctrl-Click anywhere on layers 0 or 3, it's fine.  If I Ctrl-Click anywhere on layer 1, ZQuest crashes.

This is with the bug-fix Emily gave me that fixed the Combo Insert Offsets.  This:  https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1021391932905234432/1022297440176570547

what the fuck

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/23/2022 20:46

I can upload the quest if you'd like.  I hope I'm wrong.

<Open quest again after crash>
<Arrive on screen it crashed on>
<Go to Layer 1>
<Ctrl-Click anywhere>
<crash>

no, no, you don't need to give me anything
because I opened ZC and did it on the random quest that I last had open
and instantly reproduced it

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/23/2022 20:49

Oof.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 20:49

I'm just fucking confused
at how that is possible
and what the fuck change could have caused it

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/23/2022 20:50

Sorry for the weekend hassle.  D:

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/23/2022 21:59

I'm aware of the bug
Will fix later today.
It's a stack overflow üôÇ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2022 22:01

Oh, it's your undo stuff... That makes more sense

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/23/2022 22:12

I saw it in the crash reports last week. Hehe

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/24/2022 04:41

pushed a fix.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/24/2022 08:45

Confirmed fixed.  Thanks!

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/25/2022 09:27

I got this crash on all layers above 0, not just layer 1.

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/25/2022 09:29

Oh wait new nightly just came out.

=== @ Tabletpillow 09/25/2022 09:31

Okay yeah it's been fixed, nice. Sorry for bumping.
