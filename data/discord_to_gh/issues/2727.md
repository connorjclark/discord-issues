After Darkmatt pointed out some oddities to me on the Pure server, I think some include and header folder spring cleaning is in order. Proposing the following changes:
# Docs:
- REMOVE stdWeaponsReadMe.txt: This is for a header that isn't packaged by default
- REMOVE Zelda_Classic_and_ZQuest_2.53_API_Specification.pdf and Zelda_Classic_and_ZQuest_2.54_Specification.pdf: These are for older versions and I don't believe a single soul has read them
- REMOVE Classic.txt: Old Zoria scripts.
- MOVE ZScript_Memory_Access_Speed.txt, ZScript_Timing.txt, zasm_registers.txt: Should be moved to a zscript_technical subfolder as these are not helpful to most users.
- OUTDATED std.txt: Do we want to continue supporting this?
- OUTDATED combos.txt
- OUTDATED ffrules.txt
- UNCERTAIN __future_logic_diagram.txt: What is this and what benefit does it give the end user?
- UNCERTAIN _version_semantics.txt: Are we even using this versioning scheme currently?
- UNCERTAIN zscript_manual.rtf: How updated and relevant is this? Who made it? Skimming over it there appears to be some useful info but also some info that isn't even about ZScript???
# Include:
- REMOVE assert.zh: This is already in std
- REMOVE Classic.zh: Old Zoria scripts
- REMOVE bitmap.zh: Outdated
- REMOVE stdExtra.zh: I'll be honest I just don't like this one. It's a database header from pre 2015, not even up to date with the PZC database and full of outdated tech. If people want it they can just get it there.
- REMOVE EmilyMisc.zh: Is there anything essential in here? Seems to be outdated versions of functionality currently in std
# std_zh:
Zoria apparently used this folder as a header dumping ground, as there's a bunch of files with assorted functions of variable utility that are not included by default with std. As such I don't think it'd harm compat to remove them.
- REMOVE a74.txt: Outdated
- REMOVE goriyaspecialitem.zh: What is this even for? Does not appear to be included in std
- REMOVE dmapgfx.zh: Possibly merge? Are these useful? Why such a small file? Also not included in std
- REMOVE dmapgrid.zh: Possibly merge? Once again are these useful enough to be worth inclusion? Also not included in std
- REMOVE idata.zh: 2.54 comments indicate good things surely. Seems unncessary. Also not included in std
- REMOVE infostring.zh: Possibly merge? This is another small one whose utility I am uncertain of. Also not included in std
- REMOVE kb_parser_test.zh: Unsure what this is but appears unhelpful. Also not included in std
- REMOVE nme.zh: This is an old Zoria script. Not included in std
- REMOVE roomtype_catchall.zh: This is a couple enums for roomtypes and catchalls. They appear to be redundant
- REMOVE roomtypes.zh: Identical to the previous file
- REMOVE std_platform.zh: Possibly merge? This is just a single function. For lweapons??? Not included in std
- REMOVE std_update.zh: Appears to just be redundant functions that have already been added to std_functions.zh. Not included in std
- REMOVE stdMore.zh: Appears to be more redundant functions. Also not included in std
- MERGE std_extension.zh: Why is this a separate file from std_functions?
- UNCERTAIN LISP.zh: I'm not sure what benefits this provides at a glance. It's a rather large file so I'm hesitant to say toss it, but it's not included in std

After cleaning up superfluous std stuff, I eventually want to do a large scale update, relocating all the outdated and unsupported functions to a separate file, trying to get it in a more presntable state and reducing the amount of functions to sift through when covering std for the webdocs.
# Headers:
- REMOVE ghost2.zh and ghost3.zh: These are an outdated version of the ghost header and a planned future version for which AFAIK all support has been dropped. No reason to package these
- REMOVE ghost_legacy.zh: I see nothing referencing this file and it's so ancient that nobody will be using it. I don't think it will be missed
- REMOVE ghostYR.zh, ghost_zh/2.8/ghost2_updateYR.zh and ghost_zh/2.8/ghost2_yuurand.zh: These are Yuurand's hacked up ghost.zh files. They should never have been packaged to begin with
- REMOVE stdCombos.zh: Old header that probably isn't relevant in 2.55. But more important I take umbrage with the usage of the std name. This is not a standard header, it is not in the include folder. It should not be presented as such.
- UNCERTAIN gui.zh: This is Emily's old GUI stuff. Is this still needed?

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) Thoughts?

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2023 06:10

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) for extra measure. Assuming you want ghost3 gone, IDK why it ended up there to begin with

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2023 06:34

`__future_logic_diagram.txt`: Nonsense, toss it.

`_version_semantics.txt`: Toss it.

Some files you've mentioned are already gone (like the specification pdfs or that RTF file).

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2023 06:35

Oops, yeah. I realized partway through I wasn't looking at a fresh install and didn't go back to review some of the earlier stuff.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2023 06:36

Love idea of cleaning up this stuff. Way too much no-value noise here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2023 06:37

Why we have a `headers` and a `include` folder? can't work out what the distinction is there

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2023 06:38

`ZScript_Memory_Access_Speed.txt`: delete this

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2023 06:39

They used to be one folder I think but were split to distinguish files that were supported by the ZC dev team and just stuff that was pulled off the PZC database
problem with pulling from the PZC database is that sometimes people like...update their stuff

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/10/2023 07:05

wonder if headers should be nuked
just use include; if there's essential stuff we want in there just use our own stuff
(replying to @ Moosh "@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) for ext…"): yeah I'm really annoyed it ended up on there
I explicitly wanted to wait for a full release on it but Zoria just decided to include it; and I think it could use some touchup

=== @ vlamart 10/10/2023 10:25

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "I explicitly wanted to wait f…"): Does this mean ghost 3.5?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/10/2023 10:27

maybe; probably wouldn't call it ghost

=== @ vlamart 10/10/2023 10:29

New File (3).zh 😝

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2023 10:39

I mean a variety of ZScript features and headers have more or less invalidated ghost. NPCAnim handles animations. std has the weapon firing functions. Believe Deedee wrote scripts reproducing all the weapon behaviors for ghost 3.0 if those are absolutely a dealbreaker. The basic movement functions are reproduced in engine now. And ghostBasedMovement has the more complicated walking patterns

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/10/2023 11:03

like honestly I'd rather just make ghost stuff in-engine
fancy weapon movement? in engine would be great for that
you know what that might be my next project

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2023 15:27

(replying to @ Moosh "After Darkmatt pointed out so…"): `std.txt`: I've never once used this, nor updated it. It's still 2.50.2 afaik...and frankly, no, don't care.

`combos.txt` outdated due to `?` buttons

`ffrules.txt` . . . IS JUST A COPY OF FUCKING `ffrules.zh`?????

`__future_logic_diagram.txt` = zoria garbage

`_version_semantics.txt` = could update to reflect our new plans

`zscript_manual.rtf` - where even is this? I don't see it in `/docs`...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2023 15:34

(replying to @ Moosh "# Include:
- REMOVE assert.zh…"): `EmilyMisc.zh` has a bunch of utility stuff of mine. It has:
- Direction-related functions (ex `dirX(DIR_LEFTUP) == DIR_LEFT`, `SpinDir8(DIR_LEFTUP, 2) == DIR_RIGHTUP`, `addX(DIR_UP, DIR_LEFT) == DIR_UPLEFT)`, `addX(DIR_UPRIGHT, DIR_LEFT) == DIR_UPLEFT`)
- Some slightly janky stuff that handles collision checks *using a remote mapdata pointer as the screen to use solidity from*
- `InvVectorX`/`InvVectorY`, taking a deltax/deltay and angle (returning the length of the diagonal line)
- `TriangleRectCollision`, `lineRectIntersect`, `pointTriangleCollision` as new collision checkers
- fake ffc solidity lol, that is outdated
- `DrawStrings`, which does `DrawString`, but wraps at a certain width, and respects `\n` characters.
- `item_tile`, `item_cset` which use `Game->Time` as an aclk and return the item's current tile/cset based on that clock (allowing you to easily draw items that animate without needing to do math yourself or spawn actual items)
most of this is still pretty useful

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2023 15:38

(replying to @ Moosh "# std_zh:
Zoria apparently us…"): - `dmapgrid.zh` stuff is useful as long as it works. Probably wanna test
- `std_platform.zh` seems to conflict with `std_sideview.zh`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2023 15:39

(replying to @ Moosh "# Headers:
- REMOVE ghost2.zh…"): `gui.zh` isn't mine afaik lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2023 15:40

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Why we have a `headers` and a…"): `include` is like, stuff we support to include by default. `headers` is basically popular database stuff that we do not support ourselves (i.e. you have a problem with it, go talk to the author on pzc)
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "you know what that might be m…"): OOOOH FANCY, 100% agree that that's a great idea

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2023 22:35

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "`EmilyMisc.zh` has a bunch of…"): Okay that does sound useful then. Should probably be merged into std instead of isolated to a random header with your name on it then. Because just looking at it my immediate assumption was "Oh this is probably old stuff"
like if I packaged Moosh.zh with ZC...lord

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2023 22:35

(replying to @ Moosh "Okay that does sound useful t…"): Lol, it was my database header for any of my random shit
Also MooshDrawTile is in EmilyMisc.zh

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2023 22:36

lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2023 22:36

Which I love that that isn't even needed
Because of the fucking
-777 or whatever the fuck

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2023 22:37

Will probably leave it for now and merge the useful stuff when I do my std cleanup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2023 22:37

Yeah, feel free
Also #deleted-channel is relevant

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2023 22:44

(replying to @ Moosh "like if I packaged Moosh.zh w…"): man, I should put DEATHWORM in std...

 /s

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2023 22:55

also moosh
why is this thread
in the archive thing
#deleted-channel
no wonder I couldn't find it when I wanted to look back at it and it didn't have an unread message lol
@ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2023 23:09

ughhh 🤦‍♂️

=== @ Moosh 10/10/2023 23:10

because this server is too big and confusing for its own good and I didn't expect there to be two channels dedicated to dev notes / couldn't find the other one amongst the clutter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2023 23:11

there's 2 for dev notes, bug reports, and feature requests
because we used to use threads
but now we use forum channels
so the old threads are archived
don't post anything in a category with `archive` in the name, lol
also, unclutter your channel list
the `Browse Channels` button exists for a reason
