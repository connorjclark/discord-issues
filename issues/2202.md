For alphas, rename Convey Down/Left/Right combo types to Convey Down/Left/Right (Deprecated) because all four conveyor combos can convey in any direction. Doing this would... convey this new feature to ZQ users better. Also, possibly put a zz in front of them to make them go to the bottom of the list.

For betas, hide them from the list (like NPC Guys in the enemy list in 2.53)

This is bad because of existing quests
if we were to remove it from the list, we would need to update old combos on load to change their type
....which, would break any 2.50.2 scripts reading that combo's type and using it for anything
so, due to 2.50.2 having zscript, this cannot be done

It wouldn't be removed literally, it just wouldn't show up in the list of combo types to select from

Like how you couldn't place a Guy in the enemy list or edit one in the Enemy Editor, but they still existed in the .qst's data and while playing the quest

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "It wouldn't be removed litera…"): yes, so what would happen if you open a combo with that type in the combo editor?
and especially what if you do so and then *want an old script to keep working*
breaks everything
Making something not available be available is easy
Making something that was available no longer available is majorly compat breaking
so, no, NO combo types will be being removed in any way
until we reach a version where we are willing to break compat
