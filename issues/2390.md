If you highlight a number of combos and press I, you will be given the option to insert X number of new combos. The same is not try for remove. Highlighting a block of combos still will only prompt you to remove the very first combo, making mass removal an incredibly tedious process. Would be great if the behaviour here mirrored insertion.

Shift + I

Why is this problem like this with tools you can only access through obscure shortcuts and not menus?

no clue lmao

Is there a similar insert / remove hotkey for tiles?

I don't think so; I think you just have to mass move or delete them. I haven't checked though

(replying to @ Moosh "Is there a similar insert / r…"): yes, works identically
*was not always there*, pretty sure I added one of them
