A screen setting that kills every other enemy and projectile once the screen's enemies that are set to beatable are killed. This is to get rid of statues, traps, Bubbles, Zoras, and fireballs in enemy and boss rooms to avoid an unfair death when you think you've beaten the boss. This also makes the boss room non-dangerous to pass through a second time if all the killable enemies are set to not return and thus auto-kill the others upon room entry, which is useful for minibosses without using a DMap Boss Room flag.

(This doesn't apply to damage and Shooter combos, but those can be easily removed via screen secrets)

If this is deemed to be a wasteful use of a flag, a QR could alter the "First Enemy is Ringleader" screen flag to doing this without adding a new flag, since this type of modern design probably would not need to be used by the same old-school quest makers who use Ringleaders.

As for Ring Leaders, imagine a boss that summons enemies and all those enemies should die once the boss is gone - default Ring Leader variant. If changed to the setting requested, all summons must be killed manually to trigger boss defeat sequence. And the same summons are used in the same dungeon as normal enemies. And all 512 enemy IDs are in use.

The solution for normal users is to make a copy of those enemies that doesn't count as defeatable enemies. And also, I'm pretty sure for scripting, you can toggle the "Counts as Beatable Enemy" bool on and off via npc scripts. So make an npc script loaded on those enemies that makes those enemies' beatable flag turned to OFF when in the presence of another certain enemy with ID #XXX (the summoner boss enemy).
Unless that flag isn't writeable, in which case that would be a good feature request of its own.
But I think most normal users who want this room clearance functionality without a script will not be using 512 enemies, either.
