EDIT:  Dragging information from down below up top here.
This bug is present in `A109` and `A111` but **it's fully functional** in `A110`!
------------
In ZC 2.50.2, the designated version to play Panoply of Calatia in, Sideview ladders work fine.  I'm in ZC 2.55 Alpha 111/112, Build 61, from the December 16th build, I'm unable to climb the ladder by pressing [Up] as I can in 2.50.2.  I do not rebind these arrow key controls in either. 

I tested this by staring a new quest file in a newly unpacked zip file in 2.50.2 as well as Alpha 111/112, as well as in the browser version, and setting the controls, starting the quest, and going directly to the screen one screen northeast from where we arrive at the docks when the player has control of the character.  

--------------

Here's the script for CT_Script 4.  It's on line 3,259 in the main script file. 

```// --- Sideview Climbing combos
if (Screen->ComboT[ComboAt(Link->X+7,Link->Y+8)] == CT_SCRIPT4 || Screen->ComboT[ComboAt(Link->X+7,Link->Y+17)] == CT_SCRIPT4){
    if (IsSideview() && FreezeA->Data == 0){
        if (Link->Jump <= 0) Link->Jump = 0;
        if (GetEquipmentA() == 91 && Link->PressA || GetEquipmentB() == 91 && Link->PressB) Link->Jump = 2.5;
        if (GetEquipmentA() == 151 && Link->PressA || GetEquipmentB() == 151 && Link->PressB) Link->Jump = 2.5;
        if (Link->InputUp && Screen->ComboS[ComboAt(Link->X+7,Link->Y-1)] == 0 && Screen->ComboS[ComboAt(Link->X+10,Link->Y-1)] == 0){
            if (Screen->ComboT[ComboAt(Link->X+7,Link->Y+8)] == CT_SCRIPT4 || Screen->ComboT[ComboAt(Link->X+7,Link->Y+15)] == CT_SCRIPT4) Link->Y --;
        }
        if (Link->InputDown && Screen->ComboS[ComboAt(Link->X+7,Link->Y+17)] == 0) Link->Y ++;
    }
}```

Anything else you need, let me know.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:08

Can you try A110 too?
and maybe 109
there's been like 4 changes to input handling between these alphas that could be related
probably side view specific stuff too
so this will give us a range to start a bisect for

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:09

That was next on my list, aye.  Just putting down the beginning of the report.  <:NPCGuideSalute:603063606074015757>

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:10

Thanks!

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:10

At least this is in the very beginning of the quest! üòÜ

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:12

I can climb it just fine in Alpha 106.   Continuing upward...

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:14

Yep, __not__ in 109.  Cannot climb the ladder.  In fact I'm _small Link_ in sideview in 109.
But that's a different topic.  x X.  oof.
And I can walk on water.   I feel like a crackhead.    I'll try it in A110 next.

`A110` is fine!

Trying again in A111 just to see.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:19

So it works in `A110` ... but it _doesn't_  work in `A109` and `A111`.    Interesting.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:21

So, there's a reason you usually go backwards for testing things
...because whatever was wrong in A109 is bugs that were probably fixed months ago

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:21

110-111, thanks üëç

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:22

thanks for the help narrowing it down!

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:22

üôá

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:22

I'm gonna take this opportunity to write my favorite kind of script
A bisect script
Given a replay, type a command and get which commit broke it!
(after waiting and getting some coffee while stuff builds and runs lol)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:23

Should I create and upload a Replay?  It wouldn't be any trouble.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:23

Might be able to use pre builts nightlies to speed up
That's be helpful! For 109

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:23

Coolcool.  Will do.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:23

err, 110?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:23

Turn on debug mode plz
110
Right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:24

109 was buggy as hell so that wouldn't be a useful replay lol

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:24

Ah alrighty.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:24

wait is there even a replay feature back then
I have no idea

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:24

In A110, sure seems to be!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:24

great
Feels like that was way too long ago

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:25

haha lol

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:25

Oh heck I have a 111/112 build in my 110 folder.  Gimme a moment.  I never know what Alpha is in what folder until I unzip it in a place and go into the About pane.
Is there a way to tell what Alpha I'm downloading from the nightlies before I start the download?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:26

?
if you're grabbing nightlies from here
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:27

I ended up with an 111 Alpha in a folder I had named 110 because I only have a date to go by

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:27

...they are in order

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:27

I'm going by what's in the #deleted-channel  channel.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:27

use https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:27

So I should go to the Releases page there instead.  Sounds good.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:27

...which is what that links to anyway

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:27

We should put the version number in launcher maybe
In the corner

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:27

that's not their issue
but anyway, as for "just a date to go by"
you can check the date of A111
anything after is is.... after it
and anything before it is..... before it.
That would be how dates work.
This
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases?q=prerelease%3Afalse

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:28

I guess it's impossible to put the Alpha name in the name of the nightlies, but alright.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:29

I mean, we COULD
but that's a lot of extra crap in the filenames that are already pretty long

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:29

Four characters?   A110?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:29

and it would.... probably need to read the metadata from one of the code files to generate that?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:29

I don't know how it works of course.  Nevermind.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:29

it would need to scan a text file
looking for `#define V_ZC_ALPHA (number)`
regex-extract that number
and then do shit with that
it's not as simple as `name += "A110/A111"`
the build script simply *doesn't know* what alpha the nightly is related to
....not impossible, but, not simple
and if you look on the release page, they are *in order*
and that order is by definition correct

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:31

I've got a build from 10-22-22.  It's the  nightly immediately before Alpha 111 was announced.  I'll see if that'll do it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:33

I would wager a guess
that builds before `10-18-22` will work
and builds after won't

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:33

Yep, it still works in the (true) Alpha 110.
Ooh I'll try both of those.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:34


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053433306475155456/1053439971232583711/image.png?ex=65eb926d&is=65d91d6d&hm=c3d64bc9aed0673d555b4dc3b00e9f7dc3457e2b1f8f2df983f6ac18b7b134f8&)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:34

So the 10-22-22 build _does work_ with these ladders in the quest.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:34

....OH?
that's nice

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:34

I'll try it with one before 10-18.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:34

if 10-22 worked then it wasn't the initial fix for control state stuff

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:35

Shall I try one from October 4th?  It was the one immediately after Replays were announced.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:35

err, did you test A111 itself?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:35

Yep.  Didn't work.  It's why I made this report.
Same with the Browser version.  Didn't work there either.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:35

....but the 10-22 nightly did???

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:35

Somehow, yes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:35

That's an EXTREMELY narrow window
it would have to be one of these 4 changes
....the first only affects github build scripts, not zc code
the second is literally a debug trace

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:36

I'll try one of the earlier A111 builds.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:36

.....the third.... only affects enemy code.....

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:36

I'll try one from November 1st.  Or around that date.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:37

...........and the fourth is just a changelog. WTF?
It should not be possible for 10-22 to work but A111 to not
nothing actually changed about the ZC code between those builds

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:39

oh wait

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053433306475155456/1053441161420869692/image.png?ex=65eb9388&is=65d91e88&hm=e42e0d50c6d9dec5c6966c5e97ed79cf60a00d668dcab68314ac868df98121a6&)
github is smart and has 2 separate `Oct 22, 2022` headers. WTF?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:39

It does work in the November 3rd nightly.
Suggested nightly to try next?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:40

...how did it not work in A111? I'm super confused about that
but whatever, guess it doesn't matter

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:40

November 3rd is within the scope of A111 I think.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:40

huh?
....If I say `A111`, I mean `A111`, not any nightly

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:40

This is the announced version of A111 yes? 
https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876906918847852594/1033807369156694026
So anything going forward is A111.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:41

No
THAT EXACT BUILD
Is A111
Anything going forward is `Nightly A111/A112`

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:41

Aha, alrighty.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:41

which is *not A111*
So when I asked if you tested A111
did you actually test A111?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:42

Apparently just now, and it worked.  So I'll test other A111 builds then.  Glad we're getting closer!
Or at least, here's what I just tested.
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053433306475155456/1053442048092536924/image.png?ex=65eb945c&is=65d91f5c&hm=5810d8c5e9a6e09bb5d372b41b15cae53a759bff01028eaa05efef35fec05686&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:42

ok, yeah, when you said A111 didn't work earlier, that had me looking at commits *Before* Oct 23 only

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:42

I'll go find A111 itself.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:42

so, I was looking in the completely wrong place
.....if it worked in A111
and not in the latest nightly

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:43

My apologies.  I'll try to share that "About" pane with each verson I Test.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:43

then start going backwards from the latest nightly
until it breaks
err rather
until it un-breaks
(and you don't need to let me know every one that doesn't work, only when you find the spot where it changes)
I would wager Dec 13 would contain a possible break
or Dec 5

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:49

It does __not__ work here:

that'll be not fun if so
...though also not *my* problem if so, lol

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:53

I'm trying the build on the 20th next.

It **DOES** work on the 20th.  Going forward one build at a time now.

we've got it narrow
....it's gonna be slopes.
Unless it's one of connor's replay input things

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:55

<:ohshit:358752934097584145>
I'll try one from the 25th next.  There's two from the 22nd or so to try between then.  Watch as it's the last build left for me to try.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:57

ooh there's a 25th? perfect
If that works, it's slopes
if that doesn't, it's connor's replay input stuff
but if you aren't using a replay, it's almost certainly slopes

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 22:58

Nothing to stop me from just repeating it with a replay.  I'll figure it out.  üëç   Going to supper shortly'ish though, probably.  I'll get back to it afterward.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:58

err? Why would you need to repeat it with a replay?
Knowing if it works in the 25th or not is really all we need at this point
<:hugheart:1012188325790089317> thank you for the great help.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 23:00

Of course!
I'm on the ladder.

...wtf,
I selected the 25th.  Gimme a moment.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 23:00

Timezones
That may well be the 25th build lol

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 23:00

I just had a heart attack.
True, as I don't have a 26th build.  Fair.  Ffff.
Okay, so, 25th works.  Keen.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 23:01

err, wait
oh yeah
there is no 25th listed lol
just 26th which is that one
and 27th which is immediately after
.....but if that one works, then uhhhhh
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) you done borked panoply's sideview ladders

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 23:02

I clicked on the top one, to get to the bottom one.  That's what I got.

Fair.  True.  I'm going to go find a bucket of ice water and wear it as a hat for a while.  Don't know how y'all do this for so long.   Going to dinner now.  Ciao!  Happy to help.

(whenever you have time, no rush at all lol)
<:hugheart:1012188325790089317> thanks for the help

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 23:24

...oh wait
........this might have already been fixed, lol
the latest nightly doesn't have Deedee's latest changes
running a new nightly now @ Changeling, see if that fixes it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 23:25

(changes as of today; @ Changeling the browser version was updated last night lol)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 23:35

Amazing.  I'll give it a test in its own folder later.  Thanks muchly!

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/16/2022 23:51

Aww, nope.  D:

Shoot... I need to make it not snap you to the floor if a script is setting Jump to 0 and moving you manually

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 01:40

hmmm, mayhaps if a script moves the player it sets a bool
that bool clears at the end Link::animate
and if that bool is set, snapping doesn't happen?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/17/2022 02:58

fixed; should be in next nightly

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 11:35

Awesome, thanks.  The sooner it's released, the sooner I can continue testing.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/17/2022 19:31

Check back in twenty minutes

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 20:35

Congratulations!  The bug has been fixed!  I thank everyone for their patience.

A lovely fix.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/17/2022 20:58

If you plan on playing this quest, can you record (w/ debug mode on) and add to the #deleted-channel channel when you're done?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 20:59

Mm, sure.
I sure have a doozy incoming shortly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:02

aye, having a full replay of panoply would be good- though if there are any other bugs it that would render the replay not very useful
assuming we can solve any issues, a full replay of that would be GREAT for future automated testing though

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:10

Yep.  What about replays of just the parts with bugs in them?  I don't exactly play in one long session.
I'm in the middle of bug-hunting for one other bug I found.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:10

That's actually the least useful part

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:10

Oof.  Alright.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:10

what we need is to fix any issues with panoply
then, a replay of it that *works*, is used to test for future bugs
(Replays do NOT need to be in one session, though!)
(Recording from a save file, the recording is bound to the save file- it saves whenever you `Save` the quest, and resumes when you reload it)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:12

Sweet.  Alright, then I need to find Alpha 107 and 108 to see if this works.  I'll start a new thread for it later.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:12

old alphas like that are before recording existed, for the record

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:12

I.e.  This particular thing works in 106, but not in 109.  So I'm going backwards from 109 at this point.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:12

recordings need to be made on the latest version to have the proper fixes
....which means any bugs that exist in the latest version will be issues with any recordings.....

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:12

Yep, that's what I'm playing in.  Always migrating up to the latest version as they're released.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2022 21:13

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "I.e.  This particular thing w‚Ä¶"): which thing are you referring to?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 12/17/2022 21:13

I'll start a new thread for it.  May as well discuss it there.
