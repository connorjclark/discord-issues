So you know that thing where there's the CSet 6 dot on the overworld/dungeon map showing which screen that Link is on? That but for the magic mirror's placed return portal, like how you can see it on the map in LTTP. Probably should use a Misc. Color

All subscreen related requests are now automatic red light. Unfortunately, subscreens in ZC is total shit and it requires complete rewriting, which will take ages.

well it's not part of the subscreen editor so i assumed it would be different
