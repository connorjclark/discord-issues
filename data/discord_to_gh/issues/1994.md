As discussed here

The intention of the script is to run during strings (no other script type seems to do so) to check the current message string on screen and runs a save function that _should_ set last/continue screen/dmap to the screen the message is displayed on (the current screen), then save the game

Now that the Cambria contest is over, this isn't too urgent to me. Though I had ideas to improve the script, but I'm still not too sure how timings work. My thought was instead of a `screendata script` activating the script, 1. have the `generic script` run every screen change, 2. Check if the screen has `General Use 1` checked, 3. If not, flag the screen `No Continue Here After Warp` and end, 4. Else if, run the rest of the `generic script saveRoom`, setting all the save stuff to current screen hero/message `const int SV_STRING` is displayed on. Which I think will take care of any other script types running from the generic, which should now be none

"other script types running from generic" is not a thing

=== @ vlamart 11/01/2022 19:07

I guess what I'm trying to say is call a function from the generic in another script like I did with `saveRoom.go()`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2022 19:16

so, here's the important thing about how that works
in ZScript, you are calling a function in the scope of another script.
....in ZASM, you are not doing that at all.
In the ZASM, it's the exact same as if the function were anywhere else.
Every script has its' own copy of every function it calls
including functions called like that
There's absolutely nothing wrong with calling something like that, and it's in fact very good organizationally to be able to do so.
-- As for having it run on every screen change,
Notably, generic scripts can `WaitEvent()` with an event listener for `GENSCR_EVENT_CHANGE_SCREEN`
which would be basically perfect for what you want

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2022 19:21

or, you could just use normal waiting
and set the ReloadState `GENSCR_ST_CHANGE_SCREEN`
which would cause the script to restart from the top of void run any time the screen changes
so, you could have the logic for checking the flags happen first
then go into a while(true)
and it'll jump back to the top every new screen
