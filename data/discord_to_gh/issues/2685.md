When I fill with this combo pool which has a blank combo with a weight of 20 and of a bunch of detail combos with a weight of 1, it will not roll the blank combo because it's the same as the space being filled. Makes it so if I fill a space with low detail and then try and fill it again to add more detail combos, it will not accurately reflect the weighting of the pool.

Actually on second glance it seems it is sometimes rolling that combo but just not using its weight?
(meta) thread name was changed: Filling combo pools ignore weight when replacing a combo in the pool

Where is this weighting code?

=== @ Moosh 09/25/2023 07:14

Appears to be combopool::pick() in combopool.cpp. But looking at it I don't think the weighting code itself is what's doing it...

```        if(!only_cset)
        {
            if((fillscr->data[((sy<<4)+sx)])!=targetcombo)
                return;
        }

        if((fillscr->cset[((sy<<4)+sx)])!=targetcset)
            return;```
fill() in zquest.cpp is running recursively until it hits one of these or fails to pick a combo. So in any case where the combo it's replacing does not change during the replacement, it runs on it again and again until it is or blocks off all paths to it. I think that's what's going on?

Ran into this problem with autocombos, by the look of things I can fix it the same way here...
