Simply requesting the addition of `HEROMV_CAN_WATERDROWN` to prevent the player from drowning in water.  The expected behavior of setting this to `false` is that they would simply walk over water instead.

(deedee did do a LOT of water work, so it's quite possible she might be up for it... if/when she has the energy to do so)
(but, I can't speak for her)

I'm literally faking this by creating a dummy FFC under the player and clearing it when I'm done and it feels bad that I am doing this
"creating"
Commandeering

That is generally the way I'd expect this to be done now
