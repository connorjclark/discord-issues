ASAN output attached.

Repro: just load this screen: `./zplayer -test ~/Downloads/MusicSoundTest/MusicSoundTest.qst 0 64`

Having difficulty getting ZC to run with ASAN. When I run ZPlayer, it gives me a missing DLL error. When I copy over the DLL it closes instantly. When I run it from MSVC it does run but gives a different error on the file select
clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.dll for context

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 06:42

never mind, TIL you can run MSVC's debugger with command line instructions. Huh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 06:50

You should also see it crash just normally in debug or release mode I think
How are you running it? It should be from VS
(replying to @ Moosh "Having difficulty getting ZC…"): Oh, try also giving -s in command line args
The sound system seems to have problems that get in way

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 06:50

yup, figured that out

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 06:51

Which likely explains why in debug mode on OSX sfx are a random hell of random sounds
Also sfx section is always corrupted when saving in debug mode...

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 06:55

Is it actually crashing on the SFX though? I'm getting one when playing the music
oh, but specifically with -s

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 06:56

Oh you know, idk if it crashes if I did -s
Why crash on file select?
Use test mode
That's the repro
Something about starting on that screen was the problem

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 06:57

Yeah that was when I was unable to get it to launch in test mode. Figured that out
I was trying different things just to get it to run

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 06:59

And without -s (that's the one that kills all sound right?) it isn't crashing for me on that screen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 07:04

So just looking at the output I shared
I am AFK rn but...
That second stack trace
Are you setting the pointer to null after it was freed?

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 09:35

I'm really unsure about this one. For one thing, I'm just not able to reproduce the crash. I think what's going on is:
- Triggering the crash was getting pre-empted by another crash (the one to do with -s)
- I fixed that crash
- The fix is stopping the other crash from being reached because ASAN only works with -s

Because I can't trigger the first crash without either hitting or fixing the second crash I don't know what caused that log. Further, looking at the lines in the log I'm not seeing the issue either. Looks like it's saying that `zcmixer_update` was accessing the memory and `unload_alstream_file` is what freed it. But `unload_alstream_file` is being called by `zcmusic_unload_file` which always nulls the pointer. And `zcmixer_update` is only referencing three pointers, one of which is the mixer which is always loaded, the other two are the ZCMUSIC tracks which were nulled by `zcmusic_unload_file`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 17:38

so you've got `zcmixer->newtrack = zcmusic;` and `oldtrack = ` in a few places
I can't reckon how well their lifetimes are managed, since that same pointer is freed elsewhere but not unset from zcmixer afaict
fix is to 1) unset zcmixer-> music's pointers when we delete `zcmusic` or 2) use a shared pointer and move the cleanup code to deconstructor
With above in mind, take another look at the ASAN output and it should be more clear what is happening
we being fast and loose with raw pointers

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 17:41

yeah, sorry this whole thing is kinda a mess. I tried to thoroughly test it, but there's no doubt a hundred better ways I could've been handling this.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 17:43

no need to apologize 🫠 c++ pointers are footguns for sure tho

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 17:44

The idea IIRC was that newtrack is just a shorthand for zcmusic and anywhere that pointer gets updated I was also updating it. This was because I didn't have access to the zcmusic global pointer from within the zcsound project, because it's building a DLL? I think?
So if that was the cause I probably missed a spot

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 17:45

in `void music_stop()` i guess
i see some commented out code related to zcmixer
i guess you need to do an equality test on the old zcmusic pointer first to know which to free?

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 17:47

oh god what have you unearthed there?

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 17:49

fuck that's exactly it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 17:50

so i think you could move to shared_ptr instead
and just delete all the `free(zcmusic`)
and its all good

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 17:50

when I was looking for places zcmusic was being nulled, I overlooked zcmusic_unload_file

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 17:50

no need for a dconstructor now that i think about it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 17:53

errr dont listen to me
too early for me to give good pointer advice lol

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 17:53

lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 17:53

i wonder if there is a way to declare a `unique_ptr` and a non-retaining `shared_ptr` ...
such that clearing the former deletes references of the latter
aka a weak pointer
ya! https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/weak_ptr
love it
so this models what you are doing pretty much

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 17:55

So zcmusic would become a shared pointer and then newtrack would be a weak pointer and therefore always reference the same object as zcmusic?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 17:56

yeah except - when both should exist at the same time....
hmm maybe this wont work - you'd have to have a second toplevel zcmusic pointer reference
just do your raw pointer voodoo

=== @ Moosh 08/27/2023 17:56

it's what I'm "best" at
swear, ZScript is training wheels for real programming except the wheels are a loaded gun and the rest of the bikes parts are also guns

=== @ Moosh 08/28/2023 07:46

k, took care of the thing...like a year later. got distracted by beeg branch feature and some other stuff

=== @ Moosh 08/28/2023 07:47

I also searched for other instances of zcmusic being passed into functions and I think that was the only one. Hopefully that did it and ASAN is happy?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/28/2023 08:05

Looks good now.

=== @ Moosh 08/28/2023 08:05

excellent

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/28/2023 08:05

The existing error for sfx remains a mystery to me

=== @ Moosh 08/28/2023 08:06

And this is only on OSX?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/28/2023 08:08

I've only see it on my mac, only there do I get absolute garbage for SFX
but none of this code is osx specific
so some undefined behavior that msvc is handling better I'd guess
sfx is probably the code I understand the least in all of allegro
mixers are scary

=== @ Moosh 08/28/2023 08:11

Is it all SFX or just on that one screen? Any particular test that breaks?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/28/2023 08:15

It's anything

=== @ Moosh 08/28/2023 08:15

darn

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/28/2023 08:15

Just a constant stream of random sounds effects

=== @ Moosh 08/28/2023 08:15

oh!
well that sounds more likely to be on ZC than on allegro I'd think. So could be good news
