Can we get an option for continuously filling spots, like with the regular pencil? It'd be so handy

?

Flood fill? Hold shift ... Or maybe it is Ctrl

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2024 21:00

its ctrl
though I feel like they are asking for something new about floodfill, not just how to floodfill

=== @ Jared 02/01/2024 21:07

No no I know how to do it
I mean hold down the mouse key to flood fill continuously
Like you do with the pencil except just doing one pixel at a time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2024 21:09

So, this would probably lag a bunch from having to spam the floodfill logic
...hmm, except no, because it checks (or can check) to not do it if the clicked combo is the same.
so, feasible

Isn't he talking about the tile editor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/02/2024 00:26

...oh.
Yeah that is another interpretation which isn't where my brain went
same exact statement goes, feasible

=== @ Jared 02/02/2024 05:46

Lol thank you Majora. Yes it‚Äôs the tile editor. My bad

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/02/2024 05:48

yeah lol. The more specific you can be with a request the better, because it's easy to just not realize that your wording matches multiple things lol

=== @ Jared 02/02/2024 06:23

Sorry bout that Em üòÇ
So is it possible?
