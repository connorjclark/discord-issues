Usually the DS_PHANTOM DrawStyle would give weapon sprites transparency as with draw commands. With the Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing rule on they still do

However when I use the new drawing that allows for scaling and rotation, I get this

Appears to just be averaging the colors with black and completely ignoring whatever's underneath

=== @ Moosh 11/12/2021 10:14

boop

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/12/2021 10:22

gah
you know what's happening?
It's doing the transparency at the wrong step
to a sub-bitmap
which is clear
so it's averaging it with color 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:15

.....yeeeeep, I was correct
blehg
I basically need to rewrite the new sprite draw code, like, almost entirely
god fucking dammit zoria, can't even design something as basic as this correctly....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:26

. . . so the problem is, the cloaked/transparent draw functions used are direct tile draws
I need a version that is a bitmap blit
so it can take the rotated/scaled image as input

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:29

transparent is easy enough, but *cloaked* draws are going to be a fucking pain
because they
are like
```cpp
void overtilecloaked16(BITMAP* dest,int32_t tile,int32_t x,int32_t y,int32_t flip)
{
    if(x<-15 || y<-15)
        return;
        
    if(y > dest->h)
        return;
        
    if(y == dest->h && x > dest->w)
        return;
        
    if(tile<0 || tile>=NEWMAXTILES)
    {
        rectfill(dest,x,y,x+15,y+15,0);
        return;
    }
    
    unpack_tile(newtilebuf, tile, 0, false);
    byte *si = unpackbuf;
    byte *di;
    
    if(flip&1)
        si+=15;
        
    if((flip&2)==0)
    {
        if(y<0)
            si+=(0-y)<<4;
            
        for(int32_t dy=(y<0 ? 0-y : 0); (dy<16)&&(dy+y<dest->h); ++dy)

            di = &(dest->line[y+dy][x<0 ? 0 : x]);

so much memory bullshit that I literally don't know what it's doing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:32

so uh, cloaked is not gonna work right without a lot of work
phantom should be an easy enough fix, though

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 07:42

At least cloaked is the more niche of the two
Though I assume you can't really fix one without also fixing the other, or at least laying down the foundation to do so?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:43

I'm going to make it so if you set it to cloaked it ignores rotation/scaling, for now
(just making it use the old draw code as though the QR were on)
which is simple enough
and *hopefully* I've just fixed the phantom one
as transparency functions are common enough, so shouldn't need anything too fancy, just needed a bit of rearranging

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:49

see if this works?

the fudge
Suppose it's fortunate I made a backup
Yeah this is very broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:59

.....hmmm

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 07:59

Link is invisible and my phantom weapons are showing up cloaked with black flicker

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 07:59

so uh, the title screen is most certainly a separate issue
I noticed some title screen fuck up in a few recent builds
....though that's far worse than what I saw
feel like something to do with modules is fucked up there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:02

.....what the fuck would be making Link invisible, though???

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:03

You just have 1x1 tile link, right?
and, what size are the weapons?

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:05

1x1 weapons. 1x2 Link

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:06

OK, so, I only modified 1x1
so if something's wrong with a 1x2 link
then there's something really weird going on here
maybe it just build-bugged.... let me rebuild clean

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:07

It's all sprites
Enemies are invisible as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:07

what the fuck
literally all I did is make it so in the spot it normally does either `draw tile, draw trans tile, draw cloaked tile`
now it just does `draw tile`
so anything with a drawstyle that isn't phantom/cloaked should be fucking *exactly the same*

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:09

Sounds like this stuff is more complicated than it seemed then?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:09

unless MSVC just decided to fuck up the build
so I'm rebuilding from clean
and hopefully that will magically fix it

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:10

Alrighty then
I take it that's just a thing that happens sometimes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:11

yeah, sometimes
if you think the zscript parser is bad
holy hell
real compilers are shit

still invisible

oh
wait
I'm a fucking dumbass
I see a single tiny fucking typo
uhg

try this
@ Moosh
(ignore the title screen because I haven't touched that)
....wtf discord
`upload failed`

there we go

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:28

uhhh
it's crashing on the title screen for me now
no error, just gone

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:29

what the fuck

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:29

wait run as admin worked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:29

I haven't changed anything related to the title screen
in literally days
so that's all some other unrelated issue
that apparently can randomly crash
ffs

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:29

I mean it's very unstable and apparently reading random data for graphics
so it's not out of the question some of what's causing that could cause random crashes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:30

I don't have any idea why that's doing any of that
it just started doing it a couple days ago
and it probably has something to do with zoria's module bullshit
which frankly never should have fucking touched title screen stuff
jesus

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:31

Anyways, same result
Sprites invisible, ones with phantom are behaving as cloaked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:32

I am *so* confused
I made such a small change
what the fuck

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/13/2021 08:45

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) try building in debug and seeing if things break

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 08:45

1st.qst still draws correctly but I suspect that's just because old sprite drawing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/13/2021 08:45

if not, then it might be debug code that for some reason compiles but screws over release
not sure why that would happen or if that's at all likely

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 08:52

ok

as far as things not being invisible

I see again

OK, thank the lord for my sanity

Yeahh that makes sense

okay, thank god

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 09:01

can you just post your quest file you're testing with, @ Moosh ?
probably easier for me to test things repeatedly at this point instead of posting 50000 builds for you

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 09:01

Sure thing

=== @ Moosh 11/13/2021 09:04

aaaaand it's too big now to send over Discord. shit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 09:04

oof
any chance you could make a smaller test quest that showcases the issues?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 09:13

huh
the title screen thing is based on the last quest you loaded
what the fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 09:50

I WANT TO FUCKING KILL SOMEONE
WHAT THE FUCK
SO
```cpp
if(drawstyle==0 || drawstyle==3) overtile16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));
else if(drawstyle==1) overtiletranslucent16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip),128);
else if(drawstyle==2) overtilecloaked16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));```
this is a code block
it does opaque if drawstyle is 0 or 3
trans if 1
and cloaked if 2
changing it to this
```cpp
overtile16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));
```
makes it not fucking work and everything is invisible
despite that, for a drawstyle of 0 or 3, *it is literally the same fucking block of code*
and ***even fucking stupider***
```cpp
if(drawstyle==0 || drawstyle==3) overtile16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));
else if(drawstyle==1) overtile16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));
else if(drawstyle==2) overtile16(sprBMP,tileToDraw,sx+j*16,sy+(tysz-i-1)*16,cs,((scriptflip > -1) ? scriptflip : flip));
```
this now does the same thing in all 3 ifs
....and THIS ONE FUCKING WORKS??????????????????
WHAT THE FUCK

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 09:54

.....
`if(unsigned(drawstyle) < 4)` does not work
but `if(drawstyle==0||drawstyle==1||drawstyle==2||drawstyle==3)` does
and those are fucking identical logically
what the fuck
what is this cursed bullshit
why

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 10:17

ooookay
finally got it working for all extend values
with enough fiddling with random cursed bullshit

might be hard to tell at a glance, but there's cloaked draws there
and they are working
with new code
