I know you guys have expressed intent to rewrite Zoria's jank entirely but for now it's here and it's mostly working, but the constants he gave in the docs aren't actually in std. Seems like it should be trivial to add those.

It feels dirty every time I enter in a magic number while using these

I don't think the HitBy system is actually terrible an idea; so the implementation will likely remain the same
but yeah, Zoria was terrible with constants
we need to add that
(also I need to add a version for weapons so weapons can detect when they've hit something without looping through every enemy)

Would be neat. Although it's not hard to do that as is. I have a system for my quest
Checks HitBy on enemies in the existing global enemy loop and stuffs the enemy's pointer in one of the weapon's Misc indices
I guess that's technically still looping through enemies, but it was something I'd already be doing to begin with
