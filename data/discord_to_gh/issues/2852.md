The level 1 bracelet item is intended to allow for one use per screen. In 2.55 it instead pushes twice. Not surprised nobody caught this cuz next to nobody uses this item, but I noticed it in NTCC. Here's a sample quest saved in 2.53

Can't bisect further without working out how to build these older commits locally. Is above range enough to help debug? ctrl+f push/glove/block

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 00:23

weird I can't build them either

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 00:34

`UINT64_MAX': undeclared identifier`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 00:44

might've figured out how to compile...
I added ``#define __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS`` to stdint.h
I'm not sure what changed that allowed us to compile back then but not now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 00:48

also getting a bunch of unresolved external signals for zscript stuff

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 00:49

actually wait maybe I'm just dumb and need to build 32 bit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 00:53

okay yeah building 32 bit and including that define seem to be needed
former makes sense, 64 bit came later
but not sure what was including that define before

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 01:07

well I built it but it won't let me even open it...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 01:09

nevermind I forgot older builds couldn't let you just drag and drop the entire folder, had to download a100
probably was included elsewhere too but I forget where

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 01:12

right, it's in output

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 01:47

sigh I hate this, why is compiling old shit hard
```1>C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ZC Dev\2.55 Main\src\ffscript.cpp(10467,12): error C2374: 'indx': redefinition; multiple initialization
1>C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ZC Dev\2.55 Main\src\ffscript.cpp(10450,12): message : see declaration of 'indx'
1>C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ZC Dev\2.55 Main\src\ffscript.cpp(10466,3): error C2360: initialization of 'indx' is skipped by 'case' label```
Okay so it's erroring on this on a different thing (when it didn't error before)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 01:48

no clue why it didn't error here on the last thing I bisected!

why am I even bisecting this
I could probably just spot the issue and blame it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 03:01

got distracted but already found something kinda sus within a minute of actual looking
``(limitedpush && usecounts[itemid] > zc_max(1, glove->misc3)))) continue;`` (that should be a >=)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/19/2023 03:06

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) you dumb
but also how the fuck has nobody found this this has been broken for 2 years

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/19/2023 03:07

aah

=== @ Moosh 11/19/2023 05:33

Virtually nobody used the original item and even fewer used the new feature

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/03/2023 05:33

Was this fixed?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/03/2023 05:35

fixed!
forgot to mark v.v
