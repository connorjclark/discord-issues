Balance issue, Bubbles are kinda useless in A and B quests because of the fact that you can just set weapons to whatever button and get around them.  We might need new enemies (A and B button jinxes) to counteract that.  Whether by editor or script I don't know (or care), but it needs to be addressed.  Definitely not on the priority side, but noted.  Also, potions need to be able to remove these jinxes OBVIOUSLY

You can also post this in #deleted-channel if you are okay with a script too

i thought jinx bubbles affected the sword/item itself, not the button they use

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:32

they do
he's requesting them to affect the button

=== @ Guinevere 10/02/2021 22:34

but he said bubbles are useless for a and b quests because you can get around them by swapping items

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2021 22:34

aye
he's saying that you can just not have a sword equipped, and thus be able to use both buttons still

=== @ Guinevere 10/02/2021 22:34

ahh

=== @ Guinevere 10/02/2021 22:36

having item jinxes instead of sword jinxes also fixes that
but i can see the utility of button disabling jinxes
(might also be beneficial to have x and y jinxes as well)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/02/2021 22:51

yeah i'm sure the enemy can set a status when you touch it where the status disables said buttons' usage
and vice versa for a blue button bubble
i think button disabling is in zscript right?

=== @ Guinevere 10/03/2021 00:19

ye
you could script it where if link gets jinxed, disable so-and-so buttons
