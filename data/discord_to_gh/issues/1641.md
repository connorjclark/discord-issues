I know modules are kinda trash and mostly unsupported, but somebody was asking about changing the title screen graphics and so I took a look at the "default" one for reference on what modules can actually change. There's some quirks with the title screen fadeout but far more noticeable, all the items in the intro scroll draw in the wrong palette. They appear to be using the Zelda 1 palette instead of Koten. Unsure if this is a case of Zoria fucked up and forgot to assign the right palette or Zoria _really_ fucked up and didn't remove some hardcodes.

Is koten loaded into the qst.dat the module uses?
