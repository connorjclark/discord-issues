Right now, we can set the move speed on a slow walk combo, which is great. It would be nice if this option could be added to all combos, so we could have stuff like... bridge combos that are slow walk (for ladders, as example), or slow walking through shallow water.

Insert weirdly appropriate "You're too slow" joke here.

=== @ Russ 05/01/2023 18:35

lol

=== @ P-Tux7 05/01/2023 22:08

does this have any significant use beyond water and bridge combos? it might be better just to put it on combos that need it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 22:09

I mean, wanting to walk slower on "stairs", wanting to walk faster on roads,

=== @ P-Tux7 05/01/2023 22:09

sorry yeah i meant that slow walk (changed to a general walk speed combo) would be included here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 22:10

The idea is basically replacing the need for slow walk combos at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 22:11

I would probably give each combo a `multiplier`, `divisor`, and `adder` for speed
so you could do `2, 3, 0` for `*2/3`

=== @ P-Tux7 05/01/2023 22:13

>negative multipliers

🤢
probably not?

I mean... god, I don't actually see why it wouldn't work, would it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 22:15

And, next question, is layers. Probably, all 7 layers work, and it applies them in order.

oh, err, this was the duplicate
locking as duplicate, further discussion to #2354
