Would be cool if you could set what button you have to press to activate a save point combo, like with sign posts. Being able to display a prompt combo would also be cool, and bring more versatility to the combo type.

yeah a lot of players ive noticed seem to get confused as to how a save combo functions.
and the combo itself isn't really up to par with a lot of the 2.55 niceness imo.

frankly
*I* do not know how a save combo functions
which makes it hard to fancify
