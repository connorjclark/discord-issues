....yep, that definitely was doing a thing that new menus don't support anymore, whoops

simple fix
it was using the return of `onExit()` directly to `D_CLOSE` the menu before; but the menu is now casting the functions to `void` return type as it doesn't use it
so, just has to do similar to `handle_close_button_quit()`.
