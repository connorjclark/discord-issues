Bit of an odd one here, but back in 2.50 attributes 11 and 12 were in the Data 2 tab in the editor and were used by pretty much every ghost.zh script. At some point when attributes got expanded, Zoria moved them over to the new Attributes tab. This has caused a bunch of small inconveniences for users who are familiar with 2.50 or unfamiliar with 2.55, trying to follow older script setup instructions, ect. Would it be possible to restructure the UI again to have them either moved back or accessible from both tabs?
And discord lagged out and double posted the thread. ü§¶ Can someone remove the duplicate?
