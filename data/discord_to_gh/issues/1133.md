Moldorms currently have hardcoded animation - one tile for New Enemy Tiles off, their usual setup for New Enemy Tiles on. You can see that their Animation Style is empty. Requesting a Moldorm animation style (which is 4-frame 8-dir + 2 copy rows) and for this to no longer be linked to the QR
might be useful for scripted enemies to be able to access such a kind of animation too, like emily's splitting moldorm
