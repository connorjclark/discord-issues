Version: 2.55 Alpha 116

Passively running ``generic scripts`` run during the opening wipe after you load the quest from a save file but do not run during the opening wipe after you continue the quest through the continue screen.

```
generic script Foo
{
    void run()
    {
        until(false)
        {
            WaitTo(SCR_TIMING_START_FRAME); //Start of frame timing
            printf("Foo\n");
            Quit();
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}
```
If you set ``[pointer that has Foo loaded]->Running = true`` and then you ``F6->Continue`` immediately afterwards, it will trace ``Foo`` to the console after the opening wipe finishes when you continue.
If you set ``[pointer that has Foo loaded]->Running = true`` and then you ``F6->Save`` immediately afterwards, it will trace ``Foo`` to the console at the beginning of the opening wipe when you load the save file again.
For best results use frame advance to pick out the exact frame to F6.

This appears to be tied to ``SCR_TIMING_START_FRAME``. After setting the timing to ``SCR_TIMING_POST_COMBO_ANIM`` Doing the ``F6->Save`` method traces ``Foo`` to the console after the opening wipe like the ``F6->Continue`` method does .
