This one is a bit hard to explain, but the less time you hold a diagonal direction before firing, the more horizontal/vertical link sprites are used in the chain. If diagonal is held for around a second, all links display correctly as the diagonal variant. The video demonstrates the issue.

For clearer illustration, I swapped out the diagonal chain sprite for Z2 extra life sprites. You can see they only sometimes appear.

I was wondering if there was any update on this. I'm unsure if it got buried or something since it doesn't have any flairs applied yet.

Yeah FWIW the diagonal hookshot is marked as a beta

No update, doubt anyone looked otherwise they would have commented here. Just time constraints, reports don't get overlooked.
This isn't an area I'm familiar with so I've been doing other things.

IIRC Zoria added the diagonal Hookshot
