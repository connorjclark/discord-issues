(replying to @ ChefBear "https://discord.com/channels/…"): I just tested LGA3 (Link's Grand Adventure 3 by Emily) on the latest z3 build and Link is actually invisible now there too
The quests that I have tested are LGA3, The Slipstream, and Dreams Realm. All invisible

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:33

Let's stick to Link to the heaven
So, to summarize, as soon as you gain control of Link (outside that house), he is invisible?
Or is it only entering the house?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:36

Copy your `zc.cfg` file (so you can restore it), and clear it. Does it still happen?
I'm gonna try on my Windows machine now instead of mac.

=== @ ChefBear 01/07/2024 02:36

Yeah gaining control

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:39

Is this `3.0.0-prerelease.21+2024-01-06`?

=== @ ChefBear 01/07/2024 02:40

Yep

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:42

You're on 32bit.
Does it happen for 64 bit? Whats your reason for using 32b?

=== @ ChefBear 01/07/2024 02:43

Oh I just assumed I should use x86 because my program files folder has (x86)
I'll try the other one

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:43

nah, the only reason to use 32 bit is if you are on a 32 bit machine
or if a software has no 64 bit version

=== @ ChefBear 01/07/2024 02:44

TIL read x86 as 32 bit 👍

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:44

Did you notice the warning you get when opening that? 😛

=== @ ChefBear 01/07/2024 02:44

Yeah, I assumed that message just showed regardless hah
But thought it was weird yea

=== @ ChefBear 01/07/2024 02:46

Embarassing...

Case closed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:47

sigh, not quite
while I'd love to stop supporting win32, we still do for now so we don't alienate some of the oldest players

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:48

(meta) thread name was changed: Hero Is Invisible in ZC Player (Still Visible in Test Mode) (win32)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 02:58

Finally reproduced, except only from a published release not a local build.

=== @ ChefBear 01/07/2024 03:08

Ah, I assumed it was just a bad interaction bw 32 but ZC and my pc. GL 🫡

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 03:31

(replying to @ ChefBear "Oh I just assumed I should us…"): you have `Program Files` and `Program Files (x86)`, yeah?
that's because the x86 is for older (32-bit) programs
and the one without a label is for normal (64-bit) programs

=== @ ChefBear 01/07/2024 03:34

Noted!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 04:47

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "bisected https://github.com/Z…"): huh... I honestly am not sure there....

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 05:02

i can reproduce locally. had to be RelWithDebInfo
so, where should I look? what things normally hide the player

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 05:04

The player tile modifier could be wrong, offsetting to display the wrong tiles (which could be blank), if something is wrong with owned items
the player could... be set to be invisible
the player could have a ScriptTile that is >-1, overriding the tile they draw, which could be to a blank tile

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 05:05

y is super negative
120, -189
somehow sy -= fakez(fakez) does that lol
before y was 0

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 05:09

this make no sense

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1193381178716196864/1193421189759123597/image.png?ex=65e40618&is=65d19118&hm=ca44177e6b3a218417b87d628a42b835517a0aea0325767935f8276141565fbe&)
fakez is 0
sy is 0
but after this line, sy is -189
is this a compiler bug
do I really need to read assembly now
uggggh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 05:11

fuck

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/07/2024 05:24

what is fake_z(fakez)? I wrote that line but I did that because I was copying what the other stuff was doing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 05:28

it just calls `fakez.getInt()`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 05:30

when it returns from vbound, the result is fine. it's zero (eax).

what follows must be this
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1193381178716196864/1193426486762405899/image.png?ex=65e40b07&is=65d19607&hm=2670c40d391bb51e452b047689ff42422e4032d3cf09451e16901f416fb23400&)
by end, it become 189...
so this code for dividing by 10000 must be flawed..

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 06:00

this prevents issue

this too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/07/2024 06:02

the fuck is wrong with this compiler lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 06:02

it was somehow flipping the signs...even tho the result of "syz" was zero.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 06:04

fine:
