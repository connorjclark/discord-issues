okay so first open this quest

it's a 1.90 tileset saved in 2.55
and go to sprite data and open one of the sprites, then go to pick a tile for it
at that screen, press escape to back out of it, then again to back out of the sprite, then again to back out of the sprite list
all the combos are blanked out

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 03:38

wait what the absolute fuck
no
just OPENING and picking a tile for a sprite in that dialog causes all the combos to be blanked out

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 03:39

ok so it doesn't happen with new/qst.dat quests
but it does happen with this imported quest

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 03:42

this happens with ANY misc. sprite - ones that are already in the quest (arrow projectile sprite), and others that are not (magic meter)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:40

?
hmmm
I don't see anything happening @ P-Tux7
oh wait
it doesn't happen until the dialog closes
duh
ummmmmmmmmmmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:43

Guessing this is OriginalTile related, somehow

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:43

ok so good news and bad news

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:43

and probably version check related on quest load

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:43

this does not happen with 1.92 tilesets

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:44

I think I remember deedee mentioning something about 1.90 quest loading being weird
it probably has a separate block that wasn't handled

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:44

the bad news is that this happens even with an unmodified revenge 2 tileset
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=tilesets&id=7

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:44

it probably would happen to ANY 1.90 quest

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:44

yeah the good news here is that saving a 1.90 quest in 2.55 isn't what's fucking it up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:44

for the record, the sprite data has very little to do with it

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:44

so it's not permanently borked unless you save the quest AFTER that happens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:44

it's just when it tries to reset all combo animations
it reads every combo as having an original tile of 0
so it

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:45

oh haha those didn't EXIST in 1.90

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:45

resets them all to 0
it should be copying the tile to the originaltile
on quest load
but clearly it's doing something weird for 1.90 right now

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:45

hold on lemme grab a 1.84 quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:46

`if( version < 0x192 )`
guessing that's the culprit

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:46

yup happens in this too

....hmmm
doesn't seem to have fixed it, actually

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:50

oh, wait
you re-saved this in 2.55 didn't you
uhg

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:51

oh nah that's not the issue
i linked you the original 1.90 tileset
and a 1.84 quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:52

the `typeb.qst`?

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:52

opening them and then closing out of the sprite dialog after selecting a tile does it *whether or not* you saved it in 2.55
oh yeah i did that one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:52

so that matters

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:52

but if you download example_bs1st and try it, you'll find the same happens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:52

but my point is
what I just did the first time
should fix the ones that were original

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:53

ah good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:53

but doesn't fix the one that was resaved

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:53

no problem i just started on it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:53

no, but, other people could have the same bug
so I need to fix it
gimme a minute

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 06:53

(one of my friends suggested to save the 1.90 quest in 2.50, and that fixed it for 2.55 usage as well)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 06:54

viola, fixed
