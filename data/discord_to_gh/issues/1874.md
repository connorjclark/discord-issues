Whereas pressing [i] on the Combo Pages will nudge a blank combo where the cursor is, there are plenty of opportunities in tilesets to have to add more spaces, but doing it one at a time is tedious.

Being able to add a lot of spaces all at once would be extremely, extremely useful and time-saving.  Perhaps holding [shift]+[i] would be useful.

The question is, should it add a specific amount of combos, or should it open a dialogue to ask for a number of combos to add?

(Bonus addition:  A visual multiplier that shows us when the number we've typed is a multiple of 4.)

Just open the combo page and select a group of combos and press i, does the same thing I think

Oh neat, it does work.
Good catch.
A little hackish, but it works.
