This video kinda speaks for itself and yes I'm pretty sure I have Moosh's scripted ALTTP doors set up correctly as well as ensuring that everything else is set up correctly, but it's not letting me go south.

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "This video kinda speaks for i…"): is `Solid` checked on the door?
(I'm guessing that script probably was NOT designed with ffc solidity in mind...)

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/22/2023 00:16

I can check but I don't think solidity is checked on the door

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2023 00:18

@ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2023 00:20

What is even going on here!?
This doesn't even look like ZC's solidity behavior at all
Does it do this if you place down just the open door combos in that slot?

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/22/2023 02:10

hold on
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) can confirm that solidity is not checked

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/22/2023 02:14

@ Moosh can confirm that the problem persist even if it's just the open door combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2023 02:14

ok, are you using `Newer Player Movement`, and if so, when is the last time you updated?

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/22/2023 02:15

I updated earlier today, when the latest nightly dropped

=== @ Moosh 10/22/2023 02:15

better yet, he can just post a QR string to get all the movement QR related stuff right?

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/22/2023 02:16

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) yes I am using Newer Player Movement

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) yes I a…"): when did you last update
(The report info in `About` is more useful than the qr string)

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/22/2023 02:18

the fuck

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/22/2023 02:19

would it help if I privately DMed you the current build of my quest?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2023 02:28

moosh not me lol, I'm burned out

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/23/2023 01:52

The problem still persists on the latest nightly

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 02:18

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "The problem still persists on…"): It's  not related to my door script. Newer player movement just appears to be broken at the moment, if you want one tile gaps to function, turn that rule off for the time being and we'll let you know when it's fixed

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/23/2023 02:19

aye

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 02:20

...Did I fuck up a qst.cpp thing?
...well, it should be default-constructed in init data
so it shouldn't need an explicit check
When loading an old quest, what is the `Shove Offset` in init data?

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 02:21

It happens in a new quest. In this screenshot, the two corner tiles are using solid FFCs and the gap works. The rest is placed combos and does not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/23/2023 02:22

(replying to @ Moosh "It happens in a new quest. In…"): ...the fuck, it ONLY works for solid ffcs?

=== @ Moosh 10/23/2023 02:22

yeah that's what I'm seeing

@ FireSeraphim Checking in, is the fix for this one working?

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/28/2023 08:15

Can confirm the solidity issue has been resolved

=== @ Moosh 10/28/2023 08:33

excellent
