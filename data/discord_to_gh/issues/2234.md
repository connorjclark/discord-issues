as mentioned in #deleted-channel, but posting here for the sake of filing it as a bug report. 11-3 nightly.

full stops cannot be added to d0 or d7, and as such decimal values can't be used. the a1 and a2 slots work fine. first screenshot is alpha 107, second is the latest nightly. exact same demo quest file used by alucard to demonstrate his enemy kill order password script.
