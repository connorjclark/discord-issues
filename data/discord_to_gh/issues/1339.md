Sadly this seems to be one of those crashes that seems to happen randomly, but it's happened twice in two different recent builds in different quests, but the one thing in common was I touched a Cave (Walk Down) combo when the hard crash occurred.
My guess is this is something position based, or maybe something in the code is reading random memory (which is why it doesn't always crash).

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 19:16

I have not experienced this crash in older builds (92 and older), and I do recall an earlier build that had other random ZC crashes, so maybe it's related?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 19:18

For point of reference, the crash has occurred in 99 and 101.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) these alphas were post entrance warp fix, right?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/11/2022 20:15

yeah

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 20:21

Wait, wasn't the broken cave warps 100 though?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 20:26

Meanwhile I forget if it was 97 or 99 that had other crashing bugs (I want to say one happened often on screens with Gleeok?), which got fixed by 100.
When it happened in 99, it was pretty early in a quest so I could get back to the specific screen to see if I could reproduce it, but couldn't. Wasn't sure if it then got fixed along with the other crashes.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 20:28

If it helps, the crash happens before the first frame of the "going down the cave" effect. The SFX does not get a chance to play, and I don't think Link is even drawn under the cave combo yet.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/11/2022 22:01

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Wait, wasn't the broken cave…"): 100 was broken caves yeah
101 is post broken caves

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/11/2022 22:05

So this crash is unrelated to that bug / fix.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/11/2022 22:32

Possibly...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/12/2022 02:46

I'd put it in the `LinkClass::dowarp()` section as a likely bugged area, though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 14:40

@ HeroOfFireZC could you give me some example quests of where this occurs?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:36

It's happened in my own quests (I usually play them first in a new build)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:37

Happened in Mirage Island after an hours, and Turtles Hate Candy after 15 minutes. And if you recall, Mirage Island is a 256 screen overworld with a ton of caves, so the fact it only crashed entering a cave after an hour and not the first 5 or so is annoying to pin down.
On the other hand, has *not* crashed testing DDD, which has *zero* Walk Up/Down caves.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 17:38

hmmm
might need to hook up a debugger and play around for a bit until a crash happens
not the *worst*, as long as that crash eventually happens

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:39

Also, this was fairy recent. In a prior build I was playing through some older randos (also cave happy), and had zero crashes there.
Actually, hold on, let me see if I can confirm those versions (though if this is super random, those versions may still have this bug)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:42

Okay, first off, the first crash was in Alpha 99, Build 61
Oh, that number means nothing for nightlys....
Uh, so, the version with 16+ hours of gameplay an no crashes was Nov 14 build.
Wait....
The first crashing build was Oct 21. *Before* that other build.
And then the 101 build with the other crash Jan 9.
So I guess I got *really* lucky in that Nov 14 build?
Let me glance at one other thing here quick....

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:47

Okay, has nothing to do with the entrance type, both cases were different warp types.
(was wondering if the reason I dodged it in that one version was having a lot of generic screen 80 caves)
(and if both cases were a specific type, like Entrance / Exit or something)
So..... where does this leave this. Seems like something involving random memory, given how inconsistent it is.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 17:49

latest version of mirageisland off Pure?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:49

Yep.
I think Turtles is the same, that one was the Level 2 entrance, which made be briefly think it had to do with screen secrets spawning the cave hitbox over me, but that does not seem to be the case.
Since that one was so early in the quest, I actually started the run over, saved when I could access that cave entrance, and tried entering it differently several times, no crashes.
But then again, all the caves in Mirage Island are the Z1 style, it's nearly impossible to approach those combos from a weird angle anyways.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 17:53

Right now this just appears to be very random chance, I wonder if it can happen in *any* quest or if there is some specific rule tripping it.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/13/2022 18:08

One thing I can think of these quests have in common, both were last saved in 2.52. I doubt that is the cause, but just in case...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 22:19

4 hours and I have yet to crash
I'm hoping I either fixed the bug, or I run into the crash sooner rather than later

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 11:03

finished a run, no crash

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2022 16:42

Given what was discussed, and how I had about 10+ hours between two randos with plenty of caves with no crashes, yet clearly in a version that exists between the two I have encountered the crash in, it does seem very random.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 16:43

@ HeroOfFireZC if you run into it in the upcoming alpha, let me know

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2022 16:43

But looking at the code related to caves, there doesn't seem to be any clear issue?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 16:43

I'll probably start testing in older versions
If I can recreate it there, I might be able to figure out if it's a thing we fixed or not

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2022 16:47

Just trying to figure out how to narrow down the issue. It's  Hard Crash, so that should limit it to certain kinds of issues. It's really random, so random memory access seems like the most likely cause.
The last hard crash bad memory access issue was a thing in zQuest where the "hitbox" for color replacing was a bit too large, letting you go out of bounds of an array.
Which meant how consistent it was had to do with a combination of zQuest version and my comp, others could have done the same thing and not seemed to crash.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2022 16:51

I guess one thing to look at. If you have an idea what code is being called the first frame you touch a walk-down cave combo, compare it between current versions and earlier alphas, like 92. See if anything has changed.
(I have used and played on 92 for a *long* time with no crashes, so it seems safe to assume the crash was introduced since then)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 16:53

so it's specifically the first frame that causes the crash?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/14/2022 16:55

It seems to be. I don't hear the stepping SFX or see LInk drawn below the combo, but the crash happened when really close to a cave, most likely when touching it that the next frame would have me performing the cave entering state.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:00

@ HeroOfFireZC new alpha is out; please let me know if you run into the crash again in the alpha
