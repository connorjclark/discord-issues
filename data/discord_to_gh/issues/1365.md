By standalone I mean Digdogger Kids 1-4 that you place in the room. And Gohmas 3 and 4 only, not Red and Blue. This is also in reference to the normal enemy respawn system - they will not respawn if they are in a boss room, of course. But if you place them outside of one, they will respawn.

(Ignore the Patras - they should not respawn in either version, I was just checking them)
I know this behaviour dates back to 1.92 as well, but I wonder if more enemies respawn in that version so I will have to check. I recall that Patra 3s were not on the Do Not Respawn list in the B114 source code.
