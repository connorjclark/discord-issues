I cannot maintain a visibly smooth 60 FPS. I either get jittery visuals like choppy scrolling, or the framerate randomly drops to 30 FPS and the game runs at double speed.

I'm getting the random '30 fps and double speed' issue even on windowed now

ZC version?
Does changing to OpenGL driver (see launcher) help? `[graphics] driver = 2` i believe is the cfg value, not sure when we added the option to change the driver in the Launcher

=== @ RetroNutcase 06/19/2023 07:14

Lemme try that.
OpenGL doesn't seem to help, unfortunately

=== @ RetroNutcase 06/19/2023 07:16

The weird frameskip+speedup issue seemed to be because I used my old config and some features I don't think are supported anymore, like triple buffering.

=== @ RetroNutcase 06/19/2023 07:17

As for version:

Hm, Fullscreen OpenGL does seem to be cooperating.
And I'm not getting that speedup problem anymore. Definitely thinking my old config borked things when I tried some of the stuff from it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/19/2023 15:56

Odd. now-unused config options obviously shouldn't have any effect, so I'm wondering what else was in your config. If you still have it, can you share it?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 20:55

@ RetroNutcase did every quest do this, even classic 1st?
I would still like your config file.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 20:57

(replying to @ RetroNutcase "https://clips.twitch.tv/Court…"): which quest is this

=== @ RetroNutcase 07/01/2023 21:20

Randomizer omega. And sadly that config file's been nuked.
But I think it was said config that was the culprit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/01/2023 21:24

Any chance you had the zscript debugger on?

```
[CONSOLE]
ZScript_Debugger = 1
```
I see mega-FPS drops with that on, when the debug window gets chatty.
If this was on, it would have been open in the background (if you were in fullscreen), or visible besides the game (if windowed).

I occasionally run a profiler on zplayer/zquest and fix the slowest things I find. As there is no specific thing here and its ongoing, going to close.
