When I rightclick in the item editor in Zquest, it opens up the menu, but when I try to select anything, it closes the entire item editor.
This happens in both the item editor window and select item window.
Using July 9 nightly

This was reported before, and I reproduced it ONCE, and then stopped being able to reproduce it at all...
(yes it was that menu being referred to, @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) )

Maybe specific to your qst file @ Tabletpillow can you provide?
And which item does it happen on

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/09/2023 20:58

That's surprising.
I opened a new quest file and it didn't work.
The bug I meant.
So it might be quest exclusive.
Wait. Now it works normally in my quest, too
Sometimes it does it, sometimes it doesn't.

It's inconsistent as hell

=== @ Tabletpillow 07/09/2023 21:00

Yeah idk how to replicate it now.

OK, let us know if you see it again.
