Once cheats are on, you can decrease the cheat level by entering a lower level cheat, but there's afaik no way to go from cheat level 1 to 0, barring scripts. Would be neat if entering an invalid code did it, or an option in the dropdown

Pfft
The dev menu actually can do this already
(Because you just enter any number 0-4 to force cheat level)
I could probably make a menu that let's you do the same, up to the max level code you've entered?
Or, better yet, revamp the cheat dialog entirely

Could be cool. So long as hotkeys remain the same. F11, H, G, and the layer disabling ones are my lifeblood
But a lot of the time I'll use cheats to give myself some items and the only way to turn it off again is to F6 save, which isn't always ideal
hence the request

I'm thinking, a box to type code in, with a check button
And a radiolist of 0,1,2,3,4
Grey out the radio buttons higher than the highest code checked
Give ZScript access as `Game->MaxCheat`, probably?

This makes sense, though I wonder if quests would use it
back in the day when quests occasionally gave out lower level cheats I wondered why it wasn't more customizable. Now it seems to be L4, quest password, or nothing

Looking good

How does it function with reading/setting cheats via script? Returns the currently selected radio button?
Would writing cheat level 4 also update the max cheat?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 00:11

Reading `Game->Cheat` gives the selected
If you write it higher than max cheat, max cheat matches
If you write max cheat under cheat, it pulls cheat down

=== @ Moosh 02/16/2022 00:12

eeexcellent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2022 00:13

The "cheats used" state of the save file is set as soon as Cheat is >0
Max cheat does *not* affect this
So even if you enter a cheat code, as long as you leave it on level 0, it won't mark you as having used cheats.
