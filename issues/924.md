Match three enemies up and a secret trigger activates. These are based on the enemies seen in Tail Cave Links Awakening.

This should be a script. Not happening in-engine.

hmm... I could see this happening maybe. No promises though.

No new enemy types in engine.

not happening until rewrite
just fuck no
I fucked with enemies enough
to learn that it just is NOT fucking happening

I took a look at it, in hindsight this is a terrible idea for us to do right now
Though, I could write up an npc script that does this at some point.

A script for this would be not that bad
I'd probably make it so you place a single npc, and it spawns 2 "children", doing code to link them

Imagine those enemies, but symblos change very fast, like in real slot machine. And getting mismatched combination lesults in Link getting struck by lightning for full heart in damage.
