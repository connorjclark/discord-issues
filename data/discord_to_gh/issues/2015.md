Yeah so I basically have this already mostly done
I want to safety proof it though
currently there's two modes for remembering the position; one where it remembers the topleft position, and one where it remembers the center position
I can't even remember why I did the two modes; I figured just in case one didn't work with scaling the other one might work better?

```const HWND hDesktop = GetDesktopWindow();
    GetWindowRect(hDesktop, &desktop);
    int rightmost = desktop.right - 1;
    int bottommost = desktop.bottom - 1;``` This code also seems to work on windows
(though I need to adjust the safety of it more so the window bare is always onscreen)
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) does this code work outside of Windows?

Top left seems good
If you're not using the Allegra APIs then no this isn't portable
HWND is windows.

ahhh...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 16:52

Use allegro instead they have apis for this

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Use allegro instead they have‚Ä¶"): Closest I can find is ``a5_sys_get_desktop_resolution(int *width, int *height)``
which is found in a5_system.c
Do I import a5_system.c or do I import a different file to use it?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 18:27

nevermind, think I figured it out

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:37

mhmmm you want `al_*` functions

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/09/2022 18:37

```ALLEGRO_MONITOR_INFO info;

    al_get_monitor_info(0, &info);
    rightmost = info.x2 - info.x1;
    bottommost = info.y2 - info.y1;``` I went with this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:37

Should be no need to import anything, if there is just import zc_alleg.h
yeah
that looks right.
Pretty similar to windows code üòõ
`a5_*` and `all_*` are just allegro legacy stuff

I capped it between 0 and screen edge - 48

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 18:38

mostly, you want to avoid those

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) close this if it's done?
