Long story here, but reproducable

=== @ NightmareJames 10/18/2021 19:06

You get to Level 1, I put in now completely non-teleporting  teleporting Wizzrobes with the Red Wizzrobes on Form 1, message plays before.  You go to the Blue Gohma, Form 2.  Intentionally die (or die or whatever).  You come back to the boss room and you get a shopkeeper and you can't advance, plain and simple

@ 4matsy @ naturesucks were in attendance on the stream when this ugliness happened

=== @ tim 10/18/2021 19:17

yeah this was a weird one

=== @ NightmareJames 10/21/2021 12:17

Still occuring in the latest nightly @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) .  Hate to do this with your workload, but tagging you on this too @ Moosh since this deals with scripting
Just wondering when there will be an estimated timetable for look at or fix so I don't be a pain in the ass about it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 14:07

...no one posted here saying it was worked on at all, @ DeletedUser . No need to ping.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/21/2021 14:09

OK.  Estimated time?

=== @ NightmareJames 10/21/2021 14:11

LMK when you start looking at it then, I'll work on other stuff and post an update then on the project forum
God I hate phone keypads
Thank you in advance

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 12:45

what the fuck.
this is really bizarre

=== @ NightmareJames 02/09/2022 21:20

Yeah, it is
Do you want me to retry in latest alpha?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 23:42

I already tried, it still exists

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 08:30

This might have been broken this whole time; it was accessing random memory and presumably the reason it was never caught was cause shopkeepers couldn't be spawned in engine probably
either that, or the random memory pointed elsewhere
(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìDemo ZX - Shopkeeper appears when you kill a Gohma form
Fixed now

=== @ NightmareJames 02/12/2022 10:15

Go fig, test it out by Monday, have CD today, and work too
TY

=== @ NightmareJames 02/17/2022 02:07

This is fixed in test mode using a recompile, will make a formal test soon

=== @ NightmareJames 02/21/2022 00:21

=== @ NightmareJames 02/23/2022 20:48

=== @ NightmareJames 03/03/2022 01:50

Unarchiving to keep a personal reminder
