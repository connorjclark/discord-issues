Inspired by @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 's new QR to make sideview swimming only let the player face left and right. This is the same thing but for sideview. The one exception would be if the player is using a sideview ladder, where the up and down directions would be allowed, and only up would be allowed if the "Force Player to Face Up on Sideview Ladders" QR is checked. I presume the up and down directions would be allowed in the cases of Ladders and Rafts as well, as well as the Spin Attack/Hurricane spin.
This was inspired by TheRock's Mario quest.

Wouldnt be hard to do

@ Architect Abdiel does this sound good to you

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/20/2021 17:55

I don't really understand.
Wait. I think I get it. So the QR would just be for sideview in addition to sideview swimming.

Yeah
This also means that you can make Gohmas that need you to be on a sideview ladder or the item Ladder to shoot them
You can also use Boomerangs in new ways, since they're one of the only weapons you can aim up, down, or diagonal while facing left or right.
To hit crystal switches, combo flag switches, break customized bush combos, or kill enemies
This also applies to all other items while you are on a sideview ladder or item Ladder, such as only being able to shoot the arrows or wand up and down to hit the above mentioned things while on one of those ladders. There's a lot of puzzle potential there

Or using the hookshot up/down while on a ladder, or using the hammer up/down while on a ladder...

=== @ P-Tux7 10/20/2021 19:49

(Don't forget the many newly hookshottable things - bush combos, pushblocks, magic sponges/prisms, hammer pegs, treasure chests...)
Oh yeah and you can make signposts/npcs and treasure chests openable from the left/right as well. So you can have truly sideview chests like Mario 3.
(Or use the downwards-facing ones in a puzzle, hahaha...)

That's right, if this rule gets added you can be that evil all without scripting.

=== @ Architect Abdiel 10/20/2021 21:03

I like it.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ... was this added yet? We need to do some testing in the sideview engine regarding Castlevania stairs, since IIRC they used up/down

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/05/2021 11:34

Not yet

=== @ P-Tux7 11/05/2021 14:01

np
just asking in case we had to get to testing it
