There should be an options to set up combos that can damage the player as Torches that light up a room also.  This would be mainly fires on the ground as seen by old men in caves if you use fire by itself alone as a tile in dungeons or map screens etc.

I cannot set it as a torch and as a Damage Combo, it takes up that option to do so.
Maybe a checkbox for torch idk.

Or new rule maybe.

Can you not just layer one under the other?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/21/2021 00:57

Huh?
Actually Damage Combos with torch effect might be the easiest new type to make.
.
Does torch work on overlayer torches?

i'm not sure but i do know damage combos work on overlayers

`make one combo to the work of two combos` is a feature request that is never going to happen
there are only so many attributes on combos
layers exist for a reason
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîíTorch Option for Damage Combos
