Basically just a quality of life tool for when you're working with more detailed tilesets. The user defines in a combo's properties that when being placed in the editor, there is a chance it will be replaced by one of 15 other defined combos. The frequency at which any detail tile appears can be manipulated by the user with a simple percentage value.

Under the hood, ZQ generates a random 11x16 matrix for every screen with values ranging from 0 to 15 across all entries.  Each value corresponds to one of the defined replacement tiles, with 0 being the parent tile and the modal value across all entries in the matrix.

What this feature can be used for is for detailing things like grass tiles. It can save time since the user doesn't have to go back and manually sprinkle in stuff like flowers or grass tufts onto every screen. The feature can be toggled on or off in the same way as relational and dungeon carver modes are.

A very similar discussion took place on March 5th regarding this.  It's a great concept, really.  I'm glad it's so popular.

"Random Combo type Combo - For placing doodads.."

It won't be a combo of course; it'll be an Alias, at least.

Oh neat. Hopefully it'll be implemented at some point.
