I read through all included libraries and found nothing. Hoping these 2.53.x functions for reading combo data from FFCs are useful.
```
//These are functions for reading various properties of combos used by FFCs.

//Returns Type of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboType(ffc f){
    int origcmb = Screen->ComboD[0];
    Screen->ComboD[0] = f->Data;
    int type = Screen->ComboT[0];
    Screen->ComboD[0] = origcmb;
    return type;
}

//Returns Inherent Flag of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboIFlag(ffc f){
    int origcmb = Screen->ComboD[0];
    Screen->ComboD[0] = f->Data;
    int flag = Screen->ComboI[0];
    Screen->ComboD[0] = origcmb;
    return flag;
}

//Returns Solidity Mask of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboSolidity(ffc f){
    int origcmb = Screen->ComboD[0];
    Screen->ComboD[0] = f->Data;
    int solid = Screen->ComboS[0];
    Screen->ComboD[0] = origcmb;
    return solid;
}```

unfortunately not for 2.55
changing combos like that could break combo scripts running
and, you can use `combodata` to do this much easier

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 09:43

```cpp
combodata cd = Game->LoadComboData(ffc->Data);
Trace(cd->Type);
Trace(cd->OriginalTile);
Trace(cd->Tile);
Trace(cd->Walk);
Trace(cd->Frames);
Trace(cd->Attributes[0]);```etc etc

Here is a 2.55 compliant form
```c
//These are functions for reading various properties of combos used by FFCs.

//Returns Type of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboType(ffc f)
{
    cobodata cd = Game->LoadComboData(f->Data);
    return cd->Type;
}

//Returns Inherent Flag of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboIFlag(ffc f)
{
    cobodata cd = Game->LoadComboData(f->Data);
    return cd->Flag;
}

//Returns Solidity Mask of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboSolidity(ffc f)
{
    cobodata cd = Game->LoadComboData(f->Data);
    return cd->Walk;
}```

I do not tin tat this belongs in `<std>`m but perhaps t might in `<ffcscript>`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 11:14

It doesn't need to exist though as it is literaly one line each

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 11:15

...
```c
//These are functions for reading various properties of combos used by FFCs.

//Returns Type of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboType(ffc f)
{
    return Game->LoadComboData(f->Data)->Type;
}

//Returns Inherent Flag of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboIFlag(ffc f)
{
    return Game->LoadComboData(f->Data)->Flag;
}

//Returns Solidity Mask of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboSolidity(ffc f)
{
    return Game->LoadComboData(f->Data)->Walk;
}    ```
This should work and provide the same result so why make a function when yo can simply do
```int type = Game->LoadComboData(f->Data)->Type;```

My tuppence worth

The 2.53.x version would be...bleah. You'd need a *scratch screen*
to be safe at all
w/o possible bugs

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 11:30

Closest way to do it safely in 2.53.x is this IMO:
```c
//These are functions for reading various properties of combos used by FFCs.

//Returns Type of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboType(ffc f, int scratchmap, int scratchscr)
{
    Game->SetComboData(scratchmap, scratchscr, 0, f->Data);
    return Game->GetComboFlag(scratchmap, scratchscr, 0);
}

//Returns Inherent Flag of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboIFlag(ffc f, int scratchmap, int scratchscr)
{
    Game->SetComboData(scratchmap, scratchscr, 0, f->Data);
    return Game->GetComboType(scratchmap, scratchscr, 0);
}

//Returns Solidity Mask of combo used by given FFC.
int GetFFCComboSolidity(ffc f, int scratchmap, int scratchscr)
{
    Game->SetComboData(scratchmap, scratchscr, 0, f->Data);
    return Game->GetComboSolid(scratchmap, scratchscr, 0);
}
```
