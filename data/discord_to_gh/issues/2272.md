Should be latest nightly build. Clicking through the enemy, item, player, or weapon tabs causes ZQ to instantly quit. Going into the second/third subpages for some of the tabs does the same, although I didn't check which all did that since it seems a bit random. I can check which subtabs also do it if need-be.

Just checked with the nightly from today, seems fixed.
