```Flipper Dive Length of 0 = Infinite or Infinite Diving Flag```
Now that manual dive cancelling is a thing for flippers, this would be a handy upgrade to have. Probably needs to remind you to enable that flag in the tooltip...

(meta) thread name was changed: Flipper Expansion
Also, itemdata sounds for moving in water and diving
I can't remember if any official Zelda had a diving sound but it seems logical to make a sound, doesn't it?
