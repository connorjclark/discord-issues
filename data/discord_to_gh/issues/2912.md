A Check-box added to Hammer Items that allow them to grant the "Continuous" ability to a combo.

Useful for those hammerable pegs that cycle into a _slightly lower peg_ that need to be hammered repeatedly to lower them fully.

What it's _actually_ useful for are those hammer combos that the quest designer has designated "You can't hammer me fast enough before it combo-cycles into the original hammer post, so you need to upgrade your hammer" sorts of affairs.

Well, that, and for when you just don't want to sit there hammering at a peg multiple times, and just want to move on with your life by only hammering it once.

wouldn't it be better to just have a combo that requires a better hammer?

there also is the option of requiring the quake hammer

Combos that are triggered by the Hammer Quake effect is a novel idea and one worth looking into, perhaps, sure.

Otherwise, the "Trigger Continuous" flag for a hammer is more of a convenience thing,
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "wouldn't it be better to just…"): ... but at the same time, if it were a combo that required a hammer of a certain level to even be triggered at all, then we wouldn't get a scriptless experience of "I can see the hammer affecting it, but I can't do it fast enough.  I need a stronger hammer to hammer it in the first time."

I just realized you can make combos change when you own a certain item
