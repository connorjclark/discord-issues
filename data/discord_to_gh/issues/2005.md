Bug is present in the newest nightly. Was not present in 107. Cannot speak to intervening builds. Essentially, picking up a bestiary entry item causes ZC to seem to pause and hang for a second or so. To easily replicate this, with the WIP randomizer build sent to the devs, use the file name SHIRT to get to the randomizer menu, and input the seed 8CA75A, then set "Bestiary In Pool" to true. Start, and warp to dmap 0, screen 07. Pick up the book on that screen and you'll see a noticeable pause or stutter. This stutter did not occur in 107 and does not seem to occur with picking up other items.

I don't have said WIP build afaik

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 17:33

I'll send it to you

This (Bestiary Lag), the Character Switching, and Stellar Weapons lagging can all be traced back to the "Destructors call on any object destruction" commit
It appears that mass deletion of objects causes significant lag
Stellar Weapons are obvious as presumably they're just creating 1 frame hitboxes

I know exactly what's causing this
Need to fix it the same way I did for generic scripts

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2022 15:34

the other two might not sound obvious, but bestiaries due to an oversight are an equipment non-gameplay item of a higher level that doesn't keep lower items, causing it to remove 30-ish items from your inventory, and character switching changes your currently owned items
Both of these are important, as changing Link's owned items causes the entire subscreen to be rebuilt, *including* deleting all of the sprites on the subscreen (which presumably would call the destructors)
(I know you already know this Emily, but it's fun to explain what causes bugs)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2022 15:46

furthermore, every time it checks for destructors to call
it's iterating over the max object count
....which is 214748
The fix is to iterate to the max object that has been used, instead of the max that CAN be used

=== @ Russ 11/06/2022 15:46

So this is like... 3 massively unoptimized loops nested?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2022 15:47

Oh yeah, because it doesn't even check if you *own* the item before trying to take it away

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2022 15:49

and it flushes the subscreen each time it removes an item, instead of just doing it once *after* the loop

@ Russ
see if this fixes these 3 lag issues

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2022 16:54
