Real dark rooms. I added this, but it has more to go.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2021 09:34

-more shapes for the lantern item to give link's light (i.e. LTTP cone)
-~~any weapon/enemy/item (any `sprite`) able to glow, with whatever radius~~ done
~~-init data set default range for sprites~~ done
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) anything you want to add here feel free

=== @ P-Tux7 09/07/2021 14:55

does torch cycling to non-torches still have the caveat of they all need to be different combo IDs so they don't sync?

=== @ vlamart 09/07/2021 16:17

Will this also have an option for dim (transparent black) and dark (opaque black), as well as an option for the lantern to control that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 00:28

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "does torch cycling to non-tor‚Ä¶"): cycling is cycling nothing is special about this
(replying to @ vlamart "Will this also have an option‚Ä¶"): to make a room be transparently dark would be a new screen flag.... should be easy enough
to make the edge of the light area be transparently dark... is more troublesome, so that'll be a while.
but, while *transparency* is a lot of extra work
*dithering* seems surprisingly easy

a test for dithering effects, here hard-coded to take up 1/5 of link's lantern radius. (will add configurables at some point, but for now, proof of concept)

=== @ vlamart 09/08/2021 00:59

That's gorgeous üëèüòç

=== @ P-Tux7 09/08/2021 00:59

doesn't the lens have dithering? or is it just multiple circles alternating
though this is extremely cool looking yeah

applied to all light circles, and added another type of dithering effect
(will likely have a dropdown selection of any number of different dithering effects to choose from, as a quest-wide setting)

showcase of 18 different dither effects (type 0-17, number displayed upper-left corner)
if anyone has any ideas for more, feel free; it can fit up to 256 types without almost any difficulty whatsoever
just needs to be a mathematically describable pattern

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 06:10

(i.e. type 0 is `(x+y)%2`, type 6 is `((x%4)==(y%4)`)
(if the formula gives a nonzero value, that pixel is *clear*; zero values are blacked out)

=== @ KoolAid 09/08/2021 06:46

yesssssss

=== @ KoolAid 09/08/2021 06:56

Could you even do like `sin(x¬≤ + y¬≤) == cos(x*y)`
I mean squaring isnt like that but yk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 06:59

Don't see why not
I'll try that when I get back upstairs to see what that makes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 08:20

OK, so, doing an exact equality fails to do much good
because, it's all very many decimal places
but, filtering based on difference produced some interesting things

wowie

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 10:07

So ummm
I did a big thing
Now instead of just having a `type` of dither
it also has an `arg` value
so like

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/884733133470187540/885104363847180359/unknown.png?ex=65e840ac&is=65d5cbac&hm=a292ef93c57977445e7b0a2139c4df39387dc9edfb8c3ab9c7598a6a637934f8&)

those 2 were both shown in the video.... now they are one type, with different args
and

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/884733133470187540/885104458827190282/unknown.png?ex=65e840c3&is=65d5cbc3&hm=039cbdde790f3558b4bb611b22395a85dba1a237dcfa97749076f433c0ab8db2&)
that means you can scale it more

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/08/2021 10:09

Ooh, thank you.  I guess it's not possible that the dithering types can cycle or animate though, right?  Or anything can be transparent?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 10:09

transparency is planned, more difficult to add
it'll either be:
1. Whole screen is transparent black, aside from lit areas
2. Area near edge of light is transparent (similar to area near edge of light is dithered; can combine with dither or choose one/the other)
(meaning you can choose either 1 or 2, not I'm only adding one of those)
but now for real fancyness

a set of static noise maps
arg value `0` for them is total black (nothing passes the check)
arg value `255` is total clear (every pixel passes)
and everything inbetween is an even sliding scale
higher the number, the more is visible; but it appears in static patterns, as generated by the function `sin(x^2 + y^2) == cos(x*y)`
...except it isn't `==`
it's adapted to be sliding scale
so, really, `abs(sin(x^2 + y^2) - cos(x*y)) < ((arg/255.0)*2000)/1000.0`
i.e. `the difference between "sin(x^2+y^2)" and "cos(x*y)" is less than a value determined by the arg`
.....knowing the math isn't important to using it though, just, higher number = more visible

This *IS* scripted
but, all it's doing
is `itemsprite->LightRadius = val`
and `lweapon->LightRadius = val`
also available for `npc` and `eweapon`, of course

fire weapon types start with the radius set in init data
everything else starts with 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/09/2021 16:30

OK, so making a change
Instead of the dither percentage being how much *inward* of the radius is dithered
it's how much *outward* is dithered
because otherwise, stacking dither + trans on radius won't work very well

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/884733133470187540/885562961379348550/unknown.png?ex=65e9ebc6&is=65d776c6&hm=57d3249ca20a73e255a370cdb8d63c50f45af3a9d788a282eff3fcf1443f3ec3&)
Here's an example with `25% dither`, `50% trans`
so the dither goes out 1/4 the radius farther than the light circle
and transparency goes out 1/2 the radius farther than the light circle
(dither/trans are handled *entirely separately*, but stack fine)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/09/2021 16:40

And I take it if you do 50% dither 25% trans, it'll do trans dither, then solid dither, then solid?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/09/2021 16:40

should, aye
having a fun time with scrolling not working at the moment....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/09/2021 16:48

ah duh, ok fixed

there that is
50% dither, 25% trans

ooooooooh

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/09/2021 17:08

That's pretty darn neat.  Congrats!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/09/2021 17:09

Basically how it works

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/09/2021 17:09

I wonder if it would be feasible to have a flag for the Lens of Truth that lets it see through the darkness.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/09/2021 17:09

is, there are 2 bitmaps per 'screen' now (so 4 total to include scrolling)
(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "I wonder if it would be feasi‚Ä¶"): probably easy to add
anyway
basically
there's a 'normal' bitmap, and a 'trans' bitmap for each screen
both of them get all the same draws
except, if a transparency radius is enabled
it clears that entire radius in the 'normal' bitmap
so, for any pixels in that radius, they will be clear on the 'normal', and whatever they were before on the 'trans'
the trans bitmap is blitted transparently to the screen, so by leaving those pixels on only that one, they display... transparently.

best way to handle this will probably be 9 `line` draws, followed by a fillbucket in the center

=== @ P-Tux7 09/09/2021 17:56

i'm pretty sure the big one has more lines than that
@ Moosh ripped the graphic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/09/2021 17:58

it might, but the way this needs to work is by having a single shape draw, and then just doing a larger one
so both will need to be the same shape for this implementation
won't match lttp perfectly

(assuming the top tip is Link's center, and given a `66` range, with `20%` dither or trans radius; the lime is the dither/trans area)
....now the fun thing is, this is directional, and the math is entirely different per-direction
so, I only have `down` done
`up` should just require flipping every y-sign
but then left/right will be a bitch

WOO
now, uh, diagonal dirs are a thing that uh, would be a problem
so if I make shapes available to more than just Link, I'll need to handle that.... which will require either creating entirely new math!
for just link, this should work though

bigger (66 range, same as LTTP)

(except lttp wouldn't have 50% transparency range, so it would probably end at the edge of the dithering instead)

the transparency on the radial thing
and the transparency on the screen level
seem to stack

=== @ vlamart 09/09/2021 20:40

Extra dope!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/09/2021 20:40

what that means is the outer area is actually 2x dark
effectively, 2 transparent draws of black stacked
while the inner is only 1
a completely accidental side-effect of implementing the radial transparency
...technically a bug, but uh, it's a feature!

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 06:09

Why does the light cone appear to grow larger at diagonals? I imagine there'd be some rounding on the rotation but not quite that much

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 11:05

might need some adjusting

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 12:11

Okay, so question: if this is just a series of points, that means theoretically this could be rotated near-seamlessly with 360 degree rotation, yeah?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 12:11

if you want to use rotated draw functions, aye
I've avoided using those for any of this, to make the draws faster

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 12:14

so here's a jank-ass idea: torches that use this specific cone draw, only on the opposite side of the torch from link and rotated to be facing in that same direction

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 12:15

. . . . ????

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 12:16

basically a torch that "looks" away from Link
...actually that sounds kinda nonsensical
disregard that

believe that's better

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 12:25

(looks a LOT better, despite that that was a 1-pixel shrink)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 12:30

The dithering area on diagonals feels larger than it should be (unless you haven't ported the change over to it yet)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 12:30

it's not
this should be effectively a pure rotation
it likely *looks* larger because of that dithering pattern being more visible on the diagonals
but, I literally modified the base drawing function, so it affects all instances
the diagonals are also a 17-point polygon instead of an 11-point polygon
might be rounding affecting it too, since it involves floating point math

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 12:32

I'm looking at the amount of space the non-dithered transparent part the diagonals have, and it's a lot smaller than the cardinals even taking into account the rotation

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 12:34

the outline of both the completely cut out portion and the outline of the transparent one seem correct

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 12:34

they all use literally the same function call
so
can't have 2 be correct and 1 not

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 12:35

could you try the checkerboard dither?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 12:36

the only explanation I have is rounding differences
there are multiple pieces of floating-point math at work
feel free to play with it if you want, I likely won't be working on this for at least until Monday; `2.55-dither` branch still

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 12:37

alright
also transparent + checkerboard dither looks really good

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 12:38

aye, I love all of this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 12:38

...okay so random question
Would it be possible to dither solid black on top of the transparent parts?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 12:39

blehg
not at all easily

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 12:40

fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 12:40

and to have that be *togglable* would be far worse

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 19:55

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Moosh"): Yup, looks great. Funny what one pixel of difference can make

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 19:56

Despite being a very simple feature on the gameplay end, this light cone is really neat. I'm glad it's engine now. Also obsoleting my scripts not even a new version later xD

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 20:56

XD
(replying to @ Moosh "Despite being a very simple f‚Ä¶"): Any more scripts of yours I should work on obsoleting?

oh I wish that were remotely feasible
that's something to wait for the rewrite

I do fry my brain just staring at the script haha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 21:10

I totally understand Moosh's script
hell, I tore it apart for MM2D to have 19 different items placable in bottles
and hooked it directly into my database shop script

=== @ vlamart 09/10/2021 21:12

That's Doprah Winfrey and beautiful

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:18

All that could be left here is more shapes if people can think of some; keep in mind torches can't use shapes as it's currently set up, so adding more for torches would be extra work (but theoretically doable)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/26/2022 04:52

Bumping this open again; do still need to add the ability to do draws to the darkroom bitmap.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/28/2022 03:26

Should we do the same for the light puzzles thread and that bitmap, too?
