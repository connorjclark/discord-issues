This isn't in #2130 because it's one of those things most questmakers would want to be on/off for every Manhandla in the quest.

With this QR on...
-Hitting a Manhandla core doesn't count as hitting/killing an enemy for script purposes
-Hitting a Manhandla core plays the "tink" sound like when hitting a shielded enemy instead of the "harm" sound like the heads do when hurt.
