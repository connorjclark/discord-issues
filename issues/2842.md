Would it be possible to put in such an option to make the animation always start on the first frame like for example, a line of step>next after link walks down creates a "chasing" effect like in twinkling christmas lights instead of all synchronized by a global animation cycle.  I tried both checkbox "refresh animation on room entry and when cycled to" and its still all synced.

(replying to @ cbailey78 "Would it be possible to put i…"): With step->next, no
but
if you use a `Step->` + `Combo Change: 1` combo trigger
which is basically the same thing
you can also add the trigger flag `Reset Anim`

Thanks, I'll try that.

Ok, I tried what you suggested, but when I walk down the line of combos, all the combo animation/cycling reset rather than resetting only the combo being stepped on.

(replying to @ cbailey78 "Ok, I tried what you suggeste…"): If they are the same combo ID, they will all reset
combo animations are per ID
it is not POSSIBLE to reset only one
so... uh... yeah
.....though, uh, reading it again
why don't you just use Crumbling Floor combos for this?
sounds like *exactly* what they are for

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2023 23:23

(you would create several NON-animated crumbling floor combos, set their crumble time to how long you want it to stay on that animation frame, use the `Inevitable` type so it keeps crumbling starting the moment you first step on it, checking `Continuous` so it keeps crumbling through all the combos in the sequence)
