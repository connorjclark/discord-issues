A push block that moves until solid, or `no push block`. Would also be neat if could damage enemies while moving (though would need to account for if things freeze on screen or not while the block is moving)

Just going to have this be part of #2293. Still would like a sort of "icy floor" to go with, though...

Icy Floor added, only able to be slippery to blocks currently.

Icy floor like pokemon no traction, or rubberband-like slipperiness?

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Icy Floor added, only able to…"): as I mentioned, for now, only pushblocks
