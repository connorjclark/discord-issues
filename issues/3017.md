I did a search for "shift-i" in this channel and it didn't come up with anything so here goes.

Instead of doing an "i" in the combo pages to insert a single new combo, shift-i would ask you how many to insert (or delete) with a text combo.

And as a reminder, it would also be able to be undone with ctrl-z or whatever, because humans are monkeys and operate through experimentation and don't yet realize that fire is too hot to eat.

Yeah I feel like there's plenty of simple ways to increase automation in ZC, and this is one of them. Hopefully the undo isn't a nightmare but if it is, saving quest before major changes and reverting is always there I guess!

Yep.  

May as well add a reminder to the box that pops up to keep in mind that combos changed by scripts will have to be changed manually, because I don't think ZQuest can search through script files to alter text like that.

also, kind of weird that inserting a tile puts it *before* the tile you selected, not after

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 01/28/2024 00:24

I think it's nicer before, honestly.  Seems to feel natural.  Never had any adverse thoughts about that particular thing.
I didn't even know we could highlight an entire combo page and press i.
That's just one page, though, but I guess it adds up.
Imagine a button on the combo page that does that so it's not just an obscure hidden hotkey.

I love this idea. Please please please
Or even 4 at a time so it's a full row?

Not denying this suggestion but you can insert multiple combos at once by selecting multiple combos (hold shift and click) and press i with multiple selected; it will insert that many combos
might be neat to do a different method though

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Not denying this suggestion b…"): aye, this was suggested like immediately after I explained this is a thing, so already had that in mind

So the final remaining question is, how visible is this feature to users?  I'm sure no one wants to be asked many many times for the same thing over the course of years.
