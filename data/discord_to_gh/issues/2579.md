Instead of just being a checkbox, can the Push-> combo trigger flag be made into a timer, so that you can specify how long to push it?

\* The `Push->` combo trigger flag, since it wasn't specified

I feel unsure, since at any length of pushing past the default Z1 pushing length it can be mistaken that the combo is unpushable.

anything on if this is doable?

Or what if you want a joke secret that requires pushing a wall for an absurdly long time lol
all valid reasons to add this

Curious if it'd be possible to also vary the speed at which the block moves from one tile to the next. I'd imagine this would be a lot easier now that solid FFCs function correctly for the most part

(replying to @ Phosphor "Curious if it'd be possible t…"): for actual pushblocks moving? Use the `Push (Generic)` type and you might find what you seek...
