```        float rings[3] = {-0.75, -0.33, 0};
        Trace(rings[0]);
        Trace(rings[1]);
        Trace(rings[2]);```
Traces
```
0.7500
0.3300
0.0000```
Doing the same with integer values does appear to have this issue
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) uhhhhh???

parser issue for sure, the zasm has it positive...

probably something to do with `-0`

and, normal vars work fine
it's ONLY arrays, so probably something in `WRITEPODARRAY` calculation specifically

bleh, can't find it without debugger, time to build debug...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 04:34

haha

compiling the script in debug does not happy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 04:45

ah, looks like I missed some parts of the optimizing away unused variables (namely, unused arrays...)
...which wouldn't cause the negative issue, so likely separate. Yay.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 04:48

ahk, that part's fixed, now my test script (which had no tracing, just declared the array) doesn't produce any array. (as intended)

....oookay....

it generates the vector properly

GAAAH ITS IN CONVERTING TO A STRING
OF COURSE IT IS
<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> this is why I added `zfix::str()` to convert to string simply, so I can use that in everywhere now. Lets double-check that THAT doesn't have the same problem...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 04:57

hahaha it did
of course it did
