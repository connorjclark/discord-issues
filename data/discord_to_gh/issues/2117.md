Quest: A Link to the Zelda
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&id=376
Screen to test: DMap 0- Overworld, Screen: 30, Entrance: A
This screen is marked as "This Screen is Sideview" in an otherwise-top-down DMap. Link falls normally when facing up or down, but when he faces left or right, he does not fall.
Check out this bug in action in my replay. (Nightly 12-23, though I assume the code has not changed because testing it in 12-31 gives the same result)

Went back as far as Jun (first time mac was supported) and bug was still present.
Can you try some older builds?
Also, it's possible that this is intentionally done via scripting.
It is a troll quest after all 😛

it certainly didn't happen in 2.50.2, and I believe there are no scripts at all (I did worm my way into the quest file to get the screen data, after all)
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Can you try some older builds?"): Will do

The pzc description suggests there's scripting.
perhaps it's a meta-troll.

lolol
always read the small print

Yeah this is Mr. Z's only 2.5x quest, all his others were in pre-scripting versions

note to self: do alpha testing tomorrow
