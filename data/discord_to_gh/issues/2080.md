Happens consistently in the fairy pond in the west woods in 7th quest rando when the starting accelerator flag is checked. Link becomes unable to move as the first heart of the healing ring is drawing. Can F6 out but the healing ring does not finish drawing.

Tested on the newest nightly.

dmap, screen?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/12/2022 05:44

does the test build here fix it? https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1048494782617505812

(wondering it this is an input issue)

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2022 05:46

Will take a look. I just got done with a run of 7th. It was on DMap 0, screen 8:0x74
Where's best to post failed replays btw? The 7th run had an rng desync pretty early in

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/12/2022 05:47

A thread in the replays channel.

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2022 05:49

Actually hmm...after I try to replay it it desyncs frame 0? Did I screw something up there?

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2022 05:50

okay reloading ZC entirely fixed that

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2022 06:01

Didn't seem to work

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/12/2022 06:01

Ok, unrelated then

=== @ Moosh 12/12/2022 06:02

Here's a replay that just starts a run and triggers the bug. On the 2.53 version of the quest

@ Moosh this was a bug in replay, "Assert" mode should work though. Next nightly will fix "replay" mode too.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/18/2022 02:45

> when the starting accelerator flag is checked

What does this mean?
Haven't been able to reproduce.

=== @ Moosh 12/18/2022 08:55

Ah sorry about that. Didn't think to elaborate further because I had the working replay of the bug. Accelerator is a late game item in the quest that lets you move faster by double tapping in a direction. One of the randomizer settings (accessed by pressing up down down up down down down down and then entering the code RNGMAX) lets you start with a weaker version of the accelerator to make runs go faster

=== @ Moosh 12/18/2022 08:57

The thing accelerator is doing that triggers the bug I think is that it can continue to move Link while engine things are killing his inputs. So the bug appears to happen when he steps onto a fairy tile and then the accelerator pushes him off of it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 06:15

hey @ Moosh , you think you could make a new zplay for this?

😅

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2023 03:10

Link is stuck in the `freeze` action/state

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2023 03:11

I think this only happens during recording/replay?

=== @ Moosh 01/30/2023 03:12

Not in my experience. Have you been unable to reproduce it outside of the replay?
If it's just LA_FREEZE I wonder if I could un-hang it with a script...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2023 03:18

Wait, it _may_ be specific to if you are not grid aligned ..

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2023 03:22

the top of `HeroClass::checkspecial2` early returns in that case..and only in that function does fairycircle code run ... which will eventually unfreeze link
does your script happen to set the x,y position of link manually?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2023 03:25

You could also disable `qr_OLDSTYLEWARP` maybe to fix.

=== @ Moosh 01/30/2023 03:34

Huh. I am no longer able to reproduce it with that rule off.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2023 03:47

confirmed a global script is moving link slightly the frame after the fairy circle starts

=== @ Moosh 01/30/2023 03:51

Yeah that sounds about right.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2023 03:52

confirming a fix for qr_OLDSTYLEWARP in CI, will merge if it nothing breaks
