Thread from PureZC:
https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=76556
Details:
Zelda.exe does not display the correct animations for "Slash", "Stab" and "Pound" when the Animation Style is set to "Zelda 3". Instead, Zelda.exe defaults to the standard behavior of "Original" and "BS-Zelda" animation styles.
While editing and previewing Link's sprites in ZQuest, these animations are displayed correctly. "Slash" is expanded to 6 unique frames of animation, "Stab" is expanded to 3 unique frames of animation, and "Pound" is expanded to 3 unique frames of animation. This represents the original intention of the developer who first implemented Zelda 3 animation for Link, but it was never fully implemented in Zelda.exe itself.

=== @ Zaidyer 12/19/2021 16:26

Additionally, "Charge" does not reset to the first frame when the player stops moving. Instead, it defaults to the way it works in "Original" and "BS Zelda" styles, where it will stop on the current frame and stay that way until the player does something.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/19/2021 17:36

Don't forget swimming, which only uses two frames for each of "floating" and swimming

=== @ jman2050 01/04/2022 07:53

hmm?

=== @ jman2050 01/04/2022 07:54

yeah, none of that did get finished, did it...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 10:26

@ Zaidyer could you show me a setup of the correctly set up tiles for these animations?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 10:27

I'm curious if the sword's tile and positioning should also be changed to account for this animation style

This is what it was supposed to be when the feature was first added, though I see swimming has changed since then

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 10:30

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "I'm curious if the sword's ti‚Ä¶"): It *just barely* works as-is but the alignment is a little weird and it's particularly bad when facing up. It looks even worse when using a taller sprite, which is not unheard-of now thanks to the incredible wealth of sprites from the Randomizer alone

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 10:36

Slash facing up at full extension barely clears this sprite's head

Charging up a Spin Attack while facing up doesn't clear this sprite *at all*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 10:37

The problem here is mostly the fact that the sword is only one tile long
which doesn't work well with that graphical style
it being behind the head there is the exact proper *hitbox* alignment for it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 10:38

I mean, we could have the sword extend outwards more with positioning, though there might be some disjointed hitboxes involved

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 10:38

It'd be more awkward for collision to make it look better graphically
the proper solution would be a longer sword
but uh
fuck no
the way that size shit works is so terrible and I hate it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 10:39

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the proper solution would be‚Ä¶"): don't tempt me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 10:40

Be tempted, bitch

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 10:40

ugh, Z3 sword already sounds nightmarish enough

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 10:40

I tried adjusting this with the Weapon hitbox and draw offsets in the item editor. But it interacts strangely with the sword

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 10:40

you just tempted me to make a whole new launcher, deedee
you get this in return

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 10:40

I diiiiiiid üò©

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 10:40

(replying to @ Zaidyer "I tried adjusting this with t‚Ä¶"): yes the sword sucks
everything about the sword is bad

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 10:40

Look, you people dug your own grave here when you made the Bug Catching Net a 180-degree slash instead of a spin attack
make a sword that does that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 10:41

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) you could probably copy most of that
that won't help making it longer, though
a `sword length` attribute would be the way to handle longer
and all the hardcoded bullshit would need to adjust based on that

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 10:44

I have a radical suggestion for the Sword issue and I think I'll have to make another thread for it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 10:46

Okay, so from the sprites you sent
slashing needs to be 4 frames if it's the standard LA slash
And 6 frames if I were to implement 180 sword slashing

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 10:47

indeedly-doo

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 10:47

You wouldn't happen to have sword sprites for the directions for these, would you?
I need to know how to position the sword for up facing big sprites

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 10:48

I can generate them real quick, gimme a minute

Worth noting that when the sword is fully-extended (frame 6 here) the animation speed *changes* for that particular frame
Normally the animation speed is 1 (or 17 milliseconds), for frame 6 here it's 4 (or 67 milliseconds)

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/922161694782943322/932953415942807573/link_attack_zoom-x1_speed-100l.gif?ex=65e6fc13&is=65d48713&hm=c17e6af6bcd13528c92a75ef37262455ce8ea50abb6bfbc5c7fe1f744fca52ae&)

And for good measure, left facing. This is mirrored for right facing, obvs

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 11:11

Okay so it looks like the sword is 16x16 from a glance
but the hitbox would extend further down when up facing, so as to catch enemies inside of link

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 11:13

also that adds up to 12 frames of sword slashing; but the ZQ preview seems to be *24* frames of slashing

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 11:21

Possibly due to conjecture
It was really hard to measure this stuff 15 years ago

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 11:25

The sword is indeed 16x16 except for when it‚Äôs 16x8 or 8x16. Not counting the Master Sword which *looks* bigger but may in fact not have a bigger hitbox

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 11:26

In A Link to the Past, the sprites for the Master Sword are drawn for the same tile size as the Fighter Sword, and while slashing the game adds an extra specially drawn 8x8 tile to the tip to make it longer.
Except when it doesn‚Äôt do that
It won‚Äôt lengthen the Master Sword if you slash while walking down a slow walk combo on the overworld
It doesn‚Äôt lengthen it *ever* in the GBA port

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 11:33

Ergo I think ‚Äúlonger sword‚Äù features would probably work differently in ZC if they‚Äôre attempted at all

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 12:45

uhhhhhh
okay I'm very weirded out
There appears to be bitmap shenanigans going on

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 12:51

What am I seeing here

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 12:52

I recall triggering a bizarre ‚Äúevery tile is shifted weirdly in a box around Big Link‚Äù bug but I forget how, might be a quest rule

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 12:53

(replying to @ Zaidyer "I recall triggering a bizarre‚Ä¶"): that's exactly what is happening

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 12:54

Turn off all the rules and see if that fixes it
Might be one of the newer ones actually

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 12:59

Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing needs to be enabled for it to draw correctly
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) also the pick ruleset dialogue doesn't activate any QRs or anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 13:02

?
(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Old (Faster) Sprite Drawing n‚Ä¶"): check `sprite::draw()` for bitmap shenanigans

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 13:03

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "?"): When you Pick a Ruleset... it does nothing
whether you press OK, Cancel, etc

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 13:07

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ```cpp
void call_ruleset_dlg()
{
    PickRulesetDialog([](int32_t ruleset)
    {
        applyRuleset(ruleset);
    }).show();
}```
try changing this to ```cpp
PickRulesetDialog(applyRuleset).show();```?
if not, then try debugger to see wtf is going wrong

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 13:15

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I'm not very familiar with the new sprite drawing
VC?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/18/2022 13:23

not rn, maybe in an hour or two if you're still on?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 19:19

Okay, so the sword needs to be repositioned with big Link in all directions
except maybe down? Idk
But left, right, and up aren't cutting it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2022 19:32

Either way, the Link sprites themselves are working
though it looks terrible without working on the weapons as well; the best looking one is the sword slash, which looks kinda decent
But stabbing and hammer both draw *under* Link and can barely be seen

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:01

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Okay, so the sword needs to b‚Ä¶"): this should preferably be a customizable stored offset given that there's at least two big link sprites (LTTP, Minish Cap)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:04

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ""): wait, is this a shadow being drawn under Link, or is it part of the sprite

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:08

if it's part of the sprite it looks very weird when used with roc's feather and falling down from a warp pit, and lttp uses it for a lot of other shenanigans as well (while he's invisible when hurt, while he's invisible when using the magic cape, gb cliffs, pegasus boots bonking)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:10

(other uses for constant drawn shadows include having an item on the floor or while falling from the ceiling have a shadow on the ground but not while held up, and telling the Z-Axis [if enabled] of jumping/flying enemies + all enemies that fall from ceilings not looking weird)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:11

you know, i don't know if we could fit it (maybe as an item flag or quest rule?), but invisible enemies that only display their shadows until you get the amulet would be hilarious

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 22:11

Shadows are one thing, but the bigger issue here are the hard-coded weapon offsets

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:12

(replying to @ Zaidyer "The sword is indeed 16x16 exc‚Ä¶"): IIRC, it does.

=== @ Zaidyer 01/18/2022 22:12

Might have to make those adjustable to account for variance in sprites

=== @ P-Tux7 01/18/2022 22:13

The other issue is that even if you COULD adjust the offsets from the item editor tab... what about the *beam*?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 14:08

the new animations are kinda in in the nightly; they look bad without me doing the weapon portion, but the sprite portion should work

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 19:43

oh?
also hold on a sec

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 19:55

Ok so hi I am making a Big Link sprite
and is it positioned like this

(Magenta/purple: Tile delineators
Cyan: Tile that I should pick in the player sprite picker? Maybe?
Blue: Link's hitbox if set to Big Player Hitbox)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 20:11

The top one
But
cyan should be where the blue is

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 20:15

ohh ok
i thought it was upper left since it was like that for enemies
wait so do big link sprites use all 6 tiles, or just the 32x32 pixel portion in the center of that image?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 20:20

just the 32x32 portion

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:27

thanks!
i'd appreciate if you could post a guide to the new animations, what they're used for, how many frames, etc.

i thought swimming was four frames

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 22:43

swimming is 4 frames, yeah
that image isn't completely accurate

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:44

ah good you set it to that?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 22:44

But it's like, a lot of frames of walking
4 frames of slashing (6 when 180 sword gets added)
3 frames of stabbing and hammering

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:45

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "But it's like, a lot of frame‚Ä¶"): 1 standing 8 walking

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:50

so is the "wands and canes use pound" rule thing still unimplemented?
(i imagine for sake of implementation the rule being on would ignore both whether the wand/cane can melee damage and whether it uses slash or not)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:52

lemme pin something

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:54

link's framedata when using rods in lttp:
1st tile: 3 frames
2nd tile: 4 frames
3rd tile: 6 frames
appears to be same numbers for all directions
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 22:54

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "so is the "wands and canes us‚Ä¶"): yeah, still is
Right now, my focus currently is searching for compat issues
fixing them

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:54

and let's see hammer framedata...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 22:55

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "link's framedata when using r‚Ä¶"): thank you
will be very helpful later

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:55

link's framedata when using the hammer in lttp:
1st tile: 3 frames
2nd tile: 4 frames
3rd tile: 17 frames
appears to be same numbers for all directions

oh, you know what? even though it's inaccurate to LTTP, that means the hammer sparks should start on frame 8 as well since that's when the hammer touches the ground
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
the wand/hammer frames are synced up to each link frame, no desync or anything. they also make link unable to move until the animation is complete. so he's paused for 13 frames using a rod, and 24 frames using the hammer
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:58

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Right now, my focus currently‚Ä¶"): oh god you mean old quests?
sorry that i haven't been very helpful on that lately
been in a slump

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 23:00

Well; sorta
right now I've been in a Yuurand mood and have been trying to get Yuurand working in 2.55
but certain. goddamn. music tracks keep looping the first few seconds but they don't in 2.53

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/20/2022 23:01

Great test case for tons of bugs
I haven't the first idea about anything music-related

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 23:02

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Great test case for tons of b‚Ä¶"): Panoply should be too for npc scripts since it directly modifies engine enemies far more than most other quests do, though in a global or ffc script of course
and her 6th quest too
and i think lweapons and eweapons too...?
the enemy stuff in that quest is an "according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that..." moment

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/21/2022 01:05

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "but certain. goddamn. music t‚Ä¶"): and it turns out this might have been my stupid fault and I might've gone on a wild goose chase for nothing
lovely.

=== @ Zaidyer 01/25/2022 12:34

Changelog for Alpha 102 reports Z3 Animation fixes but I'm not seeing any
ZQuest still plays the long (correct) animations while ZC falls back to BS-Zelda style

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2022 13:42

Does that include the weird 2-frame swimming/swim moving?
Also, make sure to save your quest in Alpha 102 - I'm sure there's compatibility checks in place so older quests use the old buggy kind

=== @ Zaidyer 01/25/2022 13:48

Okay so I didn't notice there was a new compatibility rule I needed to uncheck
So far it's hard to tell that the new animations are working with the base A Link to the Past sprites, but I did some frame-by-frame checks and they do work now. Albeit strangely for some weapons.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) Hookshot is doing a weird thing where you see frame 1 of Stab while the weapon is being drawn, then at the very end when it's retracted all the way and stops being drawn you see frame 2 of Stab

=== @ Zaidyer 01/25/2022 13:53

The full Slash animation for the Sword is played but cuts out before the end, I presume this is based on earlier discussion here about doing that for 90-degree slashing

=== @ Zaidyer 01/25/2022 13:54

The full 3-frame Hammer animation isn't working though. It switches from Hammer to Stab at the end.

=== @ Zaidyer 01/25/2022 14:06

That's not a case of mistaken sprites on my end either, I used different ones for each animation and it definitely changes from Hammer to Stab

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2022 14:08

I'll also look into the death animation tomorrow

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2022 14:09

Besides Link flopping in Z3, Z3 Link uses two walking frames of animation while rotating in ZC, instead of Z3 where he only used the standing frames

=== @ P-Tux7 01/25/2022 14:38

Also perhaps a Boomerang toss/catch sprite, and a QR that makes the boomerang have a delay to it before spawning, as well as showing in Link's hand during the delay. I'll have to crunch the frames there too

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/25/2022 22:52

(replying to @ Zaidyer "@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) Hooksh‚Ä¶"): ah shoot, I need to have an exception for the hookshot

=== @ P-Tux7 01/26/2022 00:18

Oh turns out there's no catch sprite even if you stand still
Boomerang hold: 7 frames
Boomerang toss (same as stab/hookshot): 6 frames

=== @ P-Tux7 01/26/2022 00:47

Hurt frames
Code:
H: Hurt, visible
I: Invisible except for shadow (which becomes small during this animation)
HHIHIHIHIHIHIHIHIHI
In short, 1 extra hurt frame at the beginning, then 18 more frames where hurt and invisible are alternated
Total: 19

=== @ P-Tux7 01/26/2022 00:56

Death frames:
72 hurt frames in the direction that Link is facing (NO flickering)
6 down-stand frames
6 left-stand frames
6 up-stand frames
6 right-stand frames
6 down-stand frames
6 left-stand frames
6 up-stand frames
6 right-stand frames
6 down-stand frames
6 left-stand frames
6 up-stand frames
6 right-stand frames
4 Death frame 1
("Bonk" displays beneath Link for the first 4 frames of this next animation)
292(?) Death frame 2
Total: 440 (if this is longer than the Z1/ZC death animation, feel free to cut off the Death Frame 2)

Death frame 1 and 2 are always facing to the right, so we only need 1 death player sprite.
I'll try and get the boomerang/death bonk offsets later

=== @ P-Tux7 01/26/2022 00:58

(If you're wondering what the death bonk is, it's this. It's gotta be displayed separately due to being drawn beneath the player tiles)

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "ah shoot, I need to have an e‚Ä¶"): This is the only *bug*, right?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/03/2022 04:25

I think so, yeah
wand too maybe

(meta) thread name was changed: üîìZ3 Animations unimplemented in Zelda.exe

=== @ P-Tux7 02/08/2022 18:19

yeah so, we should move this to feature requests for expansion?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 07:10

oh god... i need to research the *spin attack* framedata
i am very sorry
