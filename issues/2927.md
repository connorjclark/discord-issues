If you turn the Player Collision off via `Player->CollDetection = false`, the player won't take damage from npcs or damage combos. However, *Solid* Damage Combos, or even just pushing against a solid combo with Damage Combos on the layer will still damage the player. Could be a result of Damage Combos on Layers or a New / Newer Hero movement thing.

Issue is present in 2.50.2
so, might need compat handling?
