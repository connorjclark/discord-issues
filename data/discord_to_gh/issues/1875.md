Using the straight-up unzipped nightly from September 17th 2022 and my own Cambria quest file imported from slightly earlier builds.

In this quest file, after I successfully compile my entire script file buffer and after assigning scripts to the various slots, (Even if I don't actually assign any, and just outright hit "OK.")  it crashes to desktop immediately after clicking OK.

I've uploaded a zipped copy of my entire test folder.  All that consists of is:
1)  That nightly from the 17th, freshly unzipped.
2)  My copied-and-pasted quest file.  It has no password.
3)  The "ZeroSixScripts.zh" file that I Also imported into the same folder.  It won't compile without it.

If there's anything else I can upload to help reproduce this bug, let me know.  Though I don't think there is anything; I was able to recreate this bug within just the span of a single minute after creating an all new folder and copying stuff into it.

It's interesting - It compiled successfully without crashing before, even just yesterday.
... I mean technically it still compiles successfully today, though it crashes before letting me back into the world to edit stuff after assigning scripts to FFCs;  Even if I don't actually assign anything to the slots and just hit OK right away instead.

Ah, sorry, I have no idea what's the same crash as those crashes and what's not.
