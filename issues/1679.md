Bit of a weird request, but it would be helpful if in the docs they specified which category (namespace?) functions were in, e.g. `Game`, `Screen`, etc. Sometimes I forget whether a specific function falls under a specific category and I have to scroll back up to where that section is defined. If each function just listed what type it was it would be helpful. For example, instead of:
```npc CreateNPC(int id);            ZASM Instruction: 
                    CREATENPCR
                    CREATENPCV

/**
* Creates an npc of the given type at (0,0). Use the NPC_ constants in
* std.zh to pass into this method. The return value is a pointer to the
* new NPC.
* The maximum number of NPCs on any given screen is 255. ZC will report an
* error to allegro.log if you try to create NPCs after reaching that maximum.
*
*/ Example Use: !#!```

It was something like:
```namespace: Screen
npc CreateNPC(int id);            ZASM Instruction: 
                    CREATENPCR
                    CREATENPCV

/**
* Creates an npc of the given type at (0,0). Use the NPC_ constants in
* std.zh to pass into this method. The return value is a pointer to the
* new NPC.
* The maximum number of NPCs on any given screen is 255. ZC will report an
* error to allegro.log if you try to create NPCs after reaching that maximum.
*
*/ Example Use: !#!```
(Note the extra line of text at the top. If not `namespace`, whatever the appropriate term would be).

I'm not sure how difficult this would be to add, I'm hoping it would be a fairly easy thing to automate but I don't know how the docs are made so I realize how it may be more tedium than is a priority.

The web docs are a better solution to this problem
they aren't complete, and haven't been worked on in a while though\

Oh yeah, didn't consider those since I forgot about them
