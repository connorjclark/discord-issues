Currently the file select has music designed for the title screen playing, and it feels very unprofessional and also annoying. Ideally the music for both the file select and the title screen should be different and be selectable by the user, and file select should default with no music playing; but at the very least the file select should not be playing music for new people.

I can try an idea for reintroducing the title screen, which would let us remove the music from the file select screen  (or possibly replace it with a low key song specifically designed to be more chill, way later)

Yeah, I thought it was weird it wasn't toggle-able

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 22:46

It is.
It's in the launcher to disable the music atm
Anyway, I'll share a video in a bit for an alternative.

With this the `skip title` option would be re-introduced, ofc.

oooh, I like that
thank you!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/07/2024 23:38

anything you want tweaked?
this video randomly desyncs the sound but...the music cue does match w/ the display of that text

=== @ Jared 01/07/2024 23:55

I like it too

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/08/2024 00:01

I think it's fine, but might want to get a second opinion

I like how it says "Press Anything To Start" and it's obviously better than "Press only the "A" Key to Start"  (Ha)  but it's also funny how it just seems unavoidably dismissive.  "Hey there.  Press any damn key to do the thing.  Just mash the ol' keyboard why don'tcha."

Okay, so this is my first time engaging with 3.0, but-
I feel like the title screen music is very... meh?
Like, it's trying so hard to be a Zelda title screen theme and WANTS to be the Zelda theme, but can't cuz of copyright and ends up being middling and inferior. And just sounds wrong because it rises to to the right notes, then backs down at the last second so that's it not the copyrighted theme we all know
I'm not sure where it came from, but it's... really unimpressive, and I feel like it screams "We want to be Zelda but are coming up short," which is, as I understand, the opposite of the intent of 3.0
Also not the biggest fan of having the logo remain on the file select screen. It looks kind of amateurish and detracts from the simplicity of the file select
The effect on the title screen itself is alright, but feels rather drawn out for what's essentially an engine launcher. I feel like the splash screens of older version probably handled it better.
The overall effect just feels like it's really wanting to be LttP, which kinda forces anything built in the engine to live under that likely-unwanted shadow

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/08/2024 19:45

The music came from a commission to a chiptune compose, so it's an original.

=== @ Russ 01/08/2024 19:52

I kinda figured. It feels like someone was asked to make a song that sounds like the Zelda theme for a title theme.
