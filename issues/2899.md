> Oops! I deleted the quest thinking it would refresh the quest save so it would load.  Is there a way to recover the quest progress or am I screwed?

@ cbailey78
You deleted the qst file?
That's not really an issue. just get it back, and set the .qst for the save file again like I said.

=== @ cbailey78 12/09/2023 05:01

Sorry, I meant erasing the quest file in ZC.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 05:01

That'd be a save file, or save slot.
Anyway, .... yes I've protected you here.
Look in the saves/backups.
or maybe it is saves/deleted.
Copy the file from there back to the main saves folder (rename it too, I guess).
Don't just move it, _copy it_ - you've already accidentally deleted stuff.

=== @ cbailey78 12/09/2023 05:11

I got the save file recovered in the save slot.  I still get the error message.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 05:18

oh, you can only reconfgure the qst path if the game hasnt started yet.

=== @ cbailey78 12/09/2023 05:22

Well, it seems like I cannot get the quest to load at all. I've tried all your suggested fixes.  That's a bummer.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 05:24

Just sit back, I'm debugging.

=== @ cbailey78 12/09/2023 05:27

OK

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 05:28

Where is your copy of the qst?
Based on the save file, it should be at `<ZC ROOT FOLDER>/../../RandomizerOmega.qst`
aka, two folders above ZC
is that where you have it right now?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 05:33

(it could also just be one folder above ZC...)

=== @ cbailey78 12/09/2023 05:35

Sorry, what do you mean one folder above ZC?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 05:36

where zelda.exe is
look at that in windows file explorer. This is the ZC folder.
now go up one folder.

=== @ cbailey78 12/09/2023 05:40

The quest is in the ZC folder with all other quests are at and it is where zelda.exe is.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 05:58

OK, your qst is in the right place. otherwise we'd be seeing a different error

this is the Header for the qst you provided
it has no Title
your sav file was saved with a title ("Randomizer Omega") from the qst is was created with
thats what is means by "this does not match"

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 06:02

When I load the latest from https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&id=694 the header Title is present
Did you modify this copy of RandomizerOmega.qst in anyway?
@ HeroOfFireZC was an older version of this qst missing all this info from Header?
@ cbailey78 were you previously able to reload this save file (after playing before), or did you only play it once and when you loaded for the second time it didn't work?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 12/09/2023 06:05

This is the quest header in 2.50.2, where I saved it.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 06:08

This qst file was saved in 3.0

=== @ cbailey78 12/09/2023 06:08

BINGO! IT WORKS!!!  Thanks you so much for your time helping me with this issue.  I cannot thank you enough.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 06:09

sure thing. so did you modify it?
we should improve the error message here
to say "title was: ... but expected: ..."
Also, it seems like there's a. bug that resulted in all these header info being cleared away...

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 12/09/2023 06:13

Given what was discussed, I went and saved a new version of the quest in the latest nightly, and the Header info is untouched (besides updating the Quest Made in version obviously), so unsure how that got cleared.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 12/09/2023 06:14

Hold on, version 3.0?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 12/09/2023 06:15

Perhaps this info clearing only happens in these new 3.0 builds? I have not looked into them yet, still looking over all the stuff in 2.55 I've been glossing over.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/09/2023 06:19

possibly! I'll check it out

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/10/2023 01:32

Resaving in 3.0 is fine.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/10/2023 01:38

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "sure thing. so did you modify…"): @ cbailey78 did you modify / save the qst in some weird way?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 08:59

@ cbailey78 ^

=== @ cbailey78 12/15/2023 01:27

I opened a tileset and removed the header.  My issue has been solved.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/15/2023 01:30

What does removing the header do tho?
I'm wondering why you'd do that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 06:19

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I'm wondering why you'd do th…"): they're saying that they removed the header, so it now matches the save file, and can load?
so, still not seeing an explaination for what caused this in the first place...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2024 06:39

Removing the header is what caused the issue. When a save is loaded it checks the saved `title` with the quest file's title. When they don't match, it fails. https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/02bc0f4ffba35b6bd81fbdc3e783f2574b543885/src/zc/zelda.cpp#L1533
the save must have been started w/ the qst file/header intact, then the qst was opened in the editor and the header cleared, which then fails this check

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2024 06:41

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Also, it seems like there's a…"): I was confused too,  but when I looked at this and tried to repo the header being cleared from 2.55->3.0 all was fine.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2024 06:46

ahk, fair, just a bit confusing lol
(I've just been running through the whole buglist a bit and cleaning up)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/03/2024 06:47

godspeed
