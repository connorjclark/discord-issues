Right in the title.

Would screenshots help, you think, Jared?
Of the room with and without flags and layers.
Maybe even of the combo types and settings of the chest combo.

Fwiw...

For myself, bug reports like this are not something I'd investigate because I'd want a qst I can download and quickly get at a reproduction. Doing that setup myself is not ideal.
It also reduces back/forth from something being related to certain QRs being enabled or not, or any other minutiae that could be required to observe the bug.

Oh okay! No problem

Thanks!

I'm walking into a museum now though üòÇ
Will be very useful for later

=== @ Jared 10/30/2022 12:15

As far as I know, it's a normal chest so no problems there
No problem!
No rush! I just got out of work and I'm just fiddling around anyways lol

Kind of an older build, looking at it. You guys work so quick nowadays that it's easy to fall out of the build loop lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/30/2022 12:46

@ Jared try updating
I fixed at least one thing that might be related to this since then

=== @ Jared 10/30/2022 12:54

Updated, sadly still broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/30/2022 13:47

PAHAH
K
So, uh
it only breaks if you push a block over where the chest is supposed to spawn
because... that's deleting the secret flag. @ Jared
And no, that is NOT a bug.... it needs to replace the secret flag with the push flag when the block enters that space.
I recommend this:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1036248020326559795/1036275530422558850/unknown.png?ex=65e47fcb&is=65d20acb&hm=ddd9d682f6b035ca6ae99100288a7daa5434f5ec9bca3b362bd2f0d5dd496f32&)
(enabling the top/bottom one there)
and then place your pushblocks on layer 1
(the top one is required for pushblocks on layers to work)
(the bottom one makes it so the blocks don't "lock into place" until every block on screen is on a trigger, allowing you to push blocks OVER triggers)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/30/2022 13:51

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "it only breaks if you push a‚Ä¶"): I'm not surprised you didn't catch this though, the way your puzzle is set up you will almost surely push a block over that space at least once
....you could also solve this by placing the CHEST on layer 1 and not needing any of the rules
but, I generally would suggest using the layer stuff for pushblocks anyway, it's cleaner
and prevents the pushblocks from needing to have one undercombo for the entire room

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/30/2022 13:59

ZC is one big bug, confirmed

=== @ Jared 10/30/2022 20:08

I'll try putting them on layer 1! Thank you

=== @ Jared 10/30/2022 20:11

Those quest rules and layer 1 worked! Thank you @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)  ‚ù§Ô∏è
