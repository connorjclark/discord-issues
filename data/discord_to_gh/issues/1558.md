Don't even ask me the about this screen layout, I dun wanna talk about it 😭 

Anyways, wrote up some basic enemies that I wanted to be constrained to water and the water on my screen is layered. I realized ghost.zh doesn't respect layered water, turned to npcscript, npcscript doesn't respect it either 🤣

probably easy to fix
I made the thing that checks water for all layers a function
