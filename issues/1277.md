Shot Types:
-3-way spread
-5-way spread
-4-directional

Flags/Attributes
-Only Appears On Initial Spawn Point (LTTP/LA wizzrobes. Applies to Teleporting only. Will always pick its spawn point for every time it appears)
-Can Be Knocked Back (idk if this works by setting the knockbackability via scripts)
-Kind Phasing (Phasing only. When phasing, refuses to phase in any of the 3 8-way directions closest to Link and will keep rerolling until it gets one of the five others. This prevents a Wizzrobe to the face)
-Summoners Kill Children When Dead - Enemies are "owned" by the Wizzrobe that summoned them. When the Wizzrobe dies, they die too. Perhaps should also apply to walking enemies, but if it can't it's no biggie. Most summoning enemies I've seen people make are Wizzrobes
-Summon Fixed Amount of Enemies: Instead of summoning 1-3 enemies at random, always summon an amount of enemies equal to the value in the next attribute.
-How Many Enemies To Summon: See above. Useless unless the above flag is checked

The last four attributes would make Blue/Fire/Mirror and Bat/Summoner Wizzrobes a LOT more tolerable, fair, and able to strategize, especially in low-gear quests or when attempting to beat a late-game dungeon early

Add a wizzrobe weapon firing SFX attribute.

don't enemies have their own shooting sounds now?

Oh, I just discovered we now have custom weapon items, so I can scratch that suggestion.
