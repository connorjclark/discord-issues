this has been happening for me for a while and i kept forgetting to report this one (oops). would probably say it's been happening over the last three months *at least*...

essentially having two different variables with the same name crashes ZQ when it tries to compile. script parser logs the error, but ZQ has to be closed via task manager.
error i get is as follows:
```[INFO] External ZScript Parser

[Info] Compiling the ZQuest buffer...
[Info] Pass 1: Parsing
[Info] Pass 2: Preprocessing
[Info] Pass 3: Registration
[Error] swords\scripts\deedee\solidobjects.z Line 3 @ Columns 11-31 - Error S008: There is already a variable with name __SOLIDOBJ_COUNT in this scope.
```
screen included is how it freezes. everything unclickable

@ DeletedUser can you post the scripts?

just recreating that error message does *not* cause the issue you've described
