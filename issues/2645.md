This was noticed by other players, but sometimes you might want to F6->Save a quest to play it save and not risk a surprise crash. When you return to the File Select, the cursor will be on the topmost quest of that page, instead of the quest you were just playing. This is different from how it used to work, and is annoying if you wanted to sanity save and then resume the same quest.

Fixed for next nightly.
