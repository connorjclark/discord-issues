Accessing ``combodata->TriggerFlags[TRIGFLAG_TRIG_SECRETS]``  via script crashes ZC.
I really hope this is not a problem with the other trigger flags

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/14/2022 15:43

uhh, `TriggerFlags[]`?
it's `TrigFlags[]`
`TriggerFlags[]` is the old bitwise deprecated way that is only size `[3]` and definitely is very out of bounds with that constant

=== @ Orithan 03/14/2022 21:38

So it is
I feel like that shouldn't crash though
Or at the very least give documentation on what it is and that its continued usage should not be supported.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/14/2022 22:58

As a lot of deprecated commands have been, the documentation on its' existence was intentionally removed
mostly because it *does not work fully*
because its' bitwise, it can only hold 18 flags per index
but, internally, there are 32 flags per index
so it can't read half of the flags
....but old scripts could rely on it, so it still compiles.
And aye, shouldn't crash... but Zoria doesn't know how to code.

=== @ Orithan 03/14/2022 23:00

Perhaps we could have something which points out depreciated functions in the event someone wants to modernize their scripts
It doesn't have to be in ZQ at all either

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/14/2022 23:05

(replying to @ Orithan "I feel like that shouldn't cr…"): ....It very much shouldn't crash
it should print `Invalid Array Index passed to 'combodata->TriggerFlags[]: `

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/14/2022 23:06

I see absolutely no reason for it to crash
...oh, wait
I see one reason for it to crash
if you access [TRIGFLAG_BOMB]
but not any other one

=== @ Orithan 03/14/2022 23:09

Why?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/14/2022 23:09

because it was doing `>` not `>=` on an index bound check
so despite the array being size 3
`[3]` would pass the bounds check
and out-of-bounds an internal array
but `[4]` or higher would be caught by the bounds check and print an error
and `[0]`,`[1]`,`[2]` would all be in-bounds
so yeah
`[3]` would probably do weird stuff
which happens to be `[TRIGFLAG_BOMB]`
but anything higher or lower should either error message or work

Apparently fixed by something I didn't think would fix it at all
(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒[CRASH] Accessing TriggerFlags[TRIGFLAG_TRIG_SECRETS] crashes ZC
