Switch Blocks also will not switch combos.
the switch and blocks on the righthand side are normal placed combos. the switch and blocks on the top side of the screen are all FFCs
(Ignore the FFC that slides off the screen I was testing something else)

yeah, a lot of things don't work on ffcs and these were never set up to
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) you're the queen of ffc stuff, right?
