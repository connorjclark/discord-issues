HID controllers have always worked for me in prior versions of ZC up to (and including) 2.55 a106.  Sometime between that build and a109 they have broken and remain broken in a111.
The ZC menu doesn't register their button presses when assigning them in Settings > Controls > Gamepad

=== @ mitchfork 10/25/2022 14:53

copying correct config file entries for binds to zc.cfg doesn't fix it, so it's a problem with reading inputs, not just with the settings menu

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/25/2022 15:11

Does this work?

https://allegro5.org/examples/examples/ex_joystick_events.html
And what about latest nightly

=== @ mitchfork 10/25/2022 15:17

Latest nightly doesn't work
Looks like this link isn't registering anything, either
Just says Joystick: (null)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/25/2022 15:23

Last thing to try:

https://gamepad-tester.com/
Take a snapshot please of the info if it registers

yup, this is detecting it.  Screenshot with one of the directions held down

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Does this work?

https://alle‚Ä¶"): I forgot this demo page has an allegro bug that I've since fixed
The browser version has a different backend (SDL), is that also broke?

=== @ mitchfork 10/25/2022 15:52

Browser seems like it's working üëç

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/25/2022 16:04

Hmm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2022 22:55

*bump*

fwiw here is an old image vs a new image where zc is showing "unused" for the buttons

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 03:53

what causes it to show unused is a mystery

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2022 04:04

Unrelated, those are just button names as provided by the driver, if available.
Unfortch many are unavailable :/
But shouldn't be the cause of any issue

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 04:06

what would cause the driver to report unused in new but not 106/107

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2022 04:06

ahh this pr https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/pull/776 before it was just a number
so you saying at some point, the new a5 code and this button label code worked for you?
I'll grab a controller and see when this broke.

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 04:08

first image is 106/107 may 9

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2022 04:08

so a4

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2022 04:09

oh, the pr landed during a4
My modern xbox gamepad worked with a5 :/
Last i checked.

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 04:13

107/108 july 23

so yeah your key button polling is working

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 04:31

so an xbox controller works in new

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 04:37

my ibuffalo pad craps out on my windows 11 machine here

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 05:08

im guessing this is a directinput issue?
xbox uses xinput

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 17:27

titanium's issue is ps5 controller which also i believe uses directinput
anything non windows native/xbox

=== @ mitchfork 11/29/2022 20:24

HID is also DirectInput I believe
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xinput/directinput-and-xusb-devices

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 20:40

forcing directinput in the allegro5.cfg is working for me

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 20:41

which breaks all of xinput üôÇ

=== @ tim 11/29/2022 20:43

commenting out the line makes both work
fuck you windows
jesus christ
```driver=XINPUT```

=== @ mitchfork 11/29/2022 20:51

ooh
I'll have to try

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2022 20:57

(replying to @ tim "commenting out the line makes‚Ä¶"): Wow good find!
I guess the default is "use whatever is supported"
Will kill that line with fire

=== @ NightmareJames 11/29/2022 23:24

Reporting that a new player is trying to install Zelda Classic and running into the same issue with a PS4 Pad hooked up to Bluetooth

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2022 23:40

quite literally there is a fix that the player can apply above, right now
(replying to @ tim "```driver=XINPUT```"): delete this line in allegro5.cfg and report back

=== @ NightmareJames 11/30/2022 01:09

He's playing SFV right now, but we will when we get a chance

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 03:22

Next nightly will have this configuration default removed.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 04:11

@ mitchfork did this fix work for you?

=== @ mitchfork 11/30/2022 04:19

Yes, and confirmed fixed in the nightly just posted

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 04:20

nice, thanks
@ naturesucks good job fam
