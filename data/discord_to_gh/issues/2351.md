Pretty sure Misc Colors is an ancient menu that hasn't been touched in decades so IDK how feasible this one is, but currently the continue screen uses a hardcoded color 0. In most situations this is a nonissue but there's two cases where I think it should be custom:
-In EZGBZ's palette structure, 0 and 1 are the _same color._ This is a gross oversight with the tileset's design that renders the text on the continue screen invisible by default. If you were to say change one of these colors? Oops! That messes up things on the subscreen. Point is it's messy and requires some annoying first time setup to use, but this is also one of the most commonly used tilesets. 🤦 
-Second reason is to do with 8-bit tiles. A lot of the time, a vast majority of cases, those tiles will have black outlines. You ideally want to be able to see those outlines against the transparent color. So it might make sense to make color 0 pink so it stands out against anything, right? Oops! Game Over screen's pink now. 🤦

Appears the text in the game over uses Message Text and the flashing color when making a selection uses Caption. That's not the most intuitive thing but at least those are modifiable

=== @ P-Tux7 04/30/2023 21:51

Huh. I think the background should just copy the subscreen background misc. colour
Since IIRC that's used for all other "black" things (warp wait screen, Triforce cutscene, Zelda rescued) except for fades (Z1 staircases, dark rooms)

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2023 21:52

is it really? wow

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2023 21:53

Hmm, triforce cutscene seems to use 0
Zelda flag also uses 0

=== @ P-Tux7 04/30/2023 21:54

oh great

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2023 21:54

And blackout warp...also 0
Seems there's more hardcodes than I figured

=== @ P-Tux7 04/30/2023 21:54

okay so, i think this should just be an internal compat thing to use colour 0 for all old quests, and quests from here on out use whatever is set as the subscreen background
doesn't make much sense imo to have a different value for every one

=== @ Moosh 04/30/2023 21:55

Tilesets might not necessarily have subscreen background set to something sensible though, keep in mind
let's see what EZGBZ does...
pff

So for out of the box tileset usage, making it use subscreen background doesn't make the most sense
A quest rule that makes them use system black could work?

=== @ P-Tux7 04/30/2023 21:57

oh right, that'd make it fade to beige, whoops
does system black have a misc. colour yet
"#000000" is getting into truecolour draw territory and *yuck* (unless one of the last few csets reserves #000000)

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "does system black have a misc…"): "System Black" means the black color that is not part of your QUEST'S palette, so no, that would not be a misc color

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 07:41

(replying to @ Moosh "Pretty sure Misc Colors is an…"): ```cpp
//SaveScreenSettings[SAVESC_BACKGROUND] = BLACK;
SaveScreenSettings[SAVESC_BACKGROUND] = 0; //Isle of Rebirth changed the game over background by changing color 0 of the palette; this needs to be respected!
```So, it looks like Zoria thought about this when designing the script ability to modify the save screen... and decided keeping old behavior default for compatiblity was important.
...Making this default to a new misc color (which defaults to 0) instead of 0, would preserve compat while letting it be set in ZQ.

=== @ Moosh 05/01/2023 07:45

Excellent
I also had no idea this was a script accessible. huh

`Game->GameOverScreen[GOS_*]`
