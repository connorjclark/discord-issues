re: https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/pull/774

I'd like to discuss merging this to the main branch. I've built on top of this branch for 1) the mac build and 2) the web build, and would like to upstream this work to reduce some burden on my end re: rebasing. Also, it'll be much easier moving forward with some other work I want to do, such as 64 bit support on windows / trying to improve vsync / etc.

To start, it'd be great if others can check out this branch and confirm they can still build, as I made some non-trivial changes to the CMakeList and want to confirm I'm not breaking anyone's setup.
