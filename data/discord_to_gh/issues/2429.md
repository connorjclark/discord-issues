When testing FFC movement (by pressing C in preview mode) all combo animations stop.
This only affects Zquest

Specifcally, I want  to know if this was working in a previous version.

Works in 2.50.2

....works in the latest build I happened to have built, as well, though?
though the `Show FFCs` outline doesn't update properly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/08/2023 20:58

rebuilt in latest and it works fine for me, aside from the `Show FFCs` outline not updating

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/08/2023 21:06

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "though the `Show FFCs` outlin…"): fixed this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/08/2023 21:07

err, oh, wait, COMBO animations stop
....when you toggle the preview mode thing that says toggle combo cycling?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/08/2023 21:10

yeah, yeah, that should be running cycling but it isn't ok
and that did used to work

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 21:23

gotta zero-initialize arrays
fixed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 21:45

it is, was about to push but ya beat me to it

=== @ Tabletpillow 06/08/2023 23:37

I downloaded the lastest nightly, (the second 6/8 one) and still came across the error.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/08/2023 23:38

I think that one was already building when this was fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/08/2023 23:39

Yeah, 5:47 the nightly came out, and they take like 40 minutes to build
So, next nightly after that one will have it

=== @ Tabletpillow 06/08/2023 23:40

Oh alright, got it. Thanks
