Darkness appears over text screen game messages.
This is the darkness used with the New lantern features.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/24/2021 22:17

Regular Text boxes are all covered and you cannot read them in a room.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/25/2021 04:17

I just started a New quest too.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/25/2021 23:03

I was right, it is doing this for some reason.

I created an entirely new quest and it does this.   Is there a quest rule doing this maybe?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/25/2021 23:12

Oh wait, ...
I just downloaded a Fresh one
it did the exact same thing.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/25/2021 23:16

it still does the exact same thing, even with a fresh download of the latest build.

I just tried this rule  New Darkness Draws Under Layer 7.
I reset the game and tested, .... it failed.

you need new darkness to draw under layer 7
and again
make sure you are on the latest build
I know this works
because I *literally fixed this bug within the last couple days*
if it isn't working in the most recent posted build
then you'll need to wait for the next build
but this bug *has been fixed*
@ SkyLizardGirl

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/26/2021 04:34

I am on the very latest build
The latest one you have out.

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 12/26/2021 04:35

i even re-downloaded the latest 2.55 Alpha to retest on a new quest.
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "if it isn't working in the mo‚Ä¶"): Oh ok
I was worried..
i was trying to test a dungeon, i could not see what the text was telling me.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2022 20:34

@ SkyLizardGirl test on the latest nightly or alpha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/03/2022 03:23

?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/03/2022 21:03

It's In Options?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/03/2022 21:03

Should be a qr mentioning darkness and layer 7

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/03/2022 21:03

Am looking for this now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/03/2022 21:03

Probably under the misc tab, near the end?

What have you done with the quest rules

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/13/2022 05:56

Nothing
It‚Äôs on darkness

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:56

. . . `it's on darkness` does not tell me what is and is not checked
is new darkness checked?
is new dark under layer 7 checked?
What is set

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/13/2022 05:57

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:57

`Yes` as an answer when I asked two separate questions

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/13/2022 05:57

Ok
Now it‚Äôs working
But
For some reason

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:58

What was it before?
I need you to actually answer my questions
or I can't help

What is checked
screenshot the quest rules

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/13/2022 05:58

For some reason some rooms are not dark when i made certain screens dark
does this only do this if a certain rule is unchecked or checked?

Otherwords the messages over the darkness works now
Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 06:03

Where are they, and what are their settings?
(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl ""): this at least appears to be fixed

I am removing the torches
hold on

Ok now there are no torches
but the room is still not dark

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 06:05

on any layers, including on ffcs?
Is anything in that room being drawn by script?

what does that have to do with torch combos

Thats the only ffc
i removed the two torches that were in a picture above

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 06:07

I was asking if you had torch combos on any layers or ffcs
so if the ffc isn't a torch
it has nothing to do with what Ia sked

That's....
That's the transparent color.
So your darkness is invisible.

Oh?
Oh ok
hold on
which color is it supposed to be?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 06:10

You should leave the darkness selected on the default (the black on the bottom row, 3 from the right) if you want it to be pure black
that is always black in ZC, regardless of tileset

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/13/2022 06:11

Very bottom row ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 06:11

yes

3 to the right?
