Ability to switch subscreen types using an Ex button 4 in game.  You could make at least 3 different subscreens that can be used for different things optional for your game, kinda like how Ocarina of time has 3 or 4 different subcreens to switch through, only you could do this in ZC. This would Allow room to put more optional stuff in the game, such as Maps and more items etc.
