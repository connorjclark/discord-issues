Say I've selected this tree here to stamp to the screen

It comes out looking like this

And the reason is made clear when I open the combo page. It's getting cut off because it crosses the bottom of the page.

(meta) thread name was changed: Combo stamp not working across combo pages

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 05:31

Is this just new quest? I can't seem to reproduce this using the big tree.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 05:34

Guess you have some other quest there. I can repro using new quest with this silly 2x2 combo selection

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 05:36

Aside, any reason to stick to the weird 256-per-page thing the combo list is doing?
Like, would changing that mess with peoples muscle memory or whatever
mhmmm tilesets are probably designed with it in mind, so nvm.

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2023 05:50

I inserted a bunch of combos so it'd do it with the big tree

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2023 05:52

A lot of tilesets including one I'm working on are designed around the awkwardly sized combo pages. I wouldn't be distraught if they were resized but it's probably not worth it yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 06:09

how does toggling whatever mode Space does change things? Space toggles a bool called `combo_cols` in the code but I can't make out what it does really.
Not sure if the stamping being broken in _that_ mode is a bug or not.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 06:11

Other than that, this is fixed now.

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2023 08:09

Oh that's simple. Pressing space screws up the combo table organization and renders it an unusable mess until you press it again. Which is to say orders the combos in rows instead of columns

It's only visible in Quest->Graphics->Combos (though the hotkey still functions when you're not in this view to mess with new users)
So yeah, not the fondest of that feature. If there's anybody who's found a use for it I'd love to know why it exists

=== @ Russ 06/10/2023 10:32

Yeah, I find that feature to be the least intuitive thing in the wold
I sometimes press space expecting it to work like in the tile page, letting me select a block of combos rather than all combos between a start and end number
And then remember "Oh right, this program's awful"

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/11/2023 21:10

Do you want us to remove it? Ask around a bit and see what use it has. Some things we could do:

- have some sort of indicator on the main screen of which mode you are in
- ... or make this state not a thing outside of the Combo Page. What purpose is there for the combo drawing to be affected by this mode?

=== @ Russ 06/11/2023 21:22

I think it'd be useful to remove _if_ it could be replaced by a better feature. I'm not sure what it's called, but the corresponding option in the tile pages, where you can swap between a linear list of tiles when you mass select vs a rectangular block of tiles

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/11/2023 21:28

What if selecting combos by default with the draging option works like the 2x2 stamp thingy, but if you want a linear selection you would 1) click a combo and 2) shift click another. That's a standard UI convention.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/11/2023 21:29

That drops the combo column mode from mattering in the draw view. Can keep mode (and space to toggle it) for just for the Combo Page window.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/11/2023 21:31

btw this is what it looks like right now. Left side is correct, right is the buggy version after toggling Space (totaly busted)

=== @ Russ 06/11/2023 21:33

... wait hold on
Can you create a large paintbrush by just... dragging in the column window like that?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/11/2023 21:33

Yeah, that's the bug I'm discusing rn.
This mode which you only probbly knew existed in the Combo Page
also affects this behavior when drawing combos

=== @ Russ 06/11/2023 21:34

My dumb ass was thinking this was about combo aliases
Didn't even know this was a thing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/11/2023 21:34

In a way that just doesn't even make sense (perahps it was always buggy)
Maybe a linear selection here doesn't even make sense and we should just stop doing the buggy thing no matter what column mode the combo page uses

=== @ Russ 06/11/2023 21:35

Honestly, proabbly for the best
You can still do linear selections if you have a block select, after all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/11/2023 23:08

(replying to @ Russ "I think it'd be useful to rem…"): To do this in the combo pages would be difficult, the copy/paste/move/insert logic is entirely different for the different shape selection
but for combo brushes, yeah, that was added a while back by request

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/15/2023 01:23

Bump

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/29/2023 06:57

@ Moosh related to your current effort?

=== @ Moosh 08/29/2023 06:59

Oh this is still a thing? Think this is kinda near some of the code I'm changing in ZQuest.cpp but I don't think overlaps

=== @ Moosh 08/29/2023 07:01

this definitely seems like one I could handle, though wanna focus on my main project first

=== @ Moosh 08/29/2023 07:02

err wait, it's flagged as fixed already?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/29/2023 15:18

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Do you want us to remove it?…"): original bug was fixed but there's this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/05/2023 19:36

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Do you want us to remove it?…"): point 2 here seems best
