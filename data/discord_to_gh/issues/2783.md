I was told by Emily to file this since I found a consistent setup for breaking transparency in ZQ.
Step 1) Have a screen set to any palette other than palette 0. Make sure there is something semi-transparent on that screen, like a translucent layer or Z3 darkness.
Step 2) Create an adjacent screen, starting with palette 0, then set it to the first screen's palette.
Steo 3) Return to the first screen without visiting any other screens that use a different palette. This should consistently break the translucency table, which is fixed by rebuilding the table or switching to a blank screen and back.

(replying to @ Phosphor "I was told by Emily to file t…"): So uhhh... what specific palette are you using in this area?
because I'm having trouble replicating the issue following these steps
even using a section from a build of your quest that I have

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:01

....and looking at the section of code I would expect to find an issue in, I find exactly the code I would expect to find handling this exactly the correct way, last edited 8 years ago by Gleeok in `Initial Commit` of the repo....
...hmm, except
with these specific steps, maybe the problem would be somewhere there instead?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:07

no, every single time you close the F4 dialog, it rebuilds the trans table
so that doesn't make sense...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:13

and that is not something new, that's been there over a year

deedee, in august 2021
so

=== @ Phosphor 11/01/2023 05:18

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "So uhhh... what specific pale…"): Palette A

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:18

HAHAHAHAHA
IT'S THE LEVEL PALETTE SHORTCUTS SPECIFICALLY
If you use the F4 menu it never bugs
because, as I said, that was literally patched by deedee a year and a half ago
but no one patched the level palette shortcuts
which, like, are ***disabled*** by default

=== @ Phosphor 11/01/2023 05:19

Disabled by default but used by literally everyone anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:19

so of course we didn't catch it lol
(replying to @ Phosphor "Disabled by default but used…"): err, no
used by literally no one
There being a checkbox to disable them exists for a reason
because accidentally pressing them was far too much of a problem
and people were annoyed that a feature that ***no one used*** caused that much trouble

=== @ Phosphor 11/01/2023 05:20

Except I've seen multiple people complain about it being off by default???
in a denied feature request from like 2 months ago

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:21

(replying to @ Phosphor "Except I've seen multiple peo…"): where was this?

=== @ Phosphor 11/01/2023 05:21

Oh I could have sworn it was a thread people discussed it in and it was denied
but it's just an unassigned request by coolgamer
https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1162922316653670510/1162922316653670510

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:22

also that's not saying to enable them
it's saying that the checkbox is no longer needed
because we can just assign them to `(None)` hotkey by default
instead
now that hotkeys are configurable
instead of needing a hardcoded checkbox specifically for these things
so, still does not say what you thought it did
you may well be the only person to use these lol
*especially* the 0-9 button ones
people ***HAAATE*** those

=== @ Phosphor 11/01/2023 05:23

I mean i don't see why people wouldn't when you need to hold ctrl or shift to do anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:24

(replying to @ Phosphor "I mean i don't see why people…"): that was a change that I made when hotkeys became configurable

=== @ Phosphor 11/01/2023 05:24

I have the number ones turned off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:24

it used to be 0-9 without any ctrl/shift

=== @ Phosphor 11/01/2023 05:24

I'm aware

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:24

so, that was a much bigger problem
anyway
aside from the point

=== @ Phosphor 11/01/2023 05:25

I'm pretty sure people do use ctrl or shift and + or - to navigate palettes though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:25

(replying to @ Phosphor "I'm pretty sure people do use…"): (given that those are disabled by the feature that people were requesting a lot, I don't actually think so- not a lot of people anyway)
but anyway
this should be stupid easy to fix
....but also
........why don't I just put the rebuild in `zmap::setcolor()` instead?
............that would catch all of these spots, AND theoretically any other spot in existence?
the only place it would even be possibly "slow" to run this is in the F4 dialog because it would be doing it every time
.....but it would need that anyway thanks to the feature that lets you preview it in the background.....
so, yeah, this just seems like the obvious fix that would stop this issue from ever happening ANYWHERE again?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 05:55

k, should be fixed permanently, finally.
(replying to @ Phosphor "I was told by Emily to file t…"): thanks for the report ❤️
