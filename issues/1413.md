Version: Alpha 103, Nightly 18/2/22
Operating system: Windows 10

Checking "Cannot use from X Side" stops you from using the signpost.

The top one says "Cannot be activated standing to the right if checked."

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:05

Which appears to be at least a mismatch from what listed in the combo editor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:06

...the help text is definitely typoed

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/944896850589278258/944897914654847006/unknown.png?ex=65e44bc2&is=65d1d6c2&hm=3b4dc1804d71134a6c3e6f350efbb8008d84cc828ddcd4a3272c476a432f0542&)
that uh
is definitely setting index 8 4 times
instead of index 8 through 11
oh, that's on chests
...probably copy+pasted
aye
but, that'd only be visual

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:09

Checking only `Can't use from top`, I can use it except from the top
Adding `Can't use from left` disables just the left

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:10

Something else is going on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:10

...and then adding `Can't use from right` disables just the right.
so, can't recreate any mechanical issue
What is `Button` attribute set to?
And what is `String` attribute set to?

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:12

Button is set to 1
String is set to 1

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:12

and you're using `A` to try to read it, I presume?

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:12

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:12

that's literally exactly what I just set up
and it works fine
Compat QRs?
I wouldn't think any should affect this

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:13

Other signposts I have are working

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:13

hmm
Any scripts running on the screen?
Is large link hitbox enabled/disabled?

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:14

Disabled

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:14

hmm
is the combo accidentally cycling to something else
that looks the same
but isn't a sign?
(at the point of stupid ideas)

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:14

Is not cycling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:15

If you set your ruleset to `Modern`, does it start working?

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:16

No

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:18

I, uh
have no idea
no problem on my end, so I can't exactly debug it
Is a message already on screen, or is `Hero->Z > 0`?
Are there bridge combos at all involved?

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:20

No
If I copy the data from a signpost combo that worked, it actually works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:20

. . . wHAT
Screenshot every tab of your nonworking combo for me, if you could?
because that indicates that you've definitely done SOMETHING wrong in setting it up
but your attributes sound fine

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:31

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:31

ah
that'd do it
the green effect square is completely empty on the first tab

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:32

...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:32

so, all 4 corners of the combo are acting as `(None)` type

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:32

That didn't cause issues when I first made the combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:32

That certainly should have
any area that is not green acts as `(None)` instead of the combos type
been like that for, like, gotta be at least a year by now?

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:34

It was working when I first worked on the quest.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:35

Did you set the green square off accidentally at some point after?
Also, what's the state of `Quest->Compat->4->Old Bridge Combo Behavior`?
that fucks with green square stuff, though I wouldn't expect it to make a difference without bridge combos involved...

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 10:36

It's turned on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 10:43

Same as mine
So,  <:nkoShrug:585925548245647420>
It working with the green square OFF would definitely be a bug
As is the help text being fucked up, but that was an easy fix at least

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 11:22

Effect squares turned on, same result

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 11:22

??
Immediate question, reload the quest in ZQ; did the effect square uncheck itself?

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 11:29

Nope

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 11:31

what the fuck
what you have screenshotted
plus green square
should display string 41
from any side
on pressing A

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 11:35

The only way I can explain this is if there is random data corruption

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 11:36

I would immediately be very scared that it's the string stuff
but that isn't posted anywhere yet

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 11:36

This was before the string stuff was a thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 11:36

exactly

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 11:36

I was having this issue in a100

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 11:36

and I have no clue what else would have done data corruption

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 11:41

I'll send you the file

=== @ Orithan 02/20/2022 11:57

I reverted to an earlier QB and it somehow now all worked
Some spooky gremlins were at work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 12:04
