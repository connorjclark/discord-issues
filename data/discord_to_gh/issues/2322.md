A SCC for a `RunFrozen` `generic` script, allowing a script to run the frame the SCC is placed in the string (like the beginning or end of a string, or even in the middle of a word)

The fun thing about `RunFrozen` is it runs in it's own pocket dimension of time
so, yeah, this makes perfect sense and shouldn't honestly be that difficult

```
\136\generic_script_id\force_redraw
    - Runs a generic script in the Frozen mode (see 'genericdata->RunFrozen()')
      If 'force_redraw' is not '0', it will force the whole screen to be redrawn
          before running the frozen script.``` @ vlamart
