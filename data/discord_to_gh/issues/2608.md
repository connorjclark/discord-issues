> Address Sanitizer Error: Deallocation size different from allocation size

in `SubscrPage::clear()`

Issue is that the dtor needs to be marked as virtual. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/294932/2788187

. . .what? Why would `SubscrPage` need a virtual destructor?
It's neither a parent nor child class, it stands on its' own

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 20:26

The widgets.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/27/2023 20:26

is it not smart enough to handle that on its' own? they all use default destructor....
`~SubscrPage` is literally the only non-default destructor

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 20:28

No, the compiler cannot assume that a class deconstructor may be overridden in some other class. It can't know all the things that might extend it. That's the point of virtual, to mark something as needing dynamic dispatch at runtime
You may have defined everything in the same header / compilation unit, but the language doesn't account for that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/27/2023 20:29

so default destructors are absolute idiots that need to be babied?
good to know

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 20:29

Otherwise every dtor would have a dynamic dispatch overhead
This is inherent in the design of any language with both independent compilation units, and class inheritance
Without some link time whole program analysis

The default constructor/destructor stuff seems so smart, it just baffles me that it misses this basic thing
like I totally understand needing to declare it virtual if I have declared a destructor
but if I don't declare it I shouldn't need to touch it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 20:31

It's not really missing. It's a choice in the language that  results in the majority of code not paying for the cost of class hierarchies
Ideally we could find a compiler warning that told us of this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/27/2023 20:31

I mean, I would think it should be smart enough to tell that the class is overridden in the same file and needs virtual destructor

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 20:32

That's just not how cpp standardization is approached

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/27/2023 20:32

yeah, seems stupid

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 20:32

It'd be way complicated
Difference behavior based on how you split up compilation units, I think they avoid that for reasons

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/27/2023 20:48

fixed
