noticed both of these last night - same build as the music bug (2.55 a103)
first one is the link holding item sprite.
second is that link can't walk out of the room after entering it. i've tried to replicate these in a normal instance of ZC, but they only seem to happen in test mode.

unlike the previous link holding an item bug, the sprites are unchanged in ZQ:

???
Test mode only skips the damn file select
it shouldn't affect anything else
the music on respawn touches code in the same area as the code to return to file select and such
so that one at least makes some sense
but.... hold sprites, and not being able to walk out of a room??

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2022 01:17

i did notice the invisible wall thing last week too, but it isn't occurring in the same places anymore. updated to this new build yesterday

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2022 01:17

i'd thought it was something to do with FFCs at first cos it was happening in rooms where i'd had moosh's GB shutters

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2022 02:01

well
i stand corrected about the item hold bug being just test mode

could this be an LTM thing on my end?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2022 02:02

uhh
it could be
though we were having some issues with that sprite recently, so could be something else
but I'd double check your ltms

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2022 02:02

yeah, it was fine until i updated
hmmm

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2022 02:04

looks all ok to me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2022 02:06

what version did you update from?

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2022 02:06

only looks like it's doing it to the two hands hold
uhhh relatively recent, i think like 102

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2022 02:06

hmm
we've been having these issues longer than that
also, is it only broken in ZC, or is it un-setting the tile in ZQ?

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2022 02:06

i also haven't been using zc that much the past month or so
only zc, it isn't un-setting the tile like that old bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/24/2022 02:06

ok
<:nekoshrug:869489800271503400>
this is weird

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2022 02:07

the old bug would reset it to the heart + x sprites too iirc right

=== @ tacochopper 02/24/2022 02:10

just for reference for one hand

...are you on the right dmap?
@ DeletedUser

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 01:14

that feels to me like something that would happen due to an improper dmap offset
i.e. you're trying to walk off the edge of the dmap, so it becomes a wall

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2022 01:34

actually, could be dmap 2
uh
the b-2 dmap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 01:34

(replying to @ tacochopper ""): if you could split this into a separate report, that'd be good, since it isn't test-related

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2022 01:34

oh that was test related
but i'll split it if you want

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 01:35

did you actually look at what I replied to?

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2022 01:35

oh no lol sorry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 01:35

lol

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2022 01:35

speed reading and not checking properly oops
30 years of SHIT habits I tell you

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 01:36

As for the screen thing, make sure you're on the right dmap and see if it still happens
because that's exactly what dmap shenanigans would cause

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/26/2022 07:11

(replying to @ tacochopper ""): @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I think they said this specific instance happens in test mode, but not ZQ
which is important cause they go into a cave, which would change the dmap and thus set it's offsets

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2022 11:30

@ DeletedUser test again with the build in #1419
see if that fix magically fixes this too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2022 18:06

(replying to @ tacochopper ""): might have a fix for this?
And at that, a fix coded by neither myself nor deedee
