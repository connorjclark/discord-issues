Doesn't fill all the values, such as combo and velocity.

certainly seems to do so fine for me
(just tested combo, vx, vy, ax, ay)

Can only repro in my z3 branch, not a114. Unexpected as I hardly changed anything in zquest. mhmmm

Strike that, it happens in 114 too. See https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/blob/5f647e9dd3dff9dcd0f15cfc2d1475984fff389a/src/zq/zquest.cpp#L11122-L11129

"Paste FFC as..." works fine, is that what you were trying?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/23/2023 17:48

So I've been reading this as _Paste_ And Edit, not _Place_ And Edit.
So now I understand the purpose here is to place the currently selected combo/cset at the given selection... not Paste and then open the ffc edit dialog :/

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "So now I understand the purpo…"): Yep, lol
