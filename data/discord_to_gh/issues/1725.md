The hint for Four-Way in the ladder item editor states anything over 0 will make it four-way, but in fact it has to be above 1. I was not able to move in a four way manner with it set to 1, but rather 2.

. . . I swear this didn't used to do that
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) did you change something with this?
(Dinner is ready in like, now, so I don't have any time to dig further right now)

I... don't think so?

....I'm being mandela effected here
because that most definitely blames back 7 years to `sort out line endings, hopefully` from Saff, which is initial commit

Fixed the infobox to reflect this
(meta) thread name was changed: ✅Four-Way not working as hint dictates
