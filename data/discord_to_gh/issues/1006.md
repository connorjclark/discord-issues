For some reason, No Diving is a screen flag (I think? might be a quest rule), but it would be neat to have an option for level 1 flippers that can't dive, and level 2 flippers that can. Similar to the Zora's Scale in OOT.

This might already be in 2.55 (if so I apologize).

this was added to 2.55 approximately 3 years ago
IIRC
(meta) thread name was changed: ❌🔒No-Diving Flippers checkbox
