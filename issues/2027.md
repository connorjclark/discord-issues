I'm using ``NPC->MoveXY()`` on an NPC is 3x3 in size and the NPC appears to not be moving past ``X = 160``, which would put the right side of the hitbox against the last 3 combos on the screen.

```
bool advance = true; 
int vx = advance ? 0.5 : -0.5; //Randomize starting direction.
int vy = 0.25*Rand(1, -1); //Randomize starting vertical speed.
do
{
    this->MoveXY(vx, vy, SPW_NONE);
    IA_Waitframe(this, work);
    --time;
} while(time > 0);
```

I'll shoot the devs the replay file.
Instructions to devs - Press F1 to fast forward through the replay file until the Ice Aquamentus comes onto screen.

what's the enemy's hitwidth/hitheight?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 07:42

and the enemy's moveflags

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 08:50

HitHeight and HitWidth are 48
Has ``Can Walk Over Pitfalls`` and ``Can Walk On Liquid`` checked
There are no "No enemy flags"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 08:52

what happens if you check `Can walk through screen edge`?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 08:54

aha

What nightly do I need to use?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:05

latest

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:06

Putting this with base 111 makes it not function

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:06

huh?

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:06

It's not compatible with Base 111

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 09:07

in what way
err
wait
connor changed shit lately that would have been in dlls, duh
so yeah, makes sense
latest nightly should work

=== @ Orithan 11/13/2022 09:13

Appears to be fixed, thanks

Testing this out a bit currently
Since I have quite a few large enemies in James Quest:  Sidestory
