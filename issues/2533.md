Plan on tackling this eventually.

By user data, I mean a users configs, quests, sav files and quest assets. This excludes base configs, shared libraries, and fonts/data files provided by the base install.

OSs give applications their own folders to store user data in. We don't use that for any platform, but we should. Some hacks we do instead:

On Mac, user data is stored within the app bundle. Pretty much no Mac user would think to keep their data there.

On Windows, user data is stored alongside everything else.

On Linux, user data is stored alongside everything else. Instead we should utilize the xdg user directory standard.

The user data folder will be the default folder file pickers use. We should insert a symlink (or equivalent) to the base resources folder (so you can still select the classic quest or packaged fonts, for example)

Once implemented, users won't need to copy their files over anymore for new installations. They should still backup, though.
(meta) thread name was changed: use OS provide app directory for user data

ooof yeah, sounds nice

Could we have an option to disable it? Personally, I find it very annoying when programs do this.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/19/2023 00:41

Not "disable", but yes can provide a user data directory config option which you can set to the install folder if you like
Or just "." for the directory of the executable (same thing)

=== @ Russ 07/19/2023 00:41

Makes sense
As long as I can specify where it’s storing stuff
Similarly, you mentioned including quests in there, but I tend to have my own organization for quests and would definitely prefer those not to be included with configs and whatnot

Linux has a well defined thing for "configs go here, data goes here, state (logging) goes here"...
idk about windows
but i'll look

ZQuest already uses these config options to use specified directories:

- win_data_path
- win_midi_path
- win_image_path
- win_tmusic_path
- (each OS has their own variant)

Player uses this config option to specify directory to look for quests:

- win_qst_dir
- (each OS has its own variant)

When not present (which is the default), we instead use the current working directory. In practice, this means the installation directory (unless you are running from the command line).

I think the change I'd like to make is this:

> When not present (which is the default), we instead use the OS-specified user data application directory.

Another approach is to `chdir` to said user data application directory on start (would have to add a `user_data_dir` config option, and could set to `user_data_dir = .` to effectively keep current behavior). This might result in the least code needing to change (see: how saving a New File relies on Save As to pass an empty string to the file picker, which results in using the cwd...)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/19/2023 01:48

Early init code:

- chdir to where executable is, if not there already (we don't do this today, which is annoying when working from the command line)
- save cwd to variable as `installation_dir`
- check for user-provided data dir,  via presence of `USER_HOME_DIR.txt` in `installation_dir`: if set, chdir to that and make a symlink there pointing to the installation folder. if not, chdir to the OS default application data dir
- now that we are in the user data dir, load their configs. if `user_data_dir` does not match where we are, rewrite `USER_HOME_DIR.txt` and then chdir to it. Don't bother moving anything for the user - that's on them.
- whenever resolving for `base_config` we should do `$installation_dir/base_config/...`

WIndows programs tend to use either the My Documents directory for storing stuff like configs and mods, or AppData/Local and AppData/Roaming for data that is generated rather than included with the installation, the difference of which I think refers to user level vs system level but I'm not 100% on that
