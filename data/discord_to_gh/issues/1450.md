There seem to be string inconsistencies between in-game and ZQ

Just an example

That's odd...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2022 02:03

Do you have any compat rules related to strings enabled?
@ Jared

=== @ Jared 03/08/2022 02:03

I don't believe so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 00:09

(replying to @ Jared "Just an example"): example isn't helpful if I don't know the settings of the string
what font is that? what are your margins? etc

because just typing that doesn't appear to remotely look like how yours fits

Acorn font

hmm
odd

=== @ Jared 03/10/2022 00:13

Yeah, I didn't change much

that certainly fixes it

=== @ Jared 03/10/2022 00:41

omg lol
well yay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 00:42

(it was using the `Top Margin` for all 4 margins in the preview)

=== @ Jared 03/10/2022 00:42

i found a bugggg
lol
Ah okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 00:42

(so, your right margin (which is 0) was being treated as 8)
(thus cutting the word off 8 pixels sooner)

=== @ Jared 03/10/2022 00:42

Ahhhhh makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2022 00:44
