I noticed the help text of the Attack Ring and other similar items specify they only effect swords, wands, and hammers. Would it be possible to add a flag for flames, arrows, and bombs, etc. too?

possibly
but it isn't that they specifically exclude other types arbitrarily
it's that each type is implemented in a completely different block of code
so, it's not a simple addition

If I wanted to script this, would I change the player damage or enemy damage multi in Init Data? Or would it still only apply to melee weapons?

umm
I would have changed the item power for the items you want to effect
but increasing the player damage mult might work just fine too
