Basically, a counter that behaves similarly to the Stun counter but doesn't have any effect on the enemy or weapon, and is only to be read by scripts. It would just be there for the purpose of tidying code. Also it wouldnt have a default setting so it wouldnt add memory. its just to be set for countdown purposes.

"wouldn't be a default setting so it wouldn't add memory"
....that isn't how memory works

I think they mean filesize, but yeah

nothing on sprite objects is saved so nothing there adds filesize
but it will add memory
....not that it's much memory, so

this is probably a good idea
