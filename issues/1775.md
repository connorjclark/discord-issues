New flag for the Auto Scrolling Warp combo types, that turns Link invisible (once he starts being pushed from the combo) and spawns him at the return square (either specified in attribs or side warp settings) as if he scrolled there

Pushed from the combo? What do you mean by pushed
You just mean when link touches the combo?

Yes, I think that's what I mean. Like when the screen scrolls and drags him with it
