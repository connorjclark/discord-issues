In ZC 2.50/2.53, you could type a cheat in the cheat dialog, and pressing Enter would enter the cheat. But in 2.55, you have to manually click "Check". Please allow pressing Enter to check your entered cheat in 2.55.

Seconding. I know this has been brought up many times already. I know the response has been that this change is to make it consistent with others menus. But past a certain point, it makes sense to prioritize convenience, and this is at least the third request for this recently

OK so
Does enter check the code
OR does it close the dialog

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2023 23:30

It does nothing at all
in nightly 12/23 at least
(using that because I started a replay on it)

Hmm, right, because of that fix...
but which SHOULD it be

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2023 23:30

It ought to check the code IMO, because you are "enter"ing the cheat code

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2023 23:31

Type code, hit enter, click the cheat level, click OK
or Type code, click check, click cheat level, hit enter

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2023 23:31

The former

Ahk, that is a doable request.
I destroyed the `onEnter` event in *every single dialog*
because people were complaining about keyboard navigation not working
i.e. if you have a Yes/No dialog
and the Yes is highlighted by default
you press right to select no
you hit enter
.....enter clicks Yes.
So, that was a big problem.
Giving it a specific behavior for here though, seems reasonable enough

Thank you
