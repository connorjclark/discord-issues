A bug that has supposedly been around awhile that I've looked deeper into recently. It appears that Flying-movement enemies can get stuck on the bottom of screens in the 2.55 builds.
The best example are Bats, though I've seen Digdogger Kids, Keese with increased step speed, and even Manhandla's lacking 3 heads do this.
It seems more common the faster the enemy moves, possibly a rounding error in the movement code?
I made a test quest in 2.52 (to confirm this movement bug was introduced later on).

Interestingly, they respect No-Enemy flags and NES dungeon walls.
Slower enemies do not appear to be capable of getting stuck, though surprisingly unmodified Peahats can get stuck.

This came about during a rewrite of enemy collision
and it's a fucking mess

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/06/2021 21:06

Also, on the starting screen, notice how there are No Enemy flags matching the cliffs on the bottom. When they get stuck, they suddenly start moving back and forth on the bottom, ignoring said flags.

....but the same rewrite that caused this issue also is what allows larger than 1x1 enemies to work, like, at all

if you want to try this headache........

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/06/2021 21:07

Best guess, this is just a rounding issue when calculating some sort of "can move" with screen bottoms and higher step speeds.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 21:08

Thank you for rebringing this up
I've been meaning to kill this dead but the report was lost in the old dev server

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/06/2021 21:09

Now, I have been attempting to reproduce a similar looking bug where Bats have a similar "stuck" issue with south-side NES dungeon walls. I saw this behavior while testing a quest for NightmareJames.
They did not stay stuck as long, but also were clearly moving exactly horizontally along the wall for an extended period, something that should be too rare to ever encounter, let alone multiple times.
So, there is a small chance this bug does apply to NES dungeon walls the same way it applies to open screen bottoms.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 22:29

i recall it definitely happened a year ago with moldorms as well
gleeok heads, peahats, and phantoms probably do it too

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 02:14

Besides keeping this relevant and not archived quite yet, I have noticed Bats and Digdogger Kids getting stuck on south NES dungeon walls in one of Nightmare James's quests. Although they don't seem to stay stuck as long, both enemies are clearly moving horizontally along the wall longer than should be plausible. I was unable to replicate this in the test quest though.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/10/2021 02:52

Okay, figured it out. In my test quest, dungeon walls have the "No Flying Enemy" combo type, while in James's quest, the walls are the "None" combo type. When I replace a south wall in my NES dungeon screens with other solid combos that don't have the "No Flying Enemy" combo type, the rules of NES dungeon enemy movement does lead to flying enemies getting stuck on the south "wall" on occasion.
This means both "No Enemy" flags and "No Flying Enemy" combo interactions are correct, while screen bottoms and the invisible NES dungeon bottom wall have the issue.

Reporting in for this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2021 18:54

I'll be looking into this indepth soon
Currently going enemy code for a couple of things

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 18:59

uh oh
uh i mean
hooray!

(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìFlying Enemies Get Stuck at Bottom of Screen
I think I fixed it, but I'm confused as to why the bug happened now when it didn't before

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 17:08

i thought speculation was the addition of enemy size changing messed something up?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 21:24

the problem was that diagonal upleft and diagonal upright were both returning false when on the bottom row but not left/right

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 21:30

and bat enemies always change direction to either of the two nearby directions; left means it's only options are upleft and downleft
exception is when they hit a wall which is why they can escape

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/23/2021 21:31

I assume all the enemies I saw reacting to the bug used this same movement code.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 21:31

yup

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/23/2021 21:31

Manhandla was the most unexpected one.
And Peahats on occasion, which was silly given you don't think of Peahats as a fast moving enemy like Bats.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 22:14

speaking of
i wonder why keese, peahats, and phantom ghinis aren't in a combined class
i know _L_ mentioned he wanted to do that

=== @ P-Tux7 02/16/2022 01:30

oh i should mention i've seen moldorms do this a few times in ZC 2.50.2... but at the *top* of the dungeon playfield. just saw it yesterday
