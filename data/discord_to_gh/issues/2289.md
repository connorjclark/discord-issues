Normally when you select a subscreen you want to edit. The Quest items are displayed in the boxes. But in the latest build. The Items are not appearing. And only the Boxes, Triforce pieces and text are visible. And in the Links awakening subscreens only the bottom of the items at the top row are showing. Here's the version i'm using.

...and just like that report, I am unable to recreate the issue by just opening the subscreen editor:
