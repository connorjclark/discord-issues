I see you have an Items->Secrets screen flag and I think it would be cool to have an Items->Enemies screen flag where enemies don't appear until you pick up the item on the screen.

Seeing that there are all these combinations of screen flags, and maybe it could also be away to consider tiered secrets, by maybe a menu or tab or something organised like:
Event 1 -> Event 2 = screen state 1
Event 3 -> Event 4 = screen state 2
Event 5...
And the events can be a pull-down with item, secret, trigger, enemies, etc., and the screen state can be a check box. So not only could you do Items->Enemies, but also
Items->Enemies [check]
Enemies->Secrets [check]

Keep in mind that adding more memory usage to screens is something we need to be very careful about
