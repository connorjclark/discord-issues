A trigger flag for the combo editor that could be used for push blocks. Triggers the combo when its pushed as the name implies.

hmm, I might actually do `Pushed Left->`, `Pushed Right->`, etc
that could be useful for fancier puzzles/designs
eh, but no, not really
that would help better if you could set *separate* triggers.... bleh
yeah, just `Pushed->` is probably sufficient under the current system
.....I keep getting good ideas for a full combo system rewrite though lol
