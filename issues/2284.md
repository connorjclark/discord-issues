Enemy defences that stun them for half of the typical time and for double the typical time. This is to not only simulate how various enemies in LTTP can be stunned for different lengths of time by different LWeapons, but it also allows for interesting effects such as making the Magic Boomerang more useful via a longer stunning time and the Fire Boomerang less overpowered by making it stun darknuts and wizzrobes for less time. (These latter two are accomplished by making the two boomerangs spoof two custom/script itemclasses and setting the enemy defence reactions accordingly.) This would be especially handy with the "no stunlock" QR and allow for more tactical combat and more varied item usage, even at high levels, than just spamming the fire boomerang to stun enemies.

Me gusta.
This is pretty well thought out, and sounds like it'd be relatively easy to add, too. 🙂👍
