To be more specific when I go to select either the copy or paste (or any of the context menu options in the item editor's item list) it closes the item editor and that's kinda aggravating for someone used to the right then left clicking to copy and paste an entry in the item editor's item list.

Cannot reproduce
ah wait
only occurs after editing an item and going back

.....suddenly I can no longer reproduce, having made no changes (nor recompiled)

@ FireSeraphim are you still able to reproduce this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2023 09:44

It occurred to me earlier today

Right now I'm playing doom
