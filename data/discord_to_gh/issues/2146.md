At some point, the size of the FPS counter, as well as the "Pause" and "Saving..." text, was increased to a rather large size. I often have the FPS counter on during testing, and the new size is pretty distracting. Would it be possible to have an option to go back to the old, less obtrusive size?

Do you think it'd be ideal to make it a fixed size? It currently is proportional to the current window size IIRC.

Perhaps?
