What method are you using to close it?

=== @ Alucard648 10/04/2021 09:34

Close button on top right corner of window.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 11:03

Confirm W10 or user/system specific.
What W10 build? @ Alucard648
Does not occur on W7
will test m W10 tablet

=== @ Alucard648 10/04/2021 11:37

Windows 10 corporate edition. Did nit tested on W7. Happed, probably, after either clicking on Load Module, or Select Save  file button.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 11:39

oh?
It's crashing at the file loader dialog?
...try running it as admin?

=== @ Alucard648 10/04/2021 12:54

File loader works fine, but after using it even once, the error persists on closing ZC. Only redownloading ZC fixes this crash until next using of file loader.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 12:58

....all I can think of is some security program on your computer is flagging something when you use it once
and doing something that causes a crash

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 13:10

could be almost anything
I do not have corporate
and I would need the w10 build number to do real tests

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 13:13

Does 2.55 do the same thing and does Exc key exit or menu exit do it?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 13:14

@ Alucard648

Just tested on 2.55 Tried to open ZCL file loader and boom, crash on evry time you close ZC from now.

@ Alucard648 Is this still a problem in the latest nightly posted in #deleted-channel ?

=== @ Alucard648 02/01/2022 16:08

Bugfix confirmed.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/01/2022 19:20

Okay, good
I recall fixing it in 2.55 but I wasn't sure if I did so for 2.53

=== @ Alucard648 02/02/2022 00:51

2.55 worked fine in this case. Tested 1 week ago.
