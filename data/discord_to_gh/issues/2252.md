ZC Version: 2.55 Alpha 112
Distro: Kubuntu 22.10
ALSA Driver: k5.19.0-35-generic

When opening the zelda or zquest executable no sound driver can be found leaving the sound disabled.
From the allegro log this appears to be a different issue from the reported midi bug on Linux.
In addition to trying out the linux tar.gz I also built from source but the issue persisted.

Relevant info in allegro.log after opening zquest:
```

After looking into it a bit more I realized that ZC 2.50.2 doesn't find the sound driver either.
I now believe this might be related to Ubuntu 22.10 switching to PipeWire.

=== @ fon 03/30/2023 10:46

Installing pipewire-alsa (via pipewire-audio-client-libraries) and configuring it fixes the issue.
However, I now have an "Out of buffers" sound error similar to the other Linux user which results in crackling and echoing for all audio in my case.
So, technically this issue isn't a bug but rather an incompatibility with the audio server bundled with Ubuntu 22.10 and going forward.
Since PipeWire is currently becoming the standard for major distros like Ubuntu or Fedora it might still be a good idea to support it.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/27/2023 02:21

I _think_ `"Out of buffers"` might be a misdirection, I see that often on my ubuntu VM and still here sound just fine. Tho I am on 22.04, I can try updating.

You may have seen this already, but the deal with MIDIs is likely a user-configuration issue: https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=78117&p=1073401

=== @ fon 06/08/2023 01:13

Yes, this indeed fixes the MIDIs not playing at all but now MIDIs have the same constant crackling and echoing sounds like any other sound format while Zelda Classic is running.
I don't have any other apps that rely on Alsa for sound but Alsa Playback with aplay seems to work without any issue over pipewire-alsa.
Another thing: I have *no* crackling issues when running Zelda Classic 2.55 (Alpha 113, the latest one I tried) through Wine. In this case, I only sometimes get slight crackling when other, non-ALSA audio runs at the same time and even then seemingly only for some sound ranges.

FYI we have a flatpak now:

https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876906363756879902/1133152368855359498

Same issues with MIDI though.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 22:53

So the main issue here, sfx not working at all, is handled by the flatpak (IIRC it sets up pipewire for us)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 22:55

The other thing is the extra steps needed for MIDI. we'd have to do a big complex integration of Timidity. I don't see us doing this any time soon, since enhanced music is far more common these days, and the linux install base being so small doesn't warrant me working on it just yet. Given there's a workaround, closing this for now.

=== @ fon 08/07/2023 14:22

The flatpak indeed resolved all the issues I was having and I really don't  mind the workaround with Qsynth. Thanks a lot for your work on finally reintroducing linux support!

One suggestion I still have: Currently the information about the MIDI workaround is a bit unclear for anyone new to ZC on linux, especially now that ZC is available on flathub. I think it might be a good idea to adress the workaround on the distribution channels in some way.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/07/2023 18:33

Good suggestion, I'll add something to the docs/. directory.

How about adding a first time only popup showing a button that opens a local documentation file?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/07/2023 19:57

There's a system in place for popups with "Don't show this again" checkboxes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/07/2023 19:59

I've used it before

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/09/2023 20:00

@ fon wondering if you have any ideas on why this user might have totally broken audio for everything ...

https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/issues/870
I've never come across all audio being broken like that

=== @ fon 08/09/2023 22:58

I actually have Linux Mint 21 installed on a different system. I tried the flatpak and sound worked for me without any issues.

=== @ fon 08/09/2023 23:07

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I've never come across all au…"): Originally, all sound was broken for me on Kubuntu 22.10 until I installed pipewire-alsa. Seemingly, Ubuntu 22.10 and later no longer come with ALSA support by default, so installing pipewire-alsa and configuring ALSA was necessary to get sound in ZC to work at all.
However, Mint 21, 21.1 and 21.2 are based on Ubuntu 22.04 and should still use pulseaudio instead of pipewire by default (though pipewire is also installed).
On Mint 21 I had no issues playing ALSA sound via pulseaudio.

=== @ fon 08/09/2023 23:18

I imagine it could be a different ALSA issue? It might be a good idea to take a look at the Applications tab in "Sound settings" while ZC is running. It should display "ALSA plug-in [zelda]".
