As the title says - you'd think it would use the standard slash sprites, yet it doesn't. It also seems to go back to the "Standing Link" tile even before the net animation has completed and you can move again.

oh, crap

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 22:35

why you pinging me?
Bug net was your doing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/20/2022 22:35

because p-tux mentioned this in the animations thing
and uhhh
I have no clue what would be wrong with animations 😦

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 22:35

I'll fix this if you fix the music looping bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/20/2022 22:36

I would have assumed the attackclk, but that should be >0 for the whole duration?
uhhhh
yeah sure
let me get right on that
it'll only take me a few years


=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 22:36

then this is waiting until I figure out why some songs are only a few seconds long

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/20/2022 22:37

I mean, not rushing this, it's not that important
just putting it on your radar as a thing that is a problem that is existing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/20/2022 22:38

aight

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:41

can you guys copy the animation code from the normal sword slash
the bug net seems a little faster than the sword, but you can either adjust *its* timings or the sword animation's timings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/20/2022 22:43

`copy the animation code from`
hahahahhahahas
hahahahahahhahahahahahahhhhhhahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
that sentence is meaningless
do you mean link's animation or the net animation?
If the net animation, it's literally entirely different
if link's animation, it *is already fucking using the same code*
it sets the attacking action and attackclk

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:45

something isn't adding up the last time i used the bug net
i'll try it in the next nightly and see if it's still looking funny

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/20/2022 22:46

if something's wrong, it's not something as simple as `can't you just copy this from here`
it's probably some jankeryfuckery of the highest order
melee weapons *suck*
link animations *suck*
link actions *suck*
and this relates to all 3, so it *really sucks*

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:47

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "if something's wrong, it's no…"): the framedata (tiles used and how long it takes for each one to go to the next) would at least be of reference i thought
i trust you when you said you copied that from normal slash but it didn't look it last time
like i said, i'll try again next nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/20/2022 22:47

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "the framedata (tiles used and…"): for link or the net?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:47

link

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/20/2022 22:48

it sets `attackclk = duration` and `action = attacking`
that's literally all the net does
and appears to be all any other weapon does
animation stuff is all based on `action`
as for the action animation tiles, none of that is in any code relating to the net
that code is literally not different
that's just link's animation code
shared by *everything*
it's not like the net has some copy of animation setup or anything

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:49

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "As the title says - you'd thi…"): well link certainly doesn't do this when slashing any other weapon

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/20/2022 22:49

aye, so there's probably some absolutely jank fuckery going on
but the actual animation code is shared
there's only 2 copies of link's animation code in the entire source
one of them is ZQ-only, used in the dialog to animate the previews
the other is ZC-only, used for actually displaying in-game
Now, here's a question for you
Does the slash animation for the net last the same length as it does for the sword?
because, I'm pretty sure the net swing is longer

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 22:58

@ P-Tux7
will check in next nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 13:00

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) @ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 06:58

uh is it okay to import my previous quest into this build
i had to add the bug net to the subscreen and i don't want to do it again lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/10/2022 08:43

. . . ?
Why would there be a problem?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 16:39

Better

Link can now no longer move while bug netting and the net changes direction correctly.
However, the animation still starts a frame or two before the net spawns, and it only uses one frame (Slash), as opposed to the Slash + Stab animation for the slashing sword (I included both items in Init Data)

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 16:41

Also observe how Link goes back to a standing pose before the net's animation is even halfway-done, unlike the sword.
So the gameplay is perfect, it's just the animation that needs tuning.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/10/2022 22:12

. . . uhh, wait, something changed?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 22:13

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "As the title says - you'd thi…"): from way back when THIS post was made
you used to be able to move before the visible net disappeared - like you could move before it was even IN FRONT OF link, that early
i recall you saying you fixed that? which it is indeed fixed now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/10/2022 22:22

I uhh
don't recall fixing anything

=== @ P-Tux7 02/10/2022 23:04

must have been deedee

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/11/2022 04:55

um?
I never touched bug net

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/11/2022 04:56

so uh, @ P-Tux7, it fixed itself?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/11/2022 04:57

Hooray?
Now all that's left is animation

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 20:23

So, I think I edited the timing of both the bug net and link's animation while doing it to feel nice
(30 felt way too long; reduced it to 24 and it feels a lot better)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 20:26

There's a bit of an issue though; the bug net when facing right is either the only time the bug net lines up with Link's animation (if left handed), or the only time it *doesn't* line up with Link's animation (if right handed)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 20:29

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) any chance you could have a "unflipped right-facing bugnet" item flag? (so it mirrors the left facing bug net)
I can probably handle the animations from there (though it's looking increasingly likely that I need to implement a slash (continued) link animation v.v)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 23:28

Frankly, do what you like with it, I never want to touch a melee weapon again in my life

=== @ P-Tux7 02/12/2022 23:48

"it's melee not welee"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/15/2022 22:51
