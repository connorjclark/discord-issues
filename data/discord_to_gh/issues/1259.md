Sorry @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) , I don't wanna flood this forum with threads, but there is one last idea, I had a few days ago, when I was making some experiments with your "FreezeWater" LWeapon Script.

I advanced it a little, so it will only change water combos into next, if a certain flag is placed under them, and it can also turn Damage 1/2 herat combos into next, also checking flags.

In fact I think, frezzing water is a good way to move Pushblocks about water barriers.
But the water should be Walk/Swimable (without unchecking "can't Swim in unwalkable Water") 
...and having a (maybe inherent) Flag under all Water "-Edges" and "-Corners" is a waste of Flags IMO.

What if there was a quest rule
"Pushblocks can't be pushed on Liquid" and maybe, even a second "PushBlucks will sink in Liquid"
...Like Blockholes (Block->Next) but using a constant combo or clipping.

Just BTW, I added a combo data script, to turn the screen's undercombo into melting (cycking) ice->water combos, if they appear on assigned "CF_FREEZEWATER" flags.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 00:33

oh, this is a side effect of non-solid water, right
oh while we're at it
smart pushblocks check all 4 quadrants of the combo for solidity, right

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:34

I think so, ye

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2021 00:34

...`smart pushblocks`?

If that's set, they can't be pushed into solids

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:35

But the Water shall not be solid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2021 00:35

yeah, that seems interesting
didn't think about that

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:35

And "Can't swim in solid Water" needs to stay checked

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:37

So Link shall be be enabled to swim in walkable water,but not in solid
...but pushblocks shall not be pushed onto any liquid (solid, walkable or lava)
...or else, you can decide to push em on, but they sink in it 🙂

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:45

Maybe it can be an attribute of the water combo, instead of a questrule?

...so, the pushblocks will not have to check the water, the water will check the pushblocks...?

The Water combos could possibly have an attribute "No PushBlocks"
or "Push Blocks will sink".

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 00:52

...cause, if only the side- and edge water combos will check the pushblock position and push state, they will only have the chekc (max) two (min) one edge(s)

...instead of one more check one all four corner of the pushblocks

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/14/2021 01:26

I'll look into that
(replying to @ Bagu "Maybe it can be an attribute…"): "push blocks will sink" already exists; it's the "block hole" flag

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 05:29

Yeah, but I thought of instant Liquid Block Hole (like mentioned in my earlier post)

https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/920108592349216828/920108607440318474

And Having an extra BlockHole->Next Flag under each Water Combo, is same kind of flag waste as having a NoPushblocks flag under each Water Combo.

An engine Block->Liquid replacement would be much better, so there would be no need for each pushblock to have a "->Next" Combo following.

...and a Block that sinks in a Left-Edge WaterCombo would need another "->Next" combo, than one that sinks in Right-Edge Water Combos.
...Anyting else causes odd graphics.
...but exactly this is the Problem, cause "There can be only ONE" ->Next combo 🙂

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 05:51

I think, Pushblocks (if "sinkable") should turn into that watercombo, that they were pushed onto (and create a "Drown" Animation ...as sprites who can drown when they collide with liquids.)

=== @ vlamart 12/14/2021 19:27

It would be interesting to have the opposite idea for pits. Like pushing a block over a pit to use its undercombo to make a bridge over the pit

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 20:21

That's definitly intressting, @ vlamart 

Thanks for mentioning, cause I tried and just noticed that Pits offer exactly that Pushblock interaction, that I would wish for liquid.

=== @ Bagu 12/14/2021 20:25

The Puhblock disappears, the combo creates a "Fall" sprite (drown in case of liquids) and evrything else stays as it is (without any ->Next combos)
