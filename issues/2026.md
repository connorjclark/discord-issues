Using the fill function with flags on any layer above 0 causes ZQ to crash

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) sounds like probably you, undo/redo stuff?
didn't you fix something like this already?

Can we assume this is a recent build

=== @ Deathrider 11/13/2022 04:52

My guess is
you fixed it for floodfilling combos
but not floodfilling *flags*
as those are separate functions
probably just need to apply the same fix to the other function

....ah I see what happened here
yeah, just needs the same fix

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 10:18

fixed
