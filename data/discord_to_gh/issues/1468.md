They do not spawn after triggering the combo. I can give a test file if that is necessary

What do you mean "Decoration" here?
Is this specifically something tied to the combo type "Generic Combo" ?

=== @ Twilight Knight 03/16/2022 14:59

The clippings, the flag has been renamed to "Decorations"
And I'm not certain about it being only for the generic combo yet

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 03/16/2022 15:14

For tall grasses, flower combos, and shallow water and such.

=== @ Twilight Knight 03/16/2022 15:24

The clippings do work for tall grass

I see what's wrong
an `else` was attached to the wrong `if`

=== @ Twilight Knight 03/16/2022 15:29

Shit happens
Thanks for fixing it 😄

Funnily enough, right now, UNchecking `Decoration Sprite` would make it display....
Also, `Clippings` != `Decoration`
Clippings refers to using the hardcoded slash sprites like bushes/flowers normally use
decoration uses any misc sprite
...but you need to have decoration checked to check clippings
naming conventions were... uh... not followed before, so things were renamed to fix things.
because, you know, Zoria not the best at the whole dev work thing

Hmmz
Could be worth it as I want to release my demo with a104 (I'm busy testing it now)
But on the other hand it wouldn't work for future builds, so I think I'll stick with it

And I named it clippings just to make it clear to Cakes

=== @ Twilight Knight 03/16/2022 15:33

I think `decoration` is a good name for it

Should I test it with the version you sent?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2022 15:35

aye, should fix it

=== @ Twilight Knight 03/16/2022 15:36

It indeed does, thanks 👌

Out of curiosity, traced back the bug.... and it be mine.
That brace needed to be 2 lines lower, and the indenting was wrong

=== @ Twilight Knight 03/16/2022 15:39

Ouch, it happens to the best of us

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/16/2022 15:39

or rather, that else needed to be on the new brace
