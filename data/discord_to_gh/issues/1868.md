A person more graphically inclined was watching some of my streams and videos, and said the subscreen was being choppy and slowing down the framerate.  I don't know how universal it is, but here's the test data:

Quest: James Quest: Sidestory
Room: Metal King Slime room, Birthday Slime room
Nightly: Latest
If you want the quest or videos, let me know

. . . if it's in a video, it could be anything from your recording software to anything else?
so, uh, I definitely would not count that as a ZC bug report in the slightest? @ DeletedUser

I'll check framerate when I get home and advise
You're right, could be other things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/16/2022 23:45

could be a video card, your rendering settings, etc
there are thousands of things it could be
that have absolutely nothing to do with zc at all
so

Fair

they or you also could have a bad internet connection
as long as YOUR framerate while playing says 60 the video framerate doesn't matter to players
