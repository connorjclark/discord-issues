An enemy set to chase the player with MoveAtAngle() gets stopped by a wall above, even though Ghost_MoveAtAngle() will slide along the wall.

```
bool SeekerMoleChase(npc mole, int ignore_solid)
    {
        int angle = Angle(mole->X + (8 * mole->TileWidth), mole->Y + (8 * mole->TileHeight), Player->X + 8, Player->Y + 8);
        return mole->MoveAtAngle(angle, (mole->Step / 100), ignore_solid);
    }
```
Movement function with the angle.

```
Ghost_MoveAtAngle(Angle(Ghost_X, Ghost_Y, Link->X, Link->Y), 1, 0);
            Screen->Rectangle(6, Ghost_X, Ghost_Y, Ghost_X + ghost->HitWidth, Ghost_Y + ghost->HitHeight, 0x06, 1, 0, 0, 0, false, OP_OPAQUE);
            Ghost_Waitframe(this, ghost, true, true);
```
Similar script with Ghost that does slide along the north wall.

Same NPC script movement function as above, but it is very permanently stuck in that corner.

quest files for easy testing of both behaviors would be good

Had to recreate a bunch of things. Test room is one south of start, the other rooms are full of enemies that already circumvented the issue with my own functions.
Scripts in buffer.
