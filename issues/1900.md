A few very useful elaborations for the "Shooter" type of Combo that will really get people going.

Copy-Pasteable text from the above:

--------

The Combo fires every X frames. (0 = Don't fire.)
Ex: 1 Second = 60 Frames.

--------

The LWeapon or EWeapon ID to be shot:
This is found in "std_constants.zh" which can be found in the "\include\std_zh\" subfolder.
Scroll down to "//EWeapon types" 
I.e. an enemy arrow is 130.

Must have the "No L/R Inventory Shifting" quest rule enabled for this to work.
Find it in "Quest Options" -> "Misc" Tab, second pane.
