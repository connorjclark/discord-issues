I set all 4 of my Game Icons all to Mermaid sprites, but for some reason Link is showing in there instead.
This is in latest Alpha 2.55

Did you make a new save after updating them?

=== @ Moosh 10/05/2021 01:28

I believe if you change game icons but don't make a new save it'll continue to use the old set. Think they're tied to the save data and not the quest

This happened after i got the blue ring.

try setting `reload_game_icons = 1` in `zc.cfg`

@ SkyLizardGirl test again in A99, and try with `reload_game_icons = 1` in zc.cfg
