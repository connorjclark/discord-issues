- ~~While modifying a palette with F4 un-voids a screen, `Paste Palette` does not do so.~~ Fixed
- ~~Due to scroll-to-preview F4 menu change, blue void screens become unvoided by selecting a palette, even if you cancel~~ Fixed
- Tool needed to forcibly blue-void any screens of all combo 0 cset 0 palette 0, for cleanup of empty screens.
- ~~Autolayer dialog needs checkbox for whether or not to un-void screens on the map~~ EDIT: Replacing this. Instead:
 - ~~Save the autolayer for each map, use it on load for blue void screen defaults. (autolayer then does NOT need to un-void anything)~~ Added/fixed.

Ooh! That last one sounds super useful

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2023 14:38

For point 3, let's make it fancy:
- Checkboxes for different ways to filter what screens to delete
 - `All Combo 0`
 - `All CSet 0`
 - `All Flag 0`
 - `Palette 0`
 - `Has No Layers`
 - `Is Not Used As Layer`
(any suggestions for filter additions you have are welcome)

=== @ Phosphor 07/06/2023 14:39

Maybe add combo flags
Though I guess "is not used as layer" might cover that use case

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/06/2023 14:40

true, but options don't hurt
adding new options later is harder than just having them there to begin with

=== @ Phosphor 07/06/2023 14:41

Has no FFCs
Has no room data

=== @ Phosphor 07/06/2023 14:43

Has no side warps
I can't really think of anything other than those a blank screen might inexplicably have present, because making combo 0 a tile warp would be stupid

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 13:21

```Tool needed to forcibly blue-void any screens of all combo 0 cset 0 palette 0, for cleanup of empty screens.``` if a screen is blue-voided, it shouldn't lose it's layer
it's super annoying when you accidentally create a screen, want to blue-void it cause you don't have any plans for the screen yet, but the only way to do so is deleting the screen which removes any auto-layers from the screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 18:37

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "it's super annoying when you…"): the point is blue-voided screens are *blank*, they should have *no data*

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 18:39

right, but if I autolayer a map, I want it to remember the layers I autolayered for the map

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 18:40

yeah, thus that should un-blue-void the screens to indicate they have data (layers)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 18:40

ew
I don't want to unvoid the whole map

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 18:40

thus why the suggested fix indicates it being togglable

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 18:41

idea: save the autolayered screens to the map
er, autolayered maps

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 18:41

. . . that does make a lot of sense
note that that means deleting a screen and reloading will load the autolayers again
as *all* blue void screens would use that layer

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 18:44

I think that's acceptable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 18:44

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "- ~~While modifying a palette…"): ^modified

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 18:45

the question then would be; how would you change or clear an autolayer on the map?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 18:45

by err doing an autolayer again

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 18:46

okay, makes sense

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 18:47

it'd be cool to have a layer dialogue for the map similar to the layer dialogue that lets you view or change the autolayer for the map (as well as maybe set layer 2/3 is background and layer transparency?) with the current autolayer method also working, but that's slightly more effort

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 18:56

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "it'd be cool to have a layer…"): if you wanna add that once i add this feel free!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 18:56

alright

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 19:51

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "I don't want to unvoid the wh…"): . . . by the way, it does unvoid the entire *layer* map

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 19:51

yeah, that's fine
or well, I never had a problem with that
that's part of why I have a problem with it unvoiding the base map actually; I assume maps that are just all palette 0  and created are layer maps

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 19:58

....I could make unused layer screens not be un-blue-voided
they get un-blue-voided when you place anything on them to actually use them
so there's no reason to un-blue-void everything on setting layers
does that sound better?
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 20:01

yeah that's probably better
(as long as it still shows the "used as layer by" tooltip at the bottom)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 20:01

was just typing to say that it does yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 21:13

ahk, autolayer fixes applied. (When you autolayer, it remembers the autolayer you applied, and re-applies that on loading the quest to all blue void screens. Autolayer / setting layers no longer un-blue-voids anything at all.)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 21:28

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "- ~~While modifying a palette…"): ...I don't know if we need a tool like that anymore, now that autolayer doesn't un-void anything tbh.
so, this might be all closed up.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 21:30

@ Phosphor @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) @ Moosh should be good to go in next build

=== @ Phosphor 07/15/2023 21:30

The full tool set?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 21:31

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "For point 3, let's make it fa…"): I didn't make an auto-eraser tool
but, autolayer no longer un-voids screens
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "ahk, autolayer fixes applied.…"): ^
so, it probably won't be needed?
