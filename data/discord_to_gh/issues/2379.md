I guess we can make this official now:  Nintendo has officially done away with the "8/9/10 level rule" with TotK.  Is there any way we can adjust Zelda Classic (even if it's in a long future version) to have more than 8/9 levels by making the Triforce a legacy quest rule (like 3-6 Triforce Pieces).  It'd allow more flexibility in quest creation, especially for those that like longer quests.

=== @ Russ 05/20/2023 20:37

I mean... this hardly seems necessary in that the majority of quests out there don't even use triforce pieces anyways. Triforce pieces are themselves more or less a legacy thing

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 20:40

(replying to @ Russ "I mean... this hardly seems n…"): They can be made into "other items" and still used for level control

=== @ Russ 05/20/2023 20:48

I'm not sure I understand what you're saying

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 20:50

The "Triforce" doesn't necessary need to be the Triforce
It can be made into other items
That you can collect

=== @ Russ 05/20/2023 20:50

Okay. But... what about this requires a quest rule?

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 20:51

Oh, that would eliminate the need for the collecting the items in the quest if the author deems it

=== @ Russ 05/20/2023 20:51

There's no need for that anyways
Just... don't use a level 9 entrance room
This is something quests have been doing for nearly 2 decades

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 20:52

And how do you eliminate it from the subscreen altogether if you're not using it (if it's not scripted?)

=== @ Russ 05/20/2023 20:52

You just... don't put a triforce frame on the subscreen
That's a been a thing you could do since very early 2.50 alphas

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 20:53

I'm not sure if that'd break functionality or cause jank, I'm sure there's workarounds

=== @ Russ 05/20/2023 20:53

I can assure it breaks no functionality and causes no jank
Speaking as someone who has not had a triforce frame on the subscreen in any of his quests
And as someone who has played many quests that do the same

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 20:54

I've had difficulty creating two sets of level-defeating collection items without using scripts

=== @ Russ 05/20/2023 20:55

I could see the utility of modifying the level 9 entrance room to be a generic "Open if player has X amount of Y item" room. Or adding a combo that's triggered by holding a certain amount of a certain item
Although I think string control codes can do that?

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 20:56

Let's take this scenario
This was a proposed one from ZxDS
For the 1st Quest section you got Triforce Pieces (8)
For the 2nd Quest section you collected the Dark Souls (8)
Triforce room took care of the first one
But how do you take care of the second one without scripts?

=== @ Russ 05/20/2023 20:57

String control codes
```\6\X\X\X - Goto If Counter. If a counter is at or above a certain value, then ZC switches to another string. Argument 1 is the counter, argument 2 is the value, and argument 3 is the string to switch to. ```
Set argument 1 to your souls counter, argument 2 to 8, and argument 3 to the id of a string with a control code that triggers secrets, or gives you a key, or whatever you need it to do.

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 20:58

Well, figure for the way I had it written, I had Triforce Pieces 1-8 be the Triforce, and 9-16 be the Dark Souls
8 opens the Lv. 9 room as you know
And 16 should've triggered a battle
Later on
I'll just leave it as food for thought

=== @ NightmareJames 05/20/2023 21:05

(and for the record anybody thinking LttP quests and upgrades might take interest with pendants and crystals)

=== @ Russ 05/20/2023 21:06

I guess I'm still not sure what the feature request you're making actually is. All the scenarios you're describing can already be done without any scripting and without any new quest rule

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 02:17

yeah, there's not really a request here
if you just want to be able to trigger something based on counters or items.... either SCCs or combo triggers can handle that entirely
what quest rule are you even requesting?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 16:50

uhhh
quests have had more than 9 levels for a *long* time

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 16:53

without scripts

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 16:57

have you played Isle of Rebirth? To the top (a 2.10 quest for the record)? Any of HeroOfFire's randomizers?

=== @ Russ 05/22/2023 17:00

IoR is actually a somewhat decent example since it uses triforces for level 1-8, but doesn't use a level 9 check, and then has a different set of mcguffins for 10-12. All accomplished with screen state carryovers

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:01

granted, quests where you can do any dungeon in any order that have more than 8 dungeons are pretty rare and I'm not sure there's any that don't use scripting to make it fancier, but I don't think it's that hard to do so besides the fact that making more than 8 dungeons can be exhausting
(replying to @ Russ "IoR is actually a somewhat de…"): it actually does have a triforce check on the offchance you skip one of the triforces; I'm not actually sure it's possible to skip any though

=== @ Russ 05/22/2023 17:02

Oh it does? Huh...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:02

yeah, the screen before the entrance to level 9 is a triforce check IIRC

=== @ Russ 05/22/2023 17:02

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "granted, quests where you can…"): Okay so weird example but
Lost Isle's triforce dungeons
They don't actually utilize a level 9 check room, since there's only 6 of them
Just a corridor of rooms that are locked if you haven't completed the corresponding dungeon

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:03

wait really?
even though you can have a triforce check with less depending on QRs?

=== @ Russ 05/22/2023 17:03

Yeah
You could actually do a room to check for non-linear progression fairly easily
First dungeon has a SSC that changes the first row of floor tiles in the room to direct warps to an identical screen
Second the second row, and so on
If at any point you haven't cleared the dungeon, the SSC hasn't kicked in, and instead you're warped to a room that says "You haven't cleared X dungeon"
Doable with no scripts, no string control codes
Just some 2.10-style silliness with a few 2.50 sensibilities

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:06

for the record these two rules exist; one makes it so that picking up a triforce gives you a second triforce for free, and the other reduces the triforce check to 6 (which, if you have the other rule on, means you only need to collect 3 to beat the level 9 room)

=== @ Russ 05/22/2023 17:06

Right. I recall back in 2.10 being told that 3, 4, 6, and 8 were the supported number
And anything different would require fancier tricks

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:07

fancier tricks could just be starting you off with triforces in init data
(which you can also do)

=== @ Russ 05/22/2023 17:07

Could you back in 2.10 though? :P

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:07

no clue!
too lazy to check
but generic combos make it even easier

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:11

check this

this
and set these

place the combo on the screen somewhere, and presto! a secret triggers if you have 15 or more of counter Custom 15 (or whatever you have it named)

=== @ Russ 05/22/2023 17:14

Oh dang, that is convenient
New combo editor is kind of the catch all for misc non-scripted effects now, huh?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:14

yeah, it's kinda bonkers
you can have it do crazy stuff like trigger a global timer, or have it spawn an enemy and *then* trigger once that enemy dies, etc

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:17

finally you'd just have each triforce item be it's own item that you display separately on the subscreen with item override, that increases the counter it's checking by 1 when picked up
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109578117384781874/1110255176444555264/image.png?ex=65e60235&is=65d38d35&hm=d32ff09472714d9ab29a88e8cee30d540f27ce2d5e014cd00e74d86ec2b0c9e7&)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:18

you could then also check for each item manually with generic combos if, say, you want to check for a specific triforce ("The triforce in the dungeon north of here is causing the area to flood!" "yay! it's no longer flooded!")

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:23

it probably wouldn't be hard to make an in-engine custom triforce count check; just I'm worried you're capping yourself creatively. ZC has been able to do stuff of this level for over a decade even without scripting, it's quite versatile
(replying to @ Russ "Okay so weird example but"): okay even weirder example: Link's Quest for the Hookshot

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:25

the first 8 dungeons you just get 100 rupees cause they're the only source of money in the game to buy the 800 rupee hookshot, which blocks off level 9

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:27

the triforces are reserved entirely for the 7 dark world dungeons plus one freebie in warp zone, none of which are needed to actually enter the final dungeon; in fact, entering the final dungeon is just a switch in a different dark world dungeon that isn't one of the triforce ones. The triforce check is only at the final boss to check for your ending path

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 17:28

(replying to @ Russ "New combo editor is kind of t…"): Exactly.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/22/2023 17:28

also @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) can you check level items (compass, map, etc) with combos?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/22/2023 17:28

no
err, hmm.... how is it checking item ownership?
no, yeah, it's checking normal ownership, so no is correct
So @ Russ , there's a lot of fancy

Triggering secrets, resetting the combo's animation, killing all enemies on screen
CLEARING enemies/lweapons/eweapons from the screen (Ex: kill boss, triggers the combo, clears all weapons on screen so you don't die to a shot after the boss is dead)
change the combo/cset
Killing the weapon that triggered the combo, and lighting it on fire so it can trigger fire triggers (ex arrow through torches)
`ComboType Trigger->` is yet to be implemented
`->ComboType Effects` for combotype-specific results (cutting a bush, opening the save menu at a save point, etc)
`Only Gen Triggers` REMOVES the combo's normal triggers (i.e. bushes no longer get slashed)
`Weapon Separate Triggers` means that if a weapon triggers the combo, ONLY the effects inside the `Weapon` frame there trigger, not anything else
SFX to play on triggering
`RunFrozen` to run a generic script (something like a popup menu) in the frozen mode (same as `genericdata->RunFrozen()`)
