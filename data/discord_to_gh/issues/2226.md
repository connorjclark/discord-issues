Latest nightly, March 8. When trying to reference an LWeapon pointer from an enemy hit event, the pointer value is off by 1.
```generic script OnTouchEvents {
    void run() {
        this->EventListen[GENSCR_EVENT_HERO_HIT_1] = true;
        this->EventListen[GENSCR_EVENT_ENEMY_HIT1] = true;
        int eventType;
        while(true) {
            eventType = WaitEvent();
            //PLAYER HIT
                if (eventType == GENSCR_EVENT_HERO_HIT_1) {
                    //NPC HITTING PLAYER
                    if (Game->EventData[GENEV_HEROHIT_HITTYPE] == OBJTYPE_NPC) {
                        npc hitNPC = Game->EventData[GENEV_HEROHIT_HITOBJ];
                        //Electrocution
                        if (hitNPC->Attributes[EK[EK_TOUCHEFF_ATTR]] & EK_OT_ELECTROSWORD) {
                            STATUS[STA_ELECTROCUTED] = Game->Generic[GEN_ENEM_DMG_MULT]*hitNPC->Damage;
                            Game->EventData[GENEV_HEROHIT_NULLIFY] = true;
                        }
                    }
                }
            //ENEMY HIT
                if (eventType == GENSCR_EVENT_ENEMY_HIT1) {
                    npc hitNPC = Game->EventData[GENEV_EHIT_NPCPTR];
                    lweapon hitLWpn = Game->EventData[GENEV_EHIT_LWPNPTR];
                    if (hitLWpn->ID == LW_SWORD) {
                        STATUS[STA_ELECTROCUTED] = Game->Generic[GEN_ENEM_DMG_MULT]*hitNPC->Damage;
                        Game->EventData[GENEV_EHIT_NULLIFY] = true;
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}```
script, for reference.  The Enemy Hit section at the bottom is creating an lweapon pointer, `hitLWpn`, and then trying to reference its `ID`

ZScript debugger prints this whenever an enemy is hit

actually - I'm sorry - this only happens when the weapon is an `LW_SWORD`?
I just tried it with a scripted LWeapon and the script is picking up the weapon pointer fine

=== @ mitchfork 03/10/2023 00:18

here's a funny one that solves this (except when it doesn't)
```untyped makeTheDamnNumberRight = Game->EventData[GENEV_EHIT_LWPNPTR]-1L;
lweapon hitLWpn = makeTheDamnNumberRight;```

err, doing anything scripted involving melee weapons is janky as fuck
Keep in mind that if the sword weapon "dies", the engine will immediately create a brand new one the next frame
melee shit is jank AF, and this is why scripts can't create them

=== @ mitchfork 03/10/2023 00:59

But I would figure that at least in this generic script timing, the pointer would be right? It's catching it the instant in timing where the enemy is hit

It's because in this case, it's creating a fake weapon to hit the enemy right as it hits it, which is not added to the sprite list of weapons.
Fun!

aaah, I see the workaround Zoria did here for `HitBy`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/15/2023 12:27

bwahaha, magic has been worked

=== @ mitchfork 03/15/2023 13:08

Awesome!
Also... Frightening

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/15/2023 13:09

New nightly on the way
For melee weapons, it should give the pointer to the REAL weapon, not the fake it creates to temporarily hit the enemy
For anything else fake, it should add the fake weapon pointer to the weapon array for the duration of the event, allowing it to be accessed. From what I can tell, this is used by Stomp Boots and nothing else.

I tested with melee weapons by changing the CSet of the sword, and it indeed stayed changed for the rest of the swing
