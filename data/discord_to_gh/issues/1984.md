Got inspired by someone saying they had trouble making underwater NPCs. With this QR on, the layer that textboxes render to will not be affected by waving effects - screen or scripted. Another nice rule for scripted use might be an anti-textbox-quaking rule (i.e. when someone is shouting about the earthquake and you want to be able to read it lol)

Not really possible
Remember that layers are not an actual thing, they are just the *draw order*.
The wave effect is applied to the *screen*.
As in, after every single draw is DONE, the wave effect is applied
so this would require massive rewrites
