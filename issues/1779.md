Currently, config files are included with each new alpha or nightly, and you have to specifically not include it if you don't want to have to rebind your controls or reset certain settings (such as the level palette fix). Instead of including it, maybe it could be generated when you load up ZQuest or ZC and a config isn't already found.

Frankly, they should be generated if you don't have the file with how things work now
so @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) just remove the .cfg from the `output/package`
and it *should* work

`zc_get_config` writes the default val to the config if that's what it receives from allegro
so any config read with that will appear in a generated config file

I've been meaning to ask, what is the intended way to copy config settings? One of my biggest reservations about getting a new build is the slog of "oh, I gotta set up my controls, and paths again üò©"
I'd rather just copy the config file from an older build, if that was an option, but up until now, I've done is manually each time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2022 01:02

you can just copy from the previous build
though generally we've had to give the disclaimer that if you're having issues, try using the default config and re-setting up your configs

=== @ Anthus 07/27/2022 01:03

mm
makes sense, if stuff changes etc

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2022 01:03

but for a while now, (since the code changes shown above, about a year? ago) it should update the existing config
the only thing you won't get updated is if the default setting changes

=== @ Anthus 07/27/2022 01:04

yeah, I don't mind doing that tbh
I just... never really thought about it much. I mean, I've copied .sav files, but it never really occurred to me to copy the config file

=== @ Anthus 07/27/2022 01:06

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "but for a while now, (since t‚Ä¶"): fwiw, I've had to re-config every time I've downloaded a new ZC version (for years, and years), even if I put it in the same folder (which I don't do anymore, every new alpha has its own folder now)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2022 01:09

Yeah, the problem is the one deedee reported here
the new download contains default `.cfg`s
so you need to specifically not overwrite yours with those

=== @ Anthus 07/27/2022 01:10

ahhh
thanks, I think I get it. I tend to overcomplicate things lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2022 07:08

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) so, this isn't set up completely
What you would need to do (and notably, I am not doing it)
is replace every `get_config_int`, `get_config_string`, `get_config_float` with `zc_get_config`
(the params don't change, only the function name)
that'll make sure that when it tries to read the config, it writes it back to the file if needed
thus generating the file
Once you've done that, you can remove the configs from `output/config`
