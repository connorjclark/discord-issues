While doing some tileset organization I moved a bunch of pages around, but the ones containing subscreen elements did not update to the new locations. Combos and items handled the move just fine. Additional testing indicates enemy tiles and string backgrounds do not update either.

Enemy tiles absolutely should update
String backgrounds and subscreen elements do not appear to be handled (never were)
but enemy tiles are handled
and the code for it is fucking cursed

=== @ Moosh 05/12/2023 00:01

Yeah I can understand those being unreasonable...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/12/2023 00:01

Do note that the `W:` and `H:` fields under the tile in the enemy editor are how it knows what tiles belong to the enemy

=== @ Moosh 05/12/2023 00:02

(just like moving 56 heart minitiles for Firebird by hand was unreasonable aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/12/2023 00:02

it should even warn you if you try to move part of an enemy's tiles but not all of them
(the system for this shit is complex af)

=== @ Moosh 05/12/2023 00:03

It does have a warning, just doesn't update the original tile in the editor to the new position. And yeah, I can imagine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/12/2023 00:03

(replying to @ Moosh "It does have a warning, just…"): If it warns you because you are moving part of an enemy, that means it won't be able to update

=== @ Moosh 05/12/2023 00:03

I'm kinda impressed move updates combo, item, and sprite tiles at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/12/2023 00:03

it should update if you move an enemy's entire set of tiles, though

=== @ Moosh 05/12/2023 00:04

Yeah, that it's not doing
Lemme check if I move just the o. tile

=== @ Moosh 05/12/2023 00:05

Moved aquamentus's head up two tiles, o. tile is using the space where it use to be

=== @ Moosh 05/12/2023 00:06

Anyways, I figure this one's thoroughly low priority. Just wanted to make note of it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/12/2023 00:07

So, that behavior is expected
for just copying the o. tile
It may not work right for the aquamentus because it's tiles there are across a page boundary
but, it *definitely works*, I just tested it on Octoroks
as long as I select the entire 16x3 area the octorok uses for the copy, moving it does update properly.

=== @ Moosh 05/12/2023 00:45

I see. So the problem is specifically enemies that cross pages and if I were to change the W and H fields in the editor to 1 it should work then? That's weird but I get it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/12/2023 00:47

I would assume then that combos that cross pages would likely have the same issue?
maybe not but quite likely?
