Okay. so...I have no idea what's causing this, the areas where it happens are inconsistent between quests, but are consistent in where they happen. At first I thought it was a gollab bug since the screen scrolling was tied to a scripted warp pad so i just thought that it was just not applicable to 2.55.
But apparently some quests if the screen scrolls in specific areas, ZC crashes. They don't even need to be scripted quests.
And I know that it's not just a backwards compatibility bug because it also happens in my project as well.

2.53? 2.55? Both?
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?
Is smart scrolling enabled in the quest? Is Smarter Smart Scrolling enabled, if in 2.55?

=== @ Guinevere 08/28/2021 04:32

2.55

=== @ P-Tux7 08/28/2021 04:34

what's smarter screen scrolling

=== @ Guinevere 08/28/2021 04:35

umm idk about the other quests
but "fixed smart scrolling" is disabled in my quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/28/2021 04:35

k, so isn't that
given @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)'s work with scrolling shit, feel like she is probably more qualified to look at this

=== @ Guinevere 08/28/2021 04:36

i'm removing my zc.sav to see if it's just a save corruption

=== @ Guinevere 08/28/2021 04:39

nope it's not just a save corruption

=== @ Mitsukara 08/28/2021 05:42

I totally forgot to report it, but I know that in 2.50.2 or 2.53 I was trying some random quest off the database that had no scripts, but used the Smart Scrolling feature, and trying to scroll onto a solid combo while swimming crashed ZC I think
so that may be relaetd

=== @ Guinevere 08/28/2021 05:47

i see.

Forget everything i just said, for it's foobar, i have no idea what's causing zc to crash when the player scrolls
<:nekobleh:749523485373497375>
*wait*
AHAH!

=== @ Guinevere 08/28/2021 16:59

when fixed screen scrolling is enabled;
if there are solid combos at one edge of the screen,  and nothing on the opposite edge, it blocks link from scrolling that way where the solid combos would be like if they were on the next screen in the same position.

Wtf

ye idk either

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/28/2021 17:08

(replying to @ Mitsukara "I totally forgot to report it‚Ä¶"): Oh goddamnit i know what that is
I saw a weird check where swimming seemed to ignire dmart scrolling
Dmart scrolling. Where you scroll to a d mart

=== @ Guinevere 08/28/2021 19:00

Idk if this is the thing causing zc to crash in some quests when you scroll in specific areas, but the possibility is there.

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 03:19

Here's also an example of a quest crashing when trying to scroll the screen. To my knowledge First Quest Layered (the quest being played) isn't scripted at all.

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 04:06

idk why but sometimes it takes a couple times to scroll, but other times it only takes one attempt to crash

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 04:09

does it consistently do it on a specific transition?
if so, could you send a copy of the quest where you spawn in the room in question?
(Crashes are easier to debug than less serious bugs, because if I run it in the debugger, it will literally tell me what line of code crashed)
(but, need to do that in a debug build, attached to the dev chain, so gotta do it myself

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 04:13

uhh, how do i set a spawn in someone else's quest?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 04:13

oh is it passworded?

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 04:13

ye

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 04:13

just send it then
I can bypass passwords

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 04:14

oh okie

love when the actual crash line it gives me is inside a C++ class, so it doesn't tell me where the call is that crashed....
but, at least I recreated it
so I can debug from there

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 04:56

i see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 05:12

It's not the scrolling code
the scrolling code isn't even fucking running
it's crashing before it gets there

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 05:12

i see
that makes sense
since you don't even see the screen scroll once it crashes
but surprised that the code has nothing to do with it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 05:19

....it's fucking related to SWITCH BLOCKS
WHAT THE FUCK

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 05:19

>.>
wut?

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 05:21

I don't even wanna ask *how* that works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 05:22

Some of the switchblock code
is referencing something out of bounds
because of the X/Y position of Link being offscreen

=== @ Guinevere 08/31/2021 05:22

uh huh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 05:26

fixed

You are a life saver
way to go

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/31/2021 20:01

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....it's fucking related to S‚Ä¶"): Is it the exact same crash that you fixed for me the other day?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 21:01

?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/31/2021 23:07

you know, the bomb wall switch block crash
I don't think that fix ever got pushed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 23:12

I don't recall that
but that sounds like this
and it wasn't that a fix didn't get pushed
it wasn't fixed
until now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/31/2021 23:14

No, I mean you sent me code that fixed it
But I haven't pushed anything since I started sideview swimming

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/31/2021 23:16

oh, I did?
well, merge conflict on your end probably then

=== @ Guinevere 09/01/2021 02:32

(replying to @ Guinevere "when fixed screen scrolling i‚Ä¶"): There's still this bug with the fixed smart scrolling, should I make a seperate thread for this or just keep it here?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/01/2021 02:37

separate thread

=== @ Guinevere 09/01/2021 02:38

Okie
