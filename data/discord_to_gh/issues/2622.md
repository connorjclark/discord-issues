When configuring the room type, the Shop/Unused text is centered. If you select room type shop and then press OK or click "set" on the bottom right for Guy ID, the "Shop:" label gets shifted to the right. After this, you may also change the room type back to "(None)" and the "(Unused)" text is inside the text box.
