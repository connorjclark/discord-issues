Some stuff I wanna do here.

The bisect script works on GitHub releases and downloads from GitHub. It also knows how to get binaries from workflow runs on main, but those expire after 90 days. There's also far more commits between releases before we started doing nightly, which sucks because older commits are tougher to build locally, so a run of the current bisect script can likely result in ~100+ commit range that requires you to do more painful local build bisects.

Related, it'd be nice for backup purposes to upload all release binaries to a second place. Can place this in a cloud storage bucket.

* Make a script to upload new releases to cloud storage. Run this in CI in release job. Backfill for all current releases
* Grab binaries from main workflow runs and add to cloud storage for backup, so they won't expire. Call these "unofficial builds"
* Build a bunch of commits between the largest release gaps and upload to cloud storage (don't create releases for these unofficial builds)
* * Alt: maybe just automate building of these old commits and drive it w/ bisect script when needed? Or mix of both? Depends on how much space      making a unofficial build for every commit would take...
* Modify bisect script to grab binaries from cloud storage, instead of GitHub

Almost done with adding local building of any commit to bisect_builds.py. Only requires you to install VS 2019 (easy enough, the VS installer/launcher lets you have more than one version)

I've got every ~20th commit since the introduction of CMakeLists.txt working now. Once I work out how to build things before that, I'll put all the builds in cloud storage and make the bisect script download from that directly.
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I couldn't figure out how to build before cmake. The makefile seems weird. Do you remember it ever working? Before commit `03c4a915cda8d0bd00ec95b401eb95fa1ce8fc8a`

It's only like the first 100 commits so not too important.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I could…"): before cmake is before me being here sooo

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/30/2024 00:47

Oh, so  day 1 you added the cmake file?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/30/2024 00:47

cmake was already in use when I joined
in Sept 2018
anything prior to then I have 0 idea

For some reason my brain did not read this, saw "E" and assumed Emily

this has every release we've done, plus all the test build commits I made
bisect script now uses this
next I need to automate pushing builds to this
