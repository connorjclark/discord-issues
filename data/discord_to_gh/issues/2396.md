what it says on the tin. having a sound effect for opening/closing the subscreen as a base feature would be cool.

Really like this suggestion.

surprisingly not!

Yeah, Zelda 1 didn't have a sound for this.
Started doing it with the second game.

I seem to remember BS Zelda having a sound for its subscreen, but I think I may be misremembering...

*\*checks\** Yup, it does.
