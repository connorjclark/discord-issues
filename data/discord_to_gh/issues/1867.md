These are QRs that affect whether or not being Item Jinxed means that you lose access to your Glove items or your Active Shield items.

Also, as for Gloves in particular, Link has to always have Level 1 gloves in Init Data to even pick up bushes, another quest rule where he gets to keep Level 1 gloves but not higher tiers might be nice too. Because the bushes aren't supposed to count as him having equipment on in LTTP/LA, just his bare hands. Though I guess the same argument can be made for Sword Jinxes so IDK, the first rule is definitely more important than this one.

I forgot that these two items can be assigned to non-interchangeable buttons, so yeah, would make sense to have them be an option to "count" as active items for the purpose of jinxes or not

Oh, I'm adding a jinx immunity checkbox for *all items*
That question was related to a specific part of it
