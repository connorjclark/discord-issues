This one is a bit farfetched and complicated, but i just want to put it out there: A setting that makes items out of a specific layer. While matching that layer, the combo brush becomes an item brush, and you can place items down like you would tiles. I imagine this is scriptable somehow, but doing it via script would complicate the process of previewing it. I imagine this will get turned down quickly, but i thought it a neat idea anyway. also, with careful planning it MIGHT be able to be done with scripts too.

more than one item per screen is something I want, but something that isn't likely feasible
Any additions to screendata is an exponential increase, cause max maps is 256
