Was trying to explain the packages feature to somebody and it appears it's hanging on the file select screen when I create a quest. Pressing enter stops the hang (as if there's an invisible dialog?) and then it displays this error when I try to load it

There's this black space covering part of the screen when it hangs (presumably a dialog?)

It becomes visible when I try to close the program but is obscured by the quit dialog
