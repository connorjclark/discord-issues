Some issues with creating packages. @ Deathrider went to create a package, and was met with this for zc_args:```
-only c:\Users\Evan\Desktop\Terror of Necromancy\ToN Main Quest\Quest+Music\ToNDemo5.qst -window-title Terror of Necromancy```
1. This uses an absolute path, which won't work when distributed
2. The path is not enclosed in quotes, which breaks it entirely due to the path containing spaces
3. The window title also is multiple words, assuming that also needs to be enquoted?

I think an absolute path works incidentally due to how the quest loading bends over backwards when trying to find a file of the requested name (but should fix this anyhow)

yeah, spaces break all the things here, good catch
