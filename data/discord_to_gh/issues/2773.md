When using `Cheat->Player Data` to cheat in items, if you go back into `Cheat->Player Data` without having *unpaused*, your changes will be gone, as the init data delta has yet to be applied @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

(still doing work in the serialization functions atm tho, think I should have multi-dimensional array output working... doing some good optimizations for init data stuff)

I'm not seeing this.

Is this only with your local changes?
Ahhh, gone from the dialog, but it still applies when unpaused.
Hmm.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Ahhh, gone from the dialog, b…"): yeah, exactly
thought it was local at first until unpausing and reopening the dialog applied the changes

Fixed, will merge soon.
