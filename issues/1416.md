Currently the search feature in lists works by string comparison. This is handy provided one knows the names of things in the list and the list is actually sorted alphabetically. At some point the combo flag list changed from numerical listing to alphabetical. Handy for new users maybe, but I know a lot of these flags by their numbers first. And there's a somewhat different issue with the item, enemy, and sprite lists where sometimes I'll forget what I named something, but know the ID

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:05

So what would be real nice would be if a search starting with 0-9 assumed I'm searching by ID and everytging else used string comparison

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2022 22:06

Hmm
That should be easy enough

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:07

Excellent. :D

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2022 22:08

Everything from me is paused until the new string GUI is done, so might be a week or so until I get around to it

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:08

Of course, take your time
Thanks for all the work you've been putting into new features, optimizations,  and QoL stuff

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:11

Also wonder if the inverse of this request might also be possible. If the leading character in the search is a letter, ignore leading IDs. Would allow searching some lists like palettes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2022 22:12

Harder
And only works if the list is alphabetized
If it's in numerical order then you'd need to type a lot before it gets you close to the right match
That's why flags were changed

=== @ Moosh 02/21/2022 22:12

Dang. Well at least that one comes up a lot less

=== @ P-Tux7 02/22/2022 01:42

Whoa... the combo flag list is alphabetized? I didn't recall so last I checked a month or two ago

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/22/2022 01:42

Is it not?
If so it should be

=== @ Moosh 02/22/2022 01:47

Oh it might still be ordered by ID
yeah it is
But it no longer lists the number first, so I can't just type 16 and immediately hop to secret flags or 98 an immediately hop to script ones

=== @ Moosh 02/22/2022 01:49

And that was really the final straw because `General Purpose 1 (Scripts)` is kinda an awkward name to adapt to

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/22/2022 01:50

Oh god ü§¢
Something else to add to the pile

=== @ Moosh 02/22/2022 01:50

...or maybe it was always called that
I've always just called it Script 1

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/22/2022 01:51

The constant in std
Is `CT_SCRIPT1`
But that's always been the editor name

=== @ Moosh 02/22/2022 01:52

Yeah for once the constant is the simpler name.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 11:57

The ID search thing is still not done, but, flags now should be alphabetized
