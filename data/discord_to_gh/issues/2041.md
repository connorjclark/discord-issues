As you can see the shooter refuses to aim at the player (four directionally I might add) if the value is set to -1 and it's supposed to. If -1 doesn't work, chances are -2 (eight directions) and -3 (full angular) don't work as well

"chances are" means nothing
the 3 modes there use entirely separate code and have literally nothing to do with each other
so 1 being broken does not mean the other 2 are broken

I can confirm that -2 and -3 work. -1 is the only broken one
