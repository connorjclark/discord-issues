As of latest nightly, Zquest crashes when I click the grab button in the tile editor.  No error message, just instantly crashes out.

it's setting the first tile to 0 format / null data then trying to draw it ...

this caching code is what _prevented_ it from crashing before

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2023 02:33

til you can hold down the cursor in the grab screen to go off grid

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2023 02:53

fixed for next nightly
also got to delete the most nasty code

fyi grabbing still broken, looking more

=== @ cbailey78 11/04/2023 03:49

I'm in the hospital from the "Grab" crash, it deployed an airbag from my laptop and got broken bones!

=== @ cbailey78 11/04/2023 04:28

Now that the tile grabber no longer crashes, but when I grab a tile from any source file, the bottom half of each tile is blank.
let's say I wanna grab a bridge from willow,

=== @ cbailey78 11/04/2023 04:31

It loads only the top half of the tiles circled in red.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2023 18:48

@ Majora / @ cbailey78 next nightly ~40m should be better - please let me know if still finding issues.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2023 18:53
