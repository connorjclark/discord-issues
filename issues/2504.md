This is a new issue I do not recall ever having (as of the June 28th build) where F6ing manually is fine, but when I dies I get this. Currently in the July 5th build and still seeing the issue. I do have an OnDeath script that has not been touched in years.

I can enter the menu and reset the player but no save or continue menu

Is this test mode only or no?
And if replay recording is on - does disabling it change anything?

=== @ P-Tux7 07/07/2023 22:33

is the font colour and background colour the same

=== @ Deathrider 07/08/2023 01:03

I am not in test mode, and no they are not. I am not hearing the death music
pressing any button does nothing

I figured out the issue. there must have been a change recently that made it where if you have an OnDeath script slotted it exclusively runs that. So my basic OnDeath that just does a health check and does not handle the death screen leaves me at a blank screen. I am not sure if that is a bug (that does make sense to be intentional for those with fully custom death screens) or not but some confirmation would be appreciated since that would mean I need to script the rest of it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2023 17:44

How recently?

=== @ Deathrider 07/08/2023 20:38

first started seeing it wiht the june 28th build

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2023 20:58

Can you provide a qst file? Keep in mind that though I can fix things I'm not as familiar with these systems as you are, so I need a simple test case to jumpstart my debugging.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2023 20:59

Best if recreating the problem in a new quest file

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2023 21:11

I may have found the problem tho

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 01:51

Do you still want more info? I can make a test quest

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 01:52

Did the new nightly fix it?

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 01:54

I can check

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 01:56

Well I get the proper death menu, but it seems I do not die when I am dead

let me confirm this though, I am able to replicate it but it could also be that I have the red mail
and my hearts dont represent eighths

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 02:00

ok yep, this bug is fixed

=== @ Deathrider 07/09/2023 02:04

I am not handling health representation well for upgraded armors

=== @ P-Tux7 07/09/2023 02:05

(replying to @ Deathrider "Well I get the proper death m…"): kids today

=== @ Deathrider 07/10/2023 01:20

I am not experiencing this issue anymore
