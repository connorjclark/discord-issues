I found a possible compatibility minor bug, unless there's a new quest rule that makes it work.

Reproduction steps:
* Play Link to Tortuga: https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&id=158
* Grab a fairy in any room with "Hold up Item" screen flag
* Fairy SFX plays a zillion times

I can't reproduce this in a fully fresh quest file

Tested on `nightly-2023-10-22-3` for OSX

Oh yeah, I've seen it in one shop in HowHigh (1.90) with a moving fairy. But I thought I remembered that getting fixed long ago.

in tortuga I set a fairy as the screen item w/ the hold up flag and don't see it

`qr_HOLDITEMANIMATION`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/11/2023 10:01

only happens when that QR is off

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/11/2023 10:05

it's because `dummy` flag is not set for putitem, which ends up playing a sfx every frame the item is drawn overhead
