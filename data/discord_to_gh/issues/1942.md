I just updated to the latest nightly and now when I start the game up, it’s all black screen even when it’s minimized.

Also i am using x86

Hmm, I couldn't repro this. But maybe the next nightly in 30m will fix it.

So you just don't see anything at all? No title screen, or is it nothing after a save file is selected?
