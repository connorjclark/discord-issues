I figured a dropdown box with the string preview would be easier for everyone?

oh, like the room data string preview?

=== @ Jared 04/21/2023 21:51

Exactly!

hmm... might tweak the bottom a bit

There we go, info buttons for those to be more clear. Got a question about them the other day, might as well put the explaination in.

So awesome Em. You're the best ❤️

I wish it was easy for Emily to do the same with combo attribute tabs for decoration sprite, SFX, Item dropset, etc.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 00:01

(replying to @ cbailey78 "I wish it was easy for Emily…"): Attributes can't have that done, because of how the gui would have to change when you change combo types
(replying to @ cbailey78 "I wish it was easy for Emily…"): but, the `Wizard` button pretty much does exactly what you're asking for...

=== @ cbailey78 05/01/2023 00:02

Oh yeah, the wizard thing thankfully! Fair enough.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 00:02

That's basically the entire reason the wizard exists, is because I couldn't just do it in the attributes. And it makes some of the more complex setups a LOT easier for people to understand.
