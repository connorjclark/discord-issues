For liquid combo types, add an attribute where the player can assign an SFX ID to play if Link drowns in the liquid.

I've tried using `Step->Trigger tile, play SFX` when triggered to emulate this, but it's a bit janky regarding what position Link must be on to trigger the step effect.

that wouldn't be a good way to go about it
maybe if you made it `Step->Sensitive`
but that might play it every frame
and, if you can ever swim, that won't work
so

adding this was like 4 lines of code, should be done

@ Matthew care to test?

=== @ Matthew 10/10/2022 14:55

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Matthew care to…"): About to run off to some meetings, when I get home I can test it!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 14:55

k ❤️

=== @ Matthew 10/10/2022 14:55

I figured this would probably be an easy add so I'm glad it was just 4 lines
Just a thing that makes a quest feel more kinesthetic and polished.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 14:55

1 line was naming it in the combo editor
1 line was adding help text in the combo editor
2 lines were reading the sfx from the combo, then playing it
that easy lol

=== @ Matthew 10/10/2022 14:59
