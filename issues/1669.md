An item that let's you sets the divisor of any counter (including customs). With item bundles, there's no worrying about if a single item could effect multiple counters at once, just put different divisor items in an item bundle

With the way this works, it would require 30 different item classes
because every counter
needs to be a separate class
for it to work
this has been discussed before and shot down for this exact reason

Should we, in the future, start a feature request channel for rewrite to organise all current turn-downs?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/06/2022 22:38

I mean
the theoretical thing to do is to check if it's been requested before
though that's not exactly easy
though to be fair
if you search for `in: feature-requests counter`
there are only like 38 results
and on the first page of those results is a duplicate of this request
so, mayhaps try using discord's search tools before making a request?

Thanks, the inner workings of discord still elude me üòù

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/06/2022 22:45

discord's search tools are REALLY nice
and searching in a channel includes that channel's threads
which I actually hadn't tested until just now

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "With the way this works, it w‚Ä¶"): wait, how many counters are there?!?

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2022 01:22

lessee...
‚úÖ damage taken
magic used
‚úÖ rupee cost
arrow cost
bomb cost
super bomb cost
key cost
current level key cost?
and however many custom/generic/bonus/script/whatever you call it counters there are
i think i've requested a magic divisor ring already, that would be the big useful one imo

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùåüîíBasic Counter Divisor Item

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i think i've requested a magi‚Ä¶"): The problem is, dividing your magic use isn't even. If you use the drain rate multiplier properly (which is what half magic uses), you can create whatever divisors you want, with scripts; allowing half, quarter, eighth, etc magic
that's the best way to handle it
You can do it without any scripts if you use "Learn Half Magic" rooms, which, with compat qrs off, will halve the drain rate each time
with scripts you can do much more
