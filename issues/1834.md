Similar to a statue. Good for 2.10 bosses with combo-cycling, moving FFCs, or booby trapped Next combos or secret combos. This can be seen as an in-engine and extended version of the Timed Shooter FFC script. The benefits are that this is less random than statues, there is no statue enemy to hurt Link for a non-solid shooter, and it can move as an FFC unlike statue enemies. It really helps with some danmaku boss ideas and room hazard ideas I had for my current project idea.

Attributes
-EWeapon
-Angle:
--0-360: A constant degree
-- -1: Aimed at Link in 4-way
-- -2: Aimed at Link in 8-way
-- -3: Aimed perfectly at Link
-Shot Type (like walking enemies)
-Shot Speed
-Shot Sprite
-Shot Rate Constant Rate/Lower Random Range
-Shot Rate Upper Random Range
-Minimum Player Distance (in pixels)

Flags:
-Random (the shooting timer is constant. The upper random range attribute is used in this configuration. If not set to random, the Lower Random Range attribute is used as a constant timer.)
-Spawn Weapon Immediately Upon Existing
-Requires Minimum Player Distance (like the Z1 statues, it will not fire if the player is close enough. Uses the attribute above)
-Is Boss-Level Projectile

Oh this would be awesome.

It's all anyone's ever wanted regarding projectiles.
... and non-scripting phobias.

ok god dammit p-tux you requested a lot here
pretty fancy request, not easy to fill
.....and yet, I have *most* of it done
(I didn't add shot types or a boss fireball checkbox)
(but shooting single weapons seems to work perfectly)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2022 13:37

ahk, it's done
it can shoot multiple weapons, with whatever arc between them you like
can shoot boss fireballs with a checkbox
can use the unblockable flags
can attach a weapon script (by ID number) to its' spawned weapons

... you're a madwoman.  Can't wait to test that out.  Thank you so much!  This really puts non-scripted custom bosses ahead by ten steps.
