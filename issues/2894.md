You sure those are set up right? You have two checking for a value of `3` and none checking for a value of `1`...

=== @ Zaxarone 12/07/2023 02:11

i have it set up as 1>2>3

=== @ Zaxarone 12/07/2023 02:12

sorry for not posting the right scrrenshots. i was toying with the nummbers ot get it to work hopefully

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/07/2023 02:24

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/07/2023 02:36

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "it uses long doesn't it?"): @ Moosh just making you aware of this lovely tidbit...

=== @ Moosh 12/07/2023 02:42

oh. OHHHH
Zax put these together using the SCC button. Is that perhaps not accounting for these being long?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/07/2023 02:46

no, the string editor side is fine
the error is in your script
he told it to check for `>=1L, >=2L, >=3L` in the string editor
and you set it to `1, 2, 3` in the script, instead of `1L, 2L, 3L`
so, you were setting it 10000* higher than it was expected to be

...could add `Value is long` to an infotext somewhere

huhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/07/2023 02:58

oh oops missed something somewhere

=== @ Zaxarone 12/07/2023 02:58

actually  i  can take  this to dm since its  njot a zc bug
apologies

=== @ Moosh 12/07/2023 23:04

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...could add `Value is long`‚Ä¶"): Yeah that's what I meant. There's no indication in zstrings.txt or the string editor that the min value is long. Upon a bit of consideration it makes sense because there's no way to have a decimal point in an SCC, but I had assumed it was int. Especially since this SCC existed pre-2.55

=== @ Moosh 12/07/2023 23:07

Also that Screen->D[] itself isn't documented as long. It's documented as untyped/float depending on version.
So I'd expect the string editor to have a text field with four decimal places
