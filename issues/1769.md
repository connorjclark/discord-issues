My laptop doesn't have dedicated Pg Up and Pg Dn buttons. Only the numpad secondary functions. This makes navigating tile and combo pages rather inconvenient.

Can you post a picture so I know for sure what you are referring to

I think I do just wanna be sure

indeed, does nothing on mine either
and the reason would be quite simple
even with numlock off, it still reads just the key

=== @ Moosh 07/22/2022 23:34

Yeah I figured

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 23:34

so all ZC knows is that `KEY_3_PAD` was pressed
and nothing at all checks numlock anywhere
what it needs to understand is that `KEY_3_PAD` with `Numlock == false` is `KEY_PGDN`

Had a similar issue with synaptics gestures not registering as a scrollwheel. Imagine that's way more complicated though and probably can't be fixed. Thankfully I don't have to put up with it anymore üòÑ

does allegro 4 /alpha 107 detect it?

=== @ Moosh 07/23/2022 08:19

nah. I don't think ZQuest has ever detected that key combination
