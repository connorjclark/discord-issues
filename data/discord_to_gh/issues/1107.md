Right now, in order to temporarily disable the shield, you have to grant a higher level shield with no block flags and then remove it appropriately.  Would be nice to have a `Hero` variable that would do this instead

This is different than flagging projectiles as unblockable - I need to do this in a lot of custom item scripts that have animations where the shield should not be active (e.g. custom slash/stab items or items with charge animations)

I mean, you could remove the shield
or edit it's `itemdata`
to remove the blockflags

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2021 16:49

all of these things seem equally fussy to me
editing the itemdata most-so because incorrectly restoring them is really bad
although I guess incorrectly removing the dummy shield is also bad so maybe not worse

a disable shield variable might not be hard to do
I'll look into it

I mean if it's an absolute nightmare I can definitely manage
but it's one of the fussiest things I run into regularly

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "a disable shield variable mig‚Ä¶"): it might be worth looking into link's invincibility code
in that state his shield reacts with nothing
much ire with blue/mirror wizzrobes has been had
