It does work for other items, but seemingly only not for shields.

If you disable shields via the DMap editor it works properly.

Tested in the 2nd nightly build of 3rd of April

...So, I don't see why this would have anything to do with shields
but, I believe you may have simply mis-diagnosed the issue
It appears that, on script changing an item's disabled state, it is NOT clearing that item type's item cache entry. Which could cause it to still return a disabled item from the get item function.
Should be fixed in next build @ Rebonite
test when you can

Thank you! I will test today
"Which could cause it to still return a disabled item from the get item function"
I don't know what you mean by that, unless you mean that `getItem` is internal code? I just want the Hero to be vulnerable to projectiles when disabling the shield.

(replying to @ Twilight Knight "Thank you! I will test today‚Ä¶"): yeah, in the internal code
so it was returning `Yeah here's the shield to use` without checking that that shield was disabled

Ah I understand
It works now, tested in the latest nightly üëç
