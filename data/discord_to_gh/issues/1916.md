A simple request from a simple person.  Shift-clicking on a Favorited Combo would scroll to that combo.  This is a quality of life thing designed for speed, like keyboard shortcuts in photoshop.

A less humble request is to have ZQuest's currently selected Cset also change to that Favorited Combo.

A far less humble, and downright malicious request, is to have a ZQuest Option toggle to have ZQuest changing its Cset after shift-clicking as a feature.  This is considerably less of a priority, if at all.

Shift-click is already used though
that's how you overwrite a favorite combo with a new combo

(and ctrl is how you clear it)

Aww.  Alt-Click?

I'm trying it now, and it seems to be.
America-level Free.

Added.
(meta) thread name was changed: Alt-Click on a Favorited Combo scrolls to it.
