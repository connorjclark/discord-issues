The following classes, similar to LTTP or later games, would have options for their projectiles to be blocked by any combo detected as solid. These would run the usual animation when blocked by an enemy, so for example an arrow would have that "tink" thing.
-Arrow (the projectile)
-Boomerang
-Candle (the projectile)
-Cane of Byrna(beam, low priority)
-Din's Fire(this has been postulated to probably not be possible)
-Magic Book (applies to wand fire)
-Sword (the beam)
-Wand (the magic, creates fire if book is owned)
I think Generic Combos have projectile-blocking features, but this would apply to all solid combos, and would check their solidity quadrants.
