as of the latest build and the previous build of ZC, I've been running into a problem where both Zeldaclassic and Zquest closes instantly after starting, just a brief black screen before it fails to launch. If it helps I am using Windows 7 64-bit.
I did not have this problem until very recently, so it must be something that was changed on your end.

Upload the allegro.log please

=== @ cbailey78 12/11/2022 18:28

I am having the exact same problem. I'm using Win 7 64 bit to as well.  I found a workaround to make it work.  First, launching ZQ or ZC in fullscreen make it work. Then you can Alt+Enter if you prefer windowed.  This is my temporary solution for now.

nothing useful there

=== @ FireSeraphim 12/12/2022 10:06

Sorry

=== @ FireSeraphim 12/12/2022 12:55

Still persisting in the latest build

I'm going backwards through and getting fresh copies of previous versions of ZC and testing them until I find the last previous one that worked for me and did not crash. Maybe by this method we can pinpoint which build broke ZC on Windows 7
nightly 20-22-12-08-2 results: it crashed like the the latest build

=== @ FireSeraphim 12/13/2022 16:50

nightly-2022-11-28 works on my end

=== @ FireSeraphim 12/13/2022 16:51

So the culprit for what's causing the latest build ZC to not work on my computer is something you changed in the nightly-2022-11-29 build of zelda classic
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) I hope this bit of testing on my ends helps to narrow it down

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2022 03:05

This is likely related to Windows 7, which I don't have access to a machine with that to test.
That OS, btw, was EOL by Microsoft 2 years ago. Can you upgrade?

=== @ FireSeraphim 12/14/2022 03:46

No. And I refuse to because windows 8, 10 and 11 are orwellian nightmares that are actively hostile to attempts to get a classic desktop experience and who's update options are non-existent (in the fact that you no longer have the option to be notified of the update and be allowed to choose whether or not to up, you also no long have the option to opt out) and lack transparency on the update contents. Also the newer OSes are always online, and I could go on and on.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2022 04:09

Maybe try Ubuntu when it works then. That's what I'm working on right now, and I don't see me prioritizing fixing this given _this OS is literally unsupported by it's creator_ now.

=== @ FireSeraphim 12/14/2022 04:19

I don't know how to and I don't want to bother with linux

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2022 04:27

@<role: Developer> if someone has win7 I'd be happy to help debug this over video chat

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2022 13:34

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "No. And I refuse to because w‚Ä¶"): Well win7 is getting pretty outdated at this point, so you're gonna start running into problems with things

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/14/2022 16:28

Yeah sorry, I don't have windows 7
I'm on Win 10

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2022 16:30

Same

=== @ cbailey78 12/14/2022 17:32

It's a good thing that I can get Zquest to work by launching it in fullscreen, then alt+enter to switch to windowed mode.  I hope this workaround works for you guys.

=== @ FireSeraphim 12/17/2022 13:11

@ cbailey78 it doesn't work for me. I barely have time to even try before it crashes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/19/2022 10:24

(meta) thread name was changed: [Win7][nightly-2022-12-11] Zquest and Zeldaclassic fails to load, crashes after launch.

=== @ FireSeraphim 12/25/2022 19:53

allegro.log from the newest nightly. I've been testing each new release since this bug report and I'm still running into this problem.

=== @ FireSeraphim 01/23/2023 16:17

Holy shit
I don't know what you guys did but the newest nightly build now works on my computer
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) You can consider this bug reported addressed and fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/23/2023 16:18

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Thank god because we literally had 0 ways to debug this
....either some random thing connor did fixed it
or something that changed on your computer fixed it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2023 16:46

It was you who fixed it Emily
With ignoring monitor dpi

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/23/2023 17:00

OH

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/23/2023 17:01

Thank... was it Deathrider?
for complaining about that not being togglable
so I made it a config, and defaulted it *off*

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2023 17:02

I need to change it to be windows only because only windows does something by default

On Mac the default window is sized for ants because of how we define it
At least, default to ignoring for windows only I guess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/23/2023 17:03

ah, k
should be simple enough at least
