Can we have a way to have signpost combos draw input prompts when the player can read them? This makes it easier to read when they can be talked to, especially when used in tandem with NPC scripts like Moosh NPC.

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒Signposts draw prompts when player can read them.
prompt is drawn *EXACTLY* above the player, as part of the player's draw
combo, cset, xoffset, yoffset configurable per-combo
and a generic version to use with whatever you'd like

Oooh nice

A combo of `0` will be ignored, as usual

The prompt on the right blinks in the video when I press the button; you could set that combo to do `->Next`, or trigger secrets, etc on that buttonpress as well, in which case the prompt would not re-appear after disappearing
