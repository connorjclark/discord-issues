So I'm looking at how I detect a collision with this event and while it can tell me _what_ combo hit Link, it can't tell me _where_ it was on the screen. Because I'm not in a combodata script, combodata->X, combodata->Y, and combodata->Pos will error. I'm also noticing there is no OBJTYPE_FFC. Are FFCs just combos internally? Could there be a way to tell if a combo that collided with Link was an FFC and which one it was?

(as an aside, finally found a reason to use these, damn this shit is SMOOTH)

ffcs I believe would trigger as a combo hitting

Sweet! Thanks!

it's a separate thing
to preserve compat with old scripts, partly

makes sense

so
```cpp
enum //Game->EventData[] indexes for 'GENSCR_EVENT_HERO_HIT_1' and 'GENSCR_EVENT_HERO_HIT_2'
{
    GENEV_HEROHIT_DAMAGE, //Damage to be taken
    GENEV_HEROHIT_HITDIR, //Dir to be knocked in
    GENEV_HEROHIT_NULLIFY, //Bool: to nullify the hit, or not
    GENEV_HEROHIT_NAYRUON, //Bool: if nayru's love will nullify the damage, or not
    GENEV_HEROHIT_IFRAMES, //Number of IFrames to have after hit, if not nullified
    GENEV_HEROHIT_HITTYPE, //What type of object is hitting the hero ('OBJTYPE_')
    GENEV_HEROHIT_HITOBJ, //The pointer to that object
    GENEV_HEROHIT_HITTYPE2, //A second type of object (sometimes 'OBJTYPE_NONE')
    GENEV_HEROHIT_HITOBJ2 //The pointer to the second object
};```
There's `HITTYPE2`/`HITOBJ2`
FFC and Combo both will trigger with `HITTYPE = COMBODATA`, `HITOBJ` = `<combodata>` type
but
ffc with have `HITTYPE2 = FFC`, `HITOBJ2 = <ffc>` type
and combo will have `HITTYPE2 = COMBOPOS`, `HITOBJ2 = <int>` type
```cpp
generic script EventTest
{
    void run()
    {
        while(true)
        {
            int ev = WaitEvent();
            switch(ev)
            {
                case GENSCR_EVENT_HERO_HIT_1:
                {
                    int ty = Game->EventData[GENEV_HEROHIT_HITTYPE2];
                    untyped val = Game->EventData[GENEV_HEROHIT_HITOBJ2];
                    printf("%d,%d\n", ty, val);
                    switch(ty)
                    {
                        case OBJTYPE_FFC:
                        {
                            ffc f = val;
                            f->CSet = 7;
                            break;
                        }
                        case OBJTYPE_COMBOPOS:
                        {
                            int pos = val;
                            Screen->ComboC[pos] = 7;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    if(Hero->HP < 16) Hero->HP = 16;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}```
here was my test script
...this script would get very confused if anything but a combo hit the player, but, it was a simple test.
should show how the new shit works well enough
