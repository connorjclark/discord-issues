(Screenshot just shows the relevant screen.)

When testing a quest through the test quest dialog and loading a custom init data, any pre-defined screen data from the custom data size gets reset. This is undesirable for testing because scripts that rely on reading that data will break as a result of trying to test a screen with custom inventories.

A simple change would be to simply not change screen data settings with a custom init data, since I don't see the point of being able to even change that with custom init data, but any way to be able to preserve that and have scripts function correctly will be appreciated.

^ TL;DR @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) some fields should be specifically excluded from test init data (any that are not editable from the init data dialog, I'd say; which importantly here includes the screen data)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 05:27

Should all the things in Script be ignored, just using what the qst defines?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 05:30

maybe even use the same dialog as the Init Data cheat dialog in player
so pass `true` to doInit
totally hides the Script tab
hides other stuff too tho
I think I need a list of things we certainly don't want before I can start on this.

fix is something like

```diff
diff --git a/src/zc/zelda.cpp b/src/zc/zelda.cpp

+        auto screen_data_backup = zinit.screen_data;
         zinit.clear();

         zinitdata* new_init = apply_init_data_delta(&zinit, testingqst_init_data, error);

             zinit = *new_init;
             resetItems(game, new_init, false);
             ringcolor(false);
```

and ensuring that variable is just not serialized in the delta string. only thing that _needs_ to be in the delta string are whatever we want cheats to work for (the Init Data cheat menu) or this test feature. screen_data is already not in the delta string, but it was being zero-init above.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) halp"): Your prior message sounds right

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/21/2023 02:54

thinking of changing this delta string to be relative to the qst, as was brought up before. not so convinced it is more useful relative to the base
just makes updating these test inits cumbersome after changing anything in init data...
and complicates this bug fix

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/21/2023 05:05

Marking fixed, not release yet tho.
