The way this was implemented means even the .zplay recording does not know about  bad inputs. This results in error SFX not playing when bad input is used on a replay (since that input is never even recorded!)

A meta note, this makes any test zplay for ensuring this combo type does not regress impossible to make.

*oof*, that would be an issue lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/30/2023 02:08

Only noticed b/c I was assessing some zplays @ Majora sent me. thx

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/30/2023 02:08

yeah he literally mentioned making a recording for those in a convo earlier

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/30/2023 02:09

(meta) thread name was changed: Cutscene combos prevent zplay recording inputs

Think I probably fixed this? @ Majora will need to rerecord cutscene trigger replays in next build to test

hello here is the replay. I edited the quest to set a proper error sound (65) to the cutscene combo.
