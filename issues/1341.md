I'm not sure if this was implemented, as I did ask about it before but lost track of it. Is it possible to add a flag that always makes you face a certain way when on a combo? This would make it so climbing ladders on mountains (etc) would look more accurate.

this'd need to be a new combo type

Oh okay

Idea: combine this with slow walk and use attributes for step speed, direction (0 or something for being not a fixed direction), and LTM (for climbing animation should quest maker choose)

you mean non sideview right?
there's a QR to make you always face up on sideview ladders
oh yeah both slow walk and sideview ladders would benefit from settable speed
multiplicative of hero step
for all his assholery james24 had a good idea combining floors that made you move fast with just as fast enemies

That sounds terrifyingly fun
