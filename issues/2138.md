Ends up calling MAPCOMBO2 with a layer of -2, which I assume is not the intention. Maybe wanted `check_hshot(0` instead of `check_hshot(-1`? @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
only noticed because I have a helpful `DCHECK_LAYER_NEG1_INDEX(layer);` thing in my z3 branch to catch mistakes like this
also have `DCHECK_LAYER_ZERO_INDEX`
so fun that both are a thing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2023 07:11

no bug really, the MAPCOMBO2 treats both -2 and -1 as the actual screen, just wanna check it makes sense to change these -1 constants to 0

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2023 07:37

I think 0 is layer 1 and 1 is layer 2? unsure though

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2023 07:40

No, it varies. sometimes 0 is the actual screen, sometimes that is -1

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2023 07:41

weird... and MAPCOMBO2 doesn't do anything special with it being a negative?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2023 07:41

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "no bug really, the MAPCOMBO2‚Ä¶"): it does
Just checking, the intention here is just look at the actual screen, not a layer, ya?
for `check_hshot(-1`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2023 07:42

I'd need to look; I don't remember off the top of my head

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2023 07:44

why is it -1??

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2023 07:46

Yeah go ahead and change those to check_hshot(0

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/23/2023 07:48

I can only assume I was either braindead at the time or the code I was rewriting also did that and I just didn't catch it (see: braindead)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2023 07:50

It's not your brain's fault haha, the layer indexing is just very easy to mess up

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2023 02:40

oh sometimes it's 1-6 too!
prob a real bug here:

0 then minus one then used as array index üëÄ
