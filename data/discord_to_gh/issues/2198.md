In older versions of ZC if you took a snapshot while on a screen with "No Subscreen" toggled, it would produce a smaller, 256x168 image.
This worked up through the 12-15 Nightly
I posted a bug about the 12-31 Nightly not respecting "No Subscreen" with snapshots, as it produced this as an image.

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) (hope you can take a look at this)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 19:16

All snapshots since have been 256 x 224.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 02/25/2023 19:17

I only noticed when I took a snapshot of a screen with a non-black background and no Subscreen Offset and it looks like this.

A large, black box at the top that kinda... stands out.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/11/2023 00:03

Still including the blackspace in 113. While kinda minor, it does stand out in screenshots like the sample above and also makes tile grabbing from such screenshots more difficult (when the blackspace is not included, it nicely aligns tiles to the grid)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 08/08/2023 15:36

Still present in 116. Have been wondering if this is something that could have an option to toggle this behavior. I prefer there to be no extra blackspace, but it does make snapshots have a consistent size.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/26/2023 06:52

pushed fix to main
Did this work correctly at any point? Looks like it may have always cut off the top row of tiles or so, not sure. it's good now.

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 21:29

Was this one tested and confirmed fixed at any point? I tried using snapshot on a screen with no subscreen and got this.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 21:29

Yeah it def worked after I worked on it last

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 21:30

okay, odd

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 21:30

I could see subscreen refactor breaking this - was that after last aug?
I'll check it out in a bit.

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 21:32

Seems it was before? Overlay subscreen commit was dated august 20th

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 21:33

except wait, that's when it was committed to Emily's branch, not to main, right?

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 21:35

hmm, that was the same day as the merge though. I dunno then

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 22:18

Okay well I found the cause of the thing but I'm a little confused what's going on here with git
```    if (tmpscr->flags3&fNOSUBSCR && !(key[KEY_ALT]))
    {
        BITMAP *b = create_bitmap_ex(8,256,168);
        clear_to_color(b,0);
        blit(framebuf,b,0,passive_subscreen_height/2,0,0,256,168);
        alleg4_save_bitmap(b, SnapshotScale, buf);
        destroy_bitmap(b);
    }
    else
    {
        alleg4_save_bitmap(framebuf, SnapshotScale, buf, realpal?temppal:RAMpal);
    }```
alleg4_save_bitmap in the first case here isn't supplying a palette

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 22:19

Thing is I did a blame and...
https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/6bef101a2ec82be5e6830c4cc134eebbfc1ac765
The commit it's giving me isn't even using that function and also has the fixed code already

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 22:25

Also there's a second, rarely used flag "...But Don't Offset Screen" that isn't being accounted for here

re: git blame, I dont see that I see https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/d4a3aa3b8bf49adfa91854fbfe49340b8bd00cb8
Where do you view git blame from?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 22:30

(replying to @ Moosh "Also there's a second, rarely…"): isn't that onGUISnapshot?
its the actual bitmap drawn to the window, so its huge. but is exactly what you see on screen
onSnapshot toggles between the two

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 22:33

I did
```$ git blame src/zc/zc_sys.cpp -L3986,3993
```

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 22:35

I'm a dummy
the commit hashes were different and I grabbed the wrong one
🤦

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 22:35

yeah easy to miss
so the commit `feat: add configuration for snapshot image scale` removed the pal param here...
can't recall why
maybe I did a bad merge
on my own commit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 22:38

onMapscrSnapshot uses this method and previously it would get the default, current palette
I saw that and made it the default behavior for alleg4_save_bitmap if no pal given
but dont think the other usage should have changed from what it was

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 22:45

okay, re-fixed and cherry picked

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 22:46

thanks!
(replying to @ Moosh "Also there's a second, rarely…"): btw is the gui snapshot thing handling what you were referring to?

=== @ Moosh 01/24/2024 22:48

You mean the ZQuest one? It didn't need to because it only shows in ZC

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/24/2024 22:48

oh this is a screen rule
