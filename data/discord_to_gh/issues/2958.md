Enter a cheat code. Pick your cheat level. Then die. It's now back to 0. ZC remembers that you've entered the code, but you have to go back into the menu and set the level again. Makes things really obnoxious. It's doing this in the latest 2.55 build. It didn't seem to be doing it recently, but I certainly couldn't tell you when it broke. It works properly in test mode, however.

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) probably something to do with the save/titlescreen/continue stuff?
