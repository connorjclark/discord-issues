This would let you assign a hotkey or set as a favorite command when you right-click over a command in the menu, so you wouldn't have to search through the whole list of commands just to find the one you are looking for, only for it not to be there. Or perhaps the list of commands that can be favorited or assigned to a hotkey could be organized in the same way as commands are (__F__ile, __Q__uest, __E__dit, __V__iew, __T__ools, __S__creen, __Z__script, Et__C__)

err
...gonna have to go with "no"
firstly, hotkeys and favorite commands are two entirely unrelated systems that do not in any way interact
so, uh, BOTH systems would need to be rewritten to be compatible with each other
and then.... right click on what?
if you mean on the *main menu*, firstly, it's not like that contains every favorite command / hotkey anyway
and secondly, that would require doing a large amount of gui code rewriting
so, this would require a MASSIVE amount of work

oh
I wasn't sure how much work it would be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 22:40

yeah, this is like, rewriting a large portion of the ZQ code relating to 3 separate major systems

=== @ Seboops 06/15/2023 23:12

same goes for reorganizing the hotkey/favorite command select menus to correspond with the top bar?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 23:14

The things in those menus don't *correspond* to the top bar, is the thing
there are commands that simply aren't in the top bar
some things in the top bar may have multiple commands related
the systems just *don't match*

=== @ Seboops 06/15/2023 23:14

oh
Well I hope that one day the hotkeys menu is organized alphabetically then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 23:15

could probably add a search bar or something?

=== @ Seboops 06/15/2023 23:15

yeah
like in other menus

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 23:15

hotkeys are fairly new
also, searching a list, and searching a *scrollpane of various widgets*, are ENTIRELY different tasks
so, not exactly like most other menus
(it would be specifically more like the `Quest Rules Search` menu)
but yeah, hotkeys used to be all hardcoded and not configurable at all
and I went through and rewrote the entire system
(meta) thread name was changed: Hotkey menu 'search'

=== @ Seboops 06/15/2023 23:18

Yeah I used to use 5.53 and it was like that
