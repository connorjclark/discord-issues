I want to have certain subscreen pages skipped while scrolling to the next page, since i wanna have a couple other pages only accessed by a widget selection. so having an option in the subscreen settings to skip pages while scrolling between them, and an option to make other pages not able to be scrolled from would be perfect.

This would be great. If you need a temporary solution btw you can do something like this in an active subscreen script e.g. to skip page 5:
`if (this->CurPage == 4 && Input->Button[CB_R]){this->TransToPage = 6;}`
`if (this->CurPage == 6 && Input->Button[CB_L]){this->TransToPage = 4;}`

(replying to @ Attempt "I want to have certain subscr…"): you could use the "goto page" widget feature?

not sure how useful it is for this though, don't remember exact details

=== @ Attempt 11/15/2023 19:47

Yeah that's the idea. I wanna use the go to page for specific screens that i don't want to scroll to traditionally.

(replying to @ Attempt "Yeah that's the idea. I wanna…"): so, yeah, that's a thing
in the selection tab
...I don't think this will work for just pressing L/R anywhere
but having a prev/next button that you *select* this would work
Could work for something like a Paper Mario subscreen with tabs at the top for each page, just select a tab to pick the page

=== @ Attempt 11/15/2023 19:53

Yeah that could. I just thought it'd be neat to have some pages that i could scroll normally when pressing l/r anywhere, like the main ones like items and gear, while having other screens only accessed by widget selection like a quest list and collectable screens.

=== @ Attempt 11/15/2023 19:54

So that the player doesn't have to press l/r a bunch of times to get to the screen they want just to swap out their items or whatnot.
It's definitely a niche feature.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2023 19:59

yeah, not gonna be a priority
but I'll leave it on the list

Sounds good
