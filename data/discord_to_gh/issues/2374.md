Hi Connor,
I've just checked the web version again after a while and first off it's working wonderfully well. Awesome work üôå 

Also amazing you can load quests right from the database and even view info about them.

But I noticed that the credits are not correct, but instead re-use the same text as the story part. See the screenshot for an example.

Hmm you can also open passworded quests in the editor, that doesn't seem right to me

=== @ Russ 05/17/2023 12:33

The password thing is intended. Passwords have been trivial to bypass for a while (there‚Äôs a widely circulated master password for most versions of ZC), and with the engine being open source, passwording basically can‚Äôt be done anyways, so the web version just drops pretenses

=== @ Twilight Knight 05/17/2023 12:35

Hmm that's true indeed
I do reckon new players don't know any of that though
To me it doesn't really matter, nothing to hide üòÑ

=== @ Russ 05/17/2023 12:37

Yeah, I feel like the password set screen oughta have a big ole disclaimer

=== @ Twilight Knight 05/17/2023 12:43

Or just get rid of passwords all together üòÇ
I like the idea of the quests being open-source as well and it being clear

=== @ Russ 05/17/2023 12:44

I mean, they effectively are already

(replying to @ Russ "Yeah, I feel like the passwor‚Ä¶"): it does, at someone's request... might have even been yours?

=== @ Russ 05/17/2023 12:54

Oh, huh
Yeah that might‚Äôve been me. I‚Äôve brought this up before
Been so long since I set passwords didn‚Äôt even know it was added

=== @ Twilight Knight 05/17/2023 13:05

Well, I'll just approach this by unsetting the password of my own quests then

Anyway, sorry for diverging from the actual topic hehe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/17/2023 13:20

The big thing is, quest files are NOT encrypted using your password. They never have been. So it has never actually secured anything.
Especially since ZQ is open source, anyone can just add `return true;` to the `is this the right password?` check, and make anything you enter count as valid for any quest. There's no real way around that.

I understand

hah, yeah lol, that'd do it

=== @ Twilight Knight 05/18/2023 12:15

Tnx for fixing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/28/2023 18:31

Fixed, will see next time I deploy web version.
