I've been mostly thinking about how useful the Newbie Boss and Item Scripts are while not hard to just add in though perhaps adding more diversity to the Enemy and Item editor would be better then having to make new enemy's and items from scratch.

err, so what's the feature request?

Sorry I got off track the Orignal idea was to update the Enemy and Item editors to be more like those Scripts allowing more complex ememies and bosses and Items
