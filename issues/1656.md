Quoting from another channel:
```So a bit of an optimization question. Say I have three bitmaps: two textures A and B, and an output bitmap.
Image
I want to fill in the green color of bitmap B with the texture of bitmap A and then put the output in bitmap C. I also don't want to overwrite any of the data in A and B in the process
Is there a way to do with without introducing a fourth bitmap?
Also the pink in this case is color 0```

This would be made easier with a version of MaskedDraw that uses a second bitmap as a texture instead of drawing a fixed color. It would also be nice to have some finer control over which colors are masked if possible. Right now it's anything that isn't color 0, but in the example case the optimal use would be a single color or the inverse of that color's space. Dunno how doable that is. MaskedBlit is the main request here.

```cpp
void MaskedDraw( int layer, bitmap mask, int color );
 * Draws 'color' to the bitmap, on any pixels that are non-color-0 on the mask.
 * The mask's `0,0` is overlayed at `0,0` of the destination.
void MaskedDraw( int layer, bitmap mask, int color, int maskColor );
 * Same as above, but instead of any non-0 pixels, pixels that match 'maskColor' are used
void MaskedDraw( int layer, bitmap mask, int color, int startMaskColor, int endMaskColor );
 * Same as above, but colors c such that 'startMaskColor <= c <= endMaskColor' will be used
 *  as the mask.

void MaskedBlit( int layer, bitmap mask, bitmap pattern, bool repeatPattern );
void MaskedBlit( int layer, bitmap mask, bitmap pattern, bool repeatPattern, int maskColor );
void MaskedBlit( int layer, bitmap mask, bitmap pattern, bool repeatPattern, int startMaskColor, int endMaskColor );
 * Same as 'MaskedDraw', but instead of drawing a color to the masked portions, draws from
 * a supplied 'pattern' bitmap.
 * If 'repeatPattern' is false, the pattern will be drawn at `0,0` with the width/height of the
 *     pattern bitmap, and nowhere else.
 * If 'repeatPattern' is true, the pattern will repeat in a tiled manner, starting from `0,0`,
 *     up to the width/height of the destination bitmap.
 * 'repeatPattern' does not affect the mask bitmap.```

@ Moosh would love a test on these

Also, curious if using a bitmap as a mask for itself would work
i.e.
`foo->MaskedBlit(0, foo, pattern, false, 0x52);`

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 10:40

I'd be happy to do some tests but it'll have to be later tonight. Don't let me forget. Drag my ass in there ü§£

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 10:41

if `foo` here were your face with the green, and `pattern` were your left bitmap, this should create your right bitmap, if I am correct
though, if you don't want to modify the green face one, you'd first want to just standard blit that to a copy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:00

well
I went to test it myself some
and everything crashes
so fun!

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:30

Splendid

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:31

so here I have a pattern (actually an array of patterns)
I have `bitmap face` which is the middle one
and then `bitmap foo` which is the bottom
```cpp
if(Hero->PressA)
{
    foo->Clear(0);
    face->Blit(0, foo, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false);
    pat = RandGen->Rand(NUM_TILES-1);
    foo->MaskedBlit(1, foo, patterns[pat], true, MASK_COLOR);
}
```
On pressing A, it clears foo, copies face to foo, picks a random pattern, and masks it

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:31

Does Screen have these functions as well?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:31

no, screen does not

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:32

k

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:32

which, given that these don't have any `x/y`, would be difficult to make useful

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:32

Ohhh that's true

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:32

It uses whichever is smaller of the target bitmap and the mask bitmap (smaller width and smaller height)

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:32

Was thinking ways to remove one more bitmap, but that'd complicate things some

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:33

If the `bool repeats` is false, it also will limit to the pattern bitmap's size
otherwise it tiles the destination with the pattern
here it specifies a singular `MASK_COLOR`, so only that color is replaced
seems to all work pretty nicely
also, I'm not adding a 'patterned' version of `Dither()`
you can basically do that yourself just by using `Dither` with a special color (one not used in the tile), and then `MaskedBlit`'ing that color

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:35

Yeah that's sensible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:36

The fun thing is, I set these up to avoid a lot of duplicate code

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:36

If I wanted to do that even without MaskedBlit, dither can do color 0 as well right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:36

Yes, you can dither color 0 onto things
Keep in mind that color 0 being transparent
....is a version of masking.
so, it's the same basic logic as MaskedBlit

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:37

Yeah, same idea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:38

Now for the neat thing
Script draw commands
How do they handle their arguments?
Well, they store all of their arguments in an array
so what do I do here that's fancy?
```cpp
case BMPMASKBLIT:
{
    set_user_bitmap_command_args(j, 4);
    script_drawing_commands[j][5] = 0x01 * 10000L;
    script_drawing_commands[j][6] = 0xFF * 10000L;
    script_drawing_commands[j][17] = SH::read_stack(ri->sp+4);
    break;
}
case BMPMASKBLIT2:
{
    set_user_bitmap_command_args(j, 5);
    script_drawing_commands[j][6] = script_drawing_commands[j][5];
    script_drawing_commands[j][0] = BMPMASKBLIT;
    script_drawing_commands[j][17] = SH::read_stack(ri->sp+5);
    break;
}
case BMPMASKBLIT3:
{
    set_user_bitmap_command_args(j, 6);
    script_drawing_commands[j][0] = BMPMASKBLIT;
    script_drawing_commands[j][17] = SH::read_stack(ri->sp+6);
    break;
}
```
So, if you call `MaskBlit()` with 4 params,
it basically just calls the 6 param version
with `0x01, 0xFF`
The 5 param version, calls the 6 param version by duplicating the parameter, so it has a range of just the one color

=== @ Moosh 06/10/2022 11:40

Nice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/10/2022 11:40

and they all set their 'command' back to `BMPMASKBLIT`, so the code in `script_drawing.cpp` doesn't even know which one it's running
they all work identically
Same effect for `BMPMASKDRAW`
