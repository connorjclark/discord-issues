I think I've hit on how to make BS Aquamenti possible without tons of hardcoding.

Add Firing Styles: 1 Shot, 1 Shot Fast, 3 Shots Fast, 5 Shots, and 5 Shots Fast

Flag: Morphs

Attribute: Morph Into (0-511)

The Morph Into attribute is different from the Transform attribute which every enemy has. Upon dying, the Aquamentus enemy, should it have the Morph flag, will spawn a new enemy (INTENDED to be used with the Aquamentus class) at its exact coordinates, and that new enemy will start out invincibly-flashing (CSet or flicker depending on the QR). That way, three things happen:
1. It appears to be the same enemy, but you can change its graphics and...
2. Its firing style can be different (as in BS Aquamentus' 2nd (3 Shots Fast) and 3rd phases (5 Shots (Fast?)))
3. Its defenses can be different (as seen in BS Aquamentus' acquired immunity to everything but sword(?) in the second and third phases, but NOT the first)

In essence, a way of linking three Aquamentus enemies to look like they're three phases of one enemy.

why just aquamentus, why not just make this an enemy thing
and since its one-to-one, it should be able to work with standard room spawning mechanics, unlike splitting/tribbling enemies

Sure if you want to
