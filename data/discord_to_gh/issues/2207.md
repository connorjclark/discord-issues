By the powers invested in me as a nitpick elemental I have immediately discovered something incredibly minor! üòà

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:26

oh

it's, uh, not clearing the cursor properly

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:28

trippy
Also noticing the pink selection box seems missized by one pixel on the bottom and right ends. Unless that's a stylistic choice

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:29

al5 rectangles and al4 rectangles are fucking off-by-one from each other
...or, well, technically, most al5 primitives are off by *0.5*, because floating point coords

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:29

Pfahaha emily I am sorry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:30

?

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:30

Edge of screen border is drawn over the large minimap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:30

*OH*
Nice catch!
Minimap layer needs to go above screen info layer

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:31

Good thing it's a trivial fix

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:31

the transparent A5 screen border was very very new
I didn't zoom in the minimap lol

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:31

I like it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:31

and frankly I didn't see it in your screenshot until you pointed it out

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:31

Old one was dithered right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:32

Aye
it dithered at a 1px dither
...and it fucking dithered
over the white X'd out areas too
which bothered the EVERLIVING FUCK out of me
which is why the new transparent border does *NOT* appear when there are white Xs or static
oh, also, turn on static and open the tile editor
err, tile pages, rather
that static is new
and SUPER FANCY

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:34

Did the static used to be bigger?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:34

not sure, feel like no
I had it bigger in one of my earlier screenshots
which was because
how that static worked/works
Previously, it looped through and drew every pixel to a random grayscale color (it had a full cset of grayscale to use)
...trying to do this in AL5, resulted in getting MAYBE 0.5 FPS?
so, that was a REALLY bad idea

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:36

Ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:36

I tried making it twice the pixel size, that helped, unless you went to a page that was all static
quad the pixel size fixed the lag, but looked AWFUL
so, I was at a conundrum
and then genius struck

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:36

So you used a fixed pattern?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:36

yesno?

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:36

lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:36

The first time the tile editor static is drawn each launch
it creates a 1024x1024 A5 bitmap
and colors every single pixel to a random grayscale color (0-255)
then, for each static tile it needs to draw, it grabs a random section of that bitmap and uses it

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:37

Yup, that'd do it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:38

tiles in those pages are 32x32, so a random 32x32 square from a 1024x1024 bitmap, almost 1mil possible choices
and the bitmap regens every launch randomly
so, it is SUPER effectively random
and you would NEVER be able to tell
and it runs *smooooooth* fps
though you may lag spike for JUUUST a moment when it generates the bitmap that one time per launch
....I uh, may have accidentally had it at one point generating that bitmap *every frame*
and uh

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:39

oof

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:39

that very nearly crashed my pc
ctrl+alt+delete barely saved it

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:39

So is the static different in the tile pages vs Favorite Combos?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:39

favorite combos area, and the X/static on the minimap in the main view, are still A4
haven't gotten to those yet

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:39

Gotcha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:40

If you want a good visual of what's A5
go to `zquest.cfg`

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:40

I wanna say it feels like those are animating slower

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:40

under the `[zquest]` header
and add `devmode = 42`
this will give you the magic red vision of A5 stuff

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:40

Nifty

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:40

and, the bar area here between the right of the main menu and the compact button?
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1080601946345439382/1080605599760388188/image.png?ex=65e8e2e3&is=65d66de3&hm=5d808f830d89aa8ce46a5e41f23c51f13f6ec8cf09a682f511a84cdce813fabf&)
If you Ctrl+Click that bar area with that config set, it will *toggle* the red vision

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:41

Doubly nifty
Would it be possible to halve the framerate on the A5 static?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:41

figured making this debug stuff config based would be good so I don't need to compile special builds, or need to remember to turn it off before posting a nightly
uhh,
it changes every time the dialog refreshes

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:42

Oh
So it's not actually capped to any framerate

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:42

so, I could like, slow the fps of the dialog artificially
but yeah

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:43

Well I could just not use static mode

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:43

and capping it to one isn't necessarily easy, as it's not in a real dialog, so I can't just shove a vsync proc in
I mean yeah
not using static mode is generally a good idea
I do prefer the new static to the old static, myself.... but both are still godawful to look at and I don't understand why people use it

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:43

I think the A4 tile editor was also lagging the editor slightly. Looking back and forth between them, A5 gives me a headache, A4 does not. Could also be because I'm sick

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:44

(replying to @ Moosh "I think the A4 tile editor wa‚Ä¶"): I mean, one of the things I would hope A5 upgrades give is better performance
so this makes total sense
Pretty sure all of the tile pages except the tiles themselves is A5
(Did just get tile drawing done, but, didn't revisit that dialog since)

=== @ P-Tux7 03/01/2023 21:52

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Previously, it looped through‚Ä¶"): a full cset wasted on this?!? gdi phantom menace

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:53

hmm, I feel like it couldn't actually be a full cset

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:53

Nah it wasn't a full cset

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:53

it had a good chunk though
more than I expected
...would have to dig through now-deleted code to find the number, and that's tedious enough to not care

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:55

Sorry for using this as a dumping ground for general A5 reactions, but these water combos seem to be animating slower

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:55

Show FPS?
(turn off static, lol?)

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:56

Sitting at around 20. So yeah that'd do it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:56

also
(replying to @ Moosh "Sorry for using this as a dum‚Ä¶"): don't be sorry

I literally renamed the channel to that before you said that lol
frankly easier to have the things that are all related together in a case like this

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:58

Seems to be the same with static off
Jumping between 20 and 30

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:58

I'm apparently holding a solid 30
hmm
...once I'm done upgrading the whole main dialog, I'll definitely want connor to take a look with whatever fancy shit he did before to check for lag sources

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 21:59

Ah, switching to OpenGL shot it up to 40

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 21:59

how do I change that again

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 22:00

ZLaunch option

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 22:00

oh, that's still a thing
thought that changed at some point
pretty solid 40-41 opengl

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 22:01

Does ZQ not have a target framerate? Just runs as fast as it can?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 22:01

I, uh
am not sure about the main screen honestly
Dialogs with animations in them use a vsync proc, which manually clocks itself using system clock cycles, approximating 60FPS
so, combo editor preview, player sprite previews, etc, target 60
the main window I honestly have no clue
The *render system*, has a target, but it skips it to force redraws at certain points
ex. open/close dialogs tend to force re-render instantly, or things like mouse interaction redraws like a button depressing- those do so to feel responsive
the animation rate of combos in the main window, I have no idea.
...I, uh, don't see anything managing it
...oh

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 22:05

The build I did my palette stuff in was running at 60 looks like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 22:05

also the function that is used to approximate that FPS is not the main render function
which, I suppose makes sense
ah,
that function is using an A4 timer set to 60BPS
pahaha, and a 1BPS timer to check the FPS
makes sense
so the question is is it lagging, or is something oddly holding it back?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 22:14

...surprised I caught this before you

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1080601946345439382/1080614042990809098/image.png?ex=65e8eac0&is=65d675c0&hm=6b0c42a0f00f5d4f1cd8703dc366808d3284e1ec3cae9343acb60ab5f9ba16bb&)
the fucking
gridlines
are also
....

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 22:16

Oh!
Yeah I got distracted by this whole lag situation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 22:16

also I think the pink highlight is correct, and the white one is the off one?
ohhhh I immediately note a problem, most of the minimap stuff is A4 still, oof
gotta a5 it up to move it up layers

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 22:17

I think it started with the A5 render tree stuff. 2023-02-23 runs at 60.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 22:18


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1080601946345439382/1080615051553161246/image.png?ex=65e8ebb1&is=65d676b1&hm=1bca70efe330cce88f220288a7b247b97285c1f82b57c5939a10dce84497b904&)
that uh, times pretty accurately

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 22:20

Indeed FPS in that build dropped to 40. Though also ZLaunch was broken so IDK how to toggle OpenGL. Will have to look up the config I guess

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 22:22

Yup, still screwy with OpenGL. So that's one part of the mystery solved

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 22:34

So, upgrading the minimap
```cpp
if(InvalidStatic)
{
    for(int32_t dy=0; dy<sqr.h; dy++)
    {
        for(int32_t dx=0; dx<sqr.w; dx++)
        {
            menu1->line[dy+sqr.y][dx+sqr.x]=vc((((zc_oldrand()%100)/50)?0:8)+(((zc_oldrand()%100)/50)?0:7));
        }
    }
}
else
{
    int32_t offs = 2*(sqr.w/9);
    draw_x(menu1, sqr.x+offs, sqr.y+offs, sqr.x+sqr.w-1-offs, sqr.y+sqr.h-1-offs, vc(15));
}
```
^ This is the old code for invalid
The new code in the minimap?```cpp
al5_invalid(sqr.x,sqr.y,sqr.w,sqr.h);```

Opinions on the sides to the Xs on the zoomed map?
(it's literally a bool toggle, so)

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 23:16

What's it look like in expanded mode?

also it's new static, obviously

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 23:17

I do think the expanded one is a little too big but I'm also not who this feature's for

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/01/2023 23:18

(replying to @ Moosh "I do think the expanded one i‚Ä¶"): It can easily be made smaller, but, to be both using expanded mode and need zooming on the map? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è might be a while before I get enough useful feedback one way or the other

=== @ Moosh 03/01/2023 23:18

yeahhh

nooooooooo I haven't what the fuuuuuuuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 05:40

pffft
fucking
I hate `scare_mouse()`
easy fix

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 05:41

scare_mouse() did that? Because I'd be fucking frightened too ü§£

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 05:41

so, `scare_mouse()` does some bitmap shit to make the mouse draw not interfere with your draws
and then `unscare_mouse()` undoes that shit
....what happens when you accidentally fuck with the bitmaps wrong in between those calls?
Woo!

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 05:42

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 05:42

the fun thing is, that's A4 shit
so anything that's pure A5, like menus, can uh, just not
the calls are still kinda spread fucking everywhere though
Anyway, in other news
when you try to set something true
it helps to make sure something else isn't resetting it instantly to false!

woo, menus working in ZC again even at weird stretches

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)  Heads up, the new nightly still has these artifacts and I've realized they seem to happen specifically on OpenGL. Also there seems to be some comically long delays when confirming certain dialogs. For instance apply new bugfixes when loading a tileset

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 09:28

like how it's gone from minor graphical stuff to "OpenGL performs a little better" to "Oh no, actually OpenGL is completely fucked"

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 09:30

Yeah those dialogs are basically instant on Direct3D but no joke take like 20 seconds on OpenGL. Unsure if it's the dialog itself or the screen failing to update

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 09:35

Seems to be just the screen. Having inconsistent results. It's hard to tell when the button actually registers being pressed when it doesn't update

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 09:45

Seems this one's still kicking around too. I left ZQuest idling, Direct3D this time, and came back to no minimap

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 10:47

And one more fun thing. The palette import dialog seems to not show up, but if I press keyboard keys to navigate around in it (down, down, enter for cset 2) it still seems to function

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 20:55

fucking
why
(replying to @ Moosh "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)  Heads‚Ä¶"): I need to know how to reproduce this
because it does not happen for me anymore
It's probably the same issue I fixed, just somewhere else
and I need to know where to look

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 20:56

Was happening basically everywhere for me. Hopefully I just downloaded the wrong build or something? üò¨

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 20:57

In the prior build, it happened on hovering over the main menu
that... does not seem to happen in latest

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 20:58

Yeah it was way more than that. Using any popup dialog would display the artifacts. Notably the ones when loading an older tileset

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 20:58

The thing is once you do whatever triggers it
it corrupts a bunch of shit

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 20:59

Ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:00

I just ran the rule fix popups on launch and had no issue
...and on loading a quest post launch
so it's not those

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 21:00

And you launched it in OpenGL?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:00

ye
Enable the dev colors, `devmode = 42` in zquest.cfg

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 21:01

okay so I goofed something. Will check when I'm at my computer

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:01

it's almost something A4 triggering it
so, with dev colors on, red stuff should be mostly safe
(mostly)
...frankly it feels like you're on the build prior to latest or something
and I would absolutely pray that's the issue

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 21:40

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:40

it's saving
you have autosave on by chance?
I don't, so saving wouldn't have happened for me randomly

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 21:41

That says loading quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:41

err, huh
they are both the same box that opens

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 21:41

It's an artifact from when it first loads up the quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:41

...but loading wasn't triggering it for me

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 21:42

Hadn't popped up a save dialog at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:42

...yeah, loading does nothing wrong for me

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 21:42

Another thought, are you testing on x86 or x64?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:43

x64

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 21:43

I always test on x86

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:43

I never test x86

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 21:43

Will try and see if that makes the difference

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:43

because that would require setting up a whole second buildchain

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 21:45

It sure is not making a difference
Is it possible something just went bad with the build you posted?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 21:46

it fucks up on saving for me though
just not loading

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 23:04

Here's another fucky one in the palette editor. Cursor position is incorrect and the selection goes below the bottom of the level palette space
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1080601946345439382/1080989140436406292/image.png?ex=65ea4816&is=65d7d316&hm=333647214788119243088252a5daa73da6496ef53a65e608a02c2b2f33cbb7b9&)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 23:05

aaaah
(I made the palette bigger, and missed a hardcoded height value somewhere)
(will be 1line)

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 23:06

Snapshot removed the cursor but I was clicking the lowest "4" when it selected down there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 23:06

yeah, I recreated it in 2 seconds
it's just a hardcoded height value somewhere
that needs to change from `12` to `h`

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 23:12

(replying to @ Moosh "And one more fun thing. The p‚Ä¶"): back to this one, doing some fiddling around, I got the palette import dialog to show up but it's behind the palette window and I can't click anything on it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 23:13

oh...that probably needs a popup call
thought I got most of them, but forgot palette import

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 23:18


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1080601946345439382/1080992529966710885/image.png?ex=65ea4b3f&is=65d7d63f&hm=a493b71708a2472d9971bcf3b26c7d8ddebc79b8b92d1404110951793caa5b5e&)
fucking a5-ified
not sure what exactly about that was corrupting shit
probably something scare_mouse related
but a5ing it fixed the issues
oh, and uh
it PROBABLY had something to do with
the fact that it wasn't *CLOSING* the box when it was done sometimes
it just.... drew over it.
so, added closes to those spots too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 23:40

(replying to @ Moosh "back to this one, doing some‚Ä¶"): how.... did you even get it to pop up

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 23:41

I don't know

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 23:41

this window does some SERIOUS palette hacks

=== @ Moosh 03/02/2023 23:41

I was tabbing between the palette editor and Select Level and then suddenly it showed up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 23:41


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1080601946345439382/1080998425300058142/image.png?ex=65ea50bc&is=65d7dbbc&hm=49ed0c1e02f654785b1d4bb19c3ea04ff58ad6a3fc9943ec9689edea77855bce&)
sooo yeah... I feel like I need to fully rewrite this dialog
to use pure a5
for it to work at all
...I hate everything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 23:44

uhg
except it can't be *pure* a5
because it needs to be indexed palette bullshit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 23:47

uhhhh
I said No to something when loading the quest
and it did this
fun

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/02/2023 23:52

AAAH
it was opening a box while a box was already open
and not accounting for that
so, `box_active` is now an `int`, counting the number of active boxes- instead of just a `bool`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/03/2023 14:32

k, so most of this should be cleaned up in latest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2023 22:53

I'm gonna just close this, it's only open for noting FPS issues, which I'm certain I can remember, and won't be worked on for a whiile anyway
everything else reported here was fixed, so
