Items will rest atop slopes happily, but will suddenly fall through the slope when the player is vertically above the slope. (Sideview, fallthrough-able horizontal slopes)

uh
items rest atop slopes?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/15/2024 00:42

...an item was resting on a slope at some point...
....but now I can't recreate it....

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/15/2024 00:43

nothing in the code suggests they can do that
items don't call any of the slope functions

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/15/2024 00:54

I'm very confused
...though can simply change this to "let items rest on slopes plz"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2024 07:08

it'd probably be really simple to add but I'm drained of all the tiny little nuances from trying to polish slopes a bit
like probably an "onplatform" or something for items

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/17/2024 07:09

I doubt people use slopes enough for the lack of a compat QR to be an issue assuming this is backported to 2.55
cause like I'm not sure *how* you'd add compat QRs to 2.55 at this rate?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/17/2024 07:16

not simply, so lets not. changing the qst format in 2.55 is tricky given 3.0 exists
I think you are right about a compat qr not being necessary at this stage for slopes.

replay version has the same problem, but not as serious
