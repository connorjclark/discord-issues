When moving the mouse outside the window, the cursor continues displaying at the edge of the window @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) A5 issue

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 08/12/2022 03:07

It also moves slightly less smoothly than the regular windows mouse; I really don't like how A5 is handling the mouse compared to A4

(sorry if I've been really unhelpful with this; I wouldn't know where to start v.v)

Allegro legacy doesn't do hardware mouse (yet)
I've talked about this elsewhere. Somewhere

oh deeeeedeeeeee
I has a present for you

notice notably that the mouse cursor is not visible on the left edge of the screen here
....this is NOT using an actual hardware cursor, which would be better
but, I made an ALLEGRO_EVENT_QUEUE listening for the A5 events 'mouse leave display' and 'mouse enter display'
....and then use those events to call the *A4* function `show_mouse(NULL)`/`show_mouse(screen)` to show/hide it.
```cpp
static ALLEGRO_EVENT_QUEUE* evq = nullptr;
void init_mouse_events()
{
    if(!evq)
    {
        evq = al_create_event_queue();
        al_register_event_source(evq, al_get_mouse_event_source());
    }
}
void update_mouse_events()
{
    if(evq)
    {
        ALLEGRO_EVENT event;
        while(al_get_next_event(evq, &event))
        {
            switch(event.type)
            {
                case ALLEGRO_EVENT_MOUSE_ENTER_DISPLAY:
                {
                    show_mouse(screen);
                    break;
                }
                case ALLEGRO_EVENT_MOUSE_LEAVE_DISPLAY:
                {
                    show_mouse(NULL);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
void destroy_mouse_events()
{
    if(evq)
    {
        al_destroy_event_queue(evq);
        evq = nullptr;
    }
}```
looks about like it used to look before the A5 update
not sure what changed that made this NOT be happening, or more accurately, what the fuck was doing this for us before, but, this should patch it

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) any opinions on this?
hardware cursor seems obviously preferable, but, this was bothersome enough to be worth investing in a solution to last us until that's an option

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/19/2022 08:47

You should be able to add handling for the events in a5_mouse.c. I assume you made a new thread for the code you shared above?
Oh, no

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/19/2022 08:47

noope, I tacked it in `update_hw_screen()` since that's called everywhere

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/19/2022 08:47

Yeah this thing coukd just go there in the middle thread I think
It's something allegro legacy should be doing anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/19/2022 08:48

it should, yeah
we didn't need this code in A4, so, clearly something is missing to do this for you
thankfully band-aids don't need to be pretty, and hopefully we can use a hardware cursor sooner rather than later

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/19/2022 08:50

gonna push a nightly, did a few fixes today, and a couple are graphical ones that just IRK people, so nice to push a fix for quickly.

Thank you
