When a block puzzle involves moving blocks on top of multiple Block Trigger (66) Flags, normally you need to push blocks on all of them. In 100, secrets are triggered as soon as you cover *one*.

The door at the bottom (Secret Flag 16) was opened after moving just one block onto a Block Trigger

Sorry. This was probably a result of me asking for switchhooked pushblocks (if you set them to have the switch hookable attribute) to depress block triggers if you swap them onto one

Like the diamonds in Oracle of Ages
There's also a setting on the dedicated Switch Hook Blocks to let them depress block triggers even if the block itself is unpushable, much like those diaminds.

err, no there isn't

Bah dammit
It's checking one fewer layer than it should for triggers because I have a `<` not `<=`
...and I'm guessing you have only layer 0 set to work, so it checks *no* layers, and thus assumes it found them all...
