An itemclass for boots that block conveyor belts and wind so that they don't conflict with the Z2-style normal Boots that block damage from combos when you want to have only one or the other. Requires a QR to remove the behaviour where normal Boots items can have the Heavy flag and all your owned Boots are checked.

Ideally, Conveyors would also get a field where the level of Iron Boots needed to nullify their effects is input.
