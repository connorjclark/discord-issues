Thinking ahead of a useful feature, there is a curiosity on how Candles set the step speed of the created flames, how hardcoded of a value this is, and if this could be changed so an Attribute of Candle Items is the Step Speed of Candle Flames.
This addition would likely need to include a QR to support current "hardcoded" Candle Flame step speed.
Some advantages to freeing up this hardcoded value is being able to create Candles with no range (sort of like the LttP Lantern flames), or have higher leveled candles shoot flames further.

Shouldn't need a QR, it seems
there's nothing fancy hardcoded about the candle
it just sets the step speed to 50 in the constructor
so, instead, it can set it to an attribute
(which will default to 50)

excellent... do any other weapons have hardcoded step speeds?
-sword beams? (though idk if we're outta attributes for those)
-the wand?
-boomerangs?
-the whistle whirlwind?
-the hooks? (though this could get messy if they don't already)
i'll check the item editor tomorrow
