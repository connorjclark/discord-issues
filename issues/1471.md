ZC only uses the first enemy in the list (#-wise?) when checking what enemy to spawn in X Room Type. Having this as a flag for all 512 enemies is useless and takes away from more valuable flags.
Therefore, I propose this be set to miscQData a la Misc. Audio or Misc. Sprites with a dropdown like those, and whenever loading a quest in the player or editor, the first enemy to bear a specific flag is set as the requisite enemy for that Room Type, and all other enemies with that flag are discarded.

Probably make it a dialog accessed from the Misc. Data menu or something that re-uses the same template as the Misc. SFX/Misc. Sprites dialogs.

not a bad idea

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 04:01

the only issue i can foresee is if these properties of an enemy are somehow checkable by scripts, and mitsukara et al used them as "free custom flags" for every enemy past the first (the actual used roomtype one)
god bless her she's done that that if it was allowed, i'm sure of it

Of note for the record
script changes to `miscQdata` do not save between save/quit
script changes to `gamedata` *do*
as `gamedata` literally *is* the save file

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 06:28

Hmm
Does it increase the save file size even when unchanged by scripts?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/18/2022 06:30

If so, I think it should be left as miscQdata so it doesn't. If a permanent change to it in the save file is needed (a difficulty mode where all Zoras change to something else et al), it can merely be one saved variable that triggers the miscQdata change upon loading the game

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2022 06:35

I mean
it would increase the size by 2 bytes per enemy type
absolutely negligible
it would take 500 enemy types to convert to take 1kb
and there's, what? Zora, Rocks, Ghini, Armos?
oh, no, the different trap types
I see
there's 13
so 26 bytes
...that's literally nothing.

Well then
(meta) thread name was changed: Conversion of Most Enemy Spawn Flags into GameData
