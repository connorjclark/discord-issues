So I'm moving maps around in a 119 qest, meaning I export them and then import them elsewhere. For some reason, one of the maps is producing an error and not importing.
I get the following extra text boxes when it goes wrong.

This is the map that is failing to import.

What's funny, is that other maps are importing fine, no extra text boxes. I wonder if it has to do with the size of the map / placement of unused screens.
For example, this map does import fine.

Leaning toward map size, found another one that didn't import.

Wonder if there needs to be some number of screens or screen data.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/19/2023 03:54

The version being saved to this files is the ZELDA_VERSION (always 0x255), but it should have been the map version number. In practice this still works out because ZELDA_VERSION is so much larger than what the current map version is, so all the right data is read.

This is what returns the "Invalid version" error:

https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/60e9d9f4173dddcf177b5c7f766406e282aefed4/src/zq/zq_class.cpp#L818-L823
It's checking if the first screen is valid. So if the result of the copy makes the first screen remain or become not initialized, it's considered an error. This is a bug.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/19/2023 04:11

I think this check can just be removed.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/19/2023 04:13

The assumption here seems that if the first screen is invalid (cuz who would skip it, eh?) then the user is importing an empty map (what??) and it then prompts you if you wanna clear it (except... it only says OK). then it clears it explicitly.
so uhhh, just all seems very confused and wrong, so I'll delete it.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/19/2023 04:17

even more confusing, it wasn't checking if a screen was valid but... `screens[0].valid&mVERSION`

(yes, mapscr valid byte is set to ZELDA_VERSION, not a boolean....)

it was doing a bitwise check on what version the first screen was _made in_
make zero sense

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/19/2023 04:19

no, not what version, but clearing a map sets this to a special value...

```
#define mVALID          0x01
#define mVERSION        0x80
```

Clearing a screen sets to mVERSION. where otherwise it's just one.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/19/2023 06:25

Will push fix tomorrow, when main branch is passing again. For now @ HeroOfFireZC just...don't clear the first screen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/19/2023 17:05

Fixed next nightly.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 01:25

@ HeroOfFireZC just wanna check if you've successfully been able to import maps now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2023 01:30

Marking as fixed
