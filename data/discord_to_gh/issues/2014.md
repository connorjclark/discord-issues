Nov 5 nightly
Linear scaling is on by default, which is better when at non-perfect pixel ratios.  However, now even at perfect pixel ratios (2x,3x,4x) all graphics are fuzzy/blurred when it should be able to evenly place pixels.
This is small mode at 4x:

but the problem applies to large mode and ZC

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 17:10

....what about non-linear scaling?
because there were fuzziness issues at even pixel scales, before that was added.....

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 17:15

At "nearest neighbor" settings things look perfect at 2x/3x/4x to me
ZQ and ZC

anyway, what is it you expect to be done here?
You're pointing out an oddity with linear scaling but like
what are you asking of us as a bug report

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 17:23

Linear scaling at perfect 2x/3x/4x scales should render sharply, basically, especially if it's the default scaling mode going forward.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 17:24

I don't know if that's a thing that is possible
I'll just @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) on this one

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 17:26

I understand that at anything outside of whole integer scales, linear scaling will be blurry because that's just how it works, but this is a really important visual thing for a pixel/retro game engine I think

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:05

in large mode at 1x, it looks fine
I can't test 2x, as that's bigger than my monitor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:07

....small mode 2x, I see what you mean
but I don't see any way to fix this
so I don't know what you want us to do
people apparently preferred this to not this
which is why it was made default

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:09

May be possible to change dynamically, I'll check later

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:10

going to pull @ Russ @ vlamart in here given they were part of the previous thread

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:17

@ mitchfork how is fullscreen?

=== @ vlamart 11/09/2022 20:17

Okay, I see what you mean. 1x is crisp, any bigger though is too big for my monitor, but fullscreen is fuzzy.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:17

(replying to @ vlamart "Okay, I see what you mean. 1x…"): "real" fullscreen or "maximized window to biggest"?

=== @ vlamart 11/09/2022 20:18

`Etc.->Fullscreen`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:18

ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:18

see
for me
etc->fullscreen
crashes
oh wait
that's only in small mode

=== @ vlamart 11/09/2022 20:19

I'm using large

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:19

in large mode, fullscreen seems a lot more crisp than maximizing
but still not as crisp as 1x windowed
(not that I would *EVER* use fullscreen
(because opening it in fullscreen fucks up *every other open window on my pc*)

=== @ vlamart 11/09/2022 20:20

For me, maximizing is crisper at the expense the scaling is off, the some n look like r stuff
I don't ever use fullscreen or any bigger than the default 1x size either 🤷‍♀️

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:21

yeah, large mode 1x is plenty big on my monitor
small mode would be 3x for me though
and that looks like shit with linear mode

left is linear, right is old

=== @ vlamart 11/09/2022 20:23

Right looks better to me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:23

by far, yes
I'm very curious what russ thinks of this
given he said:
> I can drag it to whatever weird size I want and I'm not noticing any particular egregious distortion, be it on the sprites or on allegro text

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:25

and also @ vlamart
you previously said:
> Looks *much* better
...about the *left* image
so like
🤷‍♀️

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:26

I think they might have been looking at the ratios of some pixel art.
Not so much the gui.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 20:27

I mean, the images I just compared above are showcasing the pixel art
being blurry and garbage
I'm just a bit curious how the new way is both much better AND much worse simultaneously, lol

=== @ vlamart 11/09/2022 20:28

Oh, I was looking at `File, Quest, Edit`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:28

The real fix here....is to separate the GUI drawing from the pixel art drawing, and blit scale the latter to match the available space (but only int ratios, i guess?). It's just a big mess to untangle the assumed viewport size in some of the code. But to be fair, I never really gave it an attempt...thus all these bandaids thus far.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 20:29

For now we'll try nearest neighbor for integer scaling, linear otherwise.
if even possible

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 20:50

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@ mitchfork how is…"): Fullscreen crashes for me, I don't use it

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 20:59

Yeah to be clear - the old nearest neighbor behavior is really bad (particularly with GUI elements) for non-int ratios, so I agree with the Russ/Vlamart complaints in the old thread.  It just comes with the tradeoff that linear scaling is now blurry for integer ratios.  I think ZC at 1280x960 (2x) is a common setting, and ZQ small mode at 3x/4x is also common among the small users so it's a pretty rough tradeoff
I think Connor's solution seems good if it's able to work

=== @ Russ 11/09/2022 21:00

Don't suppose ZC's smart enough to switch on the fly based on your resolution

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 21:04

I think that's what Connor is suggesting
Non-int uses your config setting, int uses nearest neighbor always

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 21:05

(replying to @ mitchfork "Non-int uses your config sett…"): Yeah, though may just remove the choice now

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 21:09

I would prefer keeping it because I can see people at non-1080 displays  (laptop monitors) preferring a sharper option for stuff like 1.5x scale, but

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 21:12

Also, it should be ok to do NN for more than just integer scale... Ex

800x600 at 1.5 is a clean 1200x900

So problem is not fractional scaling but when it results in non integer resolution (thus being off by one or two pixel in some direction )

So maybe the fix could be to take that into account when resizing? Idk, something to try

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 21:13

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "The real fix here....is to se…"): Yeah and it's a mess too because the ZC 1x resolution is 640x480 even though the "real game" resolution is 256x224 (or something like that) going through a 2x scale and then having padding added for... reasons? I'm sure the code is hellish here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 21:14

Yeah the doubled up GUI code doesn't help here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:19

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Also, it should be ok to do N…"): Errr no

It's already doing this.

Fine let's just stick to integers 😭

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:20

Perhaps the configuration should be to control whether non integers are allowed for scaling. Which would always use linear interpolation.

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 23:22

what would be the effect of dragging it to a non-integer window size?
in that case

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:35

> non-integer window size

Window size is always an interger, I assume you mean non-integer scale (window size compared to base 640x480). if so:

same as right now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:36

just like, it'd be an option if you wanna maximize screen real estate

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 23:36

I did, I see

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:36

and don't care about the blur
not sure how "round down to nearest integer" will look yet
lotsa letterboxing
and it'll beg the question "what about all this spaaaaace"
which I wish we could fill up with GUI eventually. or more than one screen in zquest 👀
But at its heart, we are still gonna have a 640x480 canvas to work with until some stuff is un-hardcoded

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 23:40

Maybe it should use the base ZCL resolutions (640, 960, 1280, 1600 widths). It would keep consistency with what has been supported over the program lifespan.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 23:41

the zcl resolutions.... are just the integer scales
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "But at its heart, we are stil…"): is the base canvas not 320x240?

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 23:42

Dunno though.  There are a lot of solutions I'm sure.  I'm willing to try out any changes and give feedback

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:42

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "is the base canvas not 320x24…"): Yeah it is, kinda, but....see how zc_scale (or whatever) gets set to 2...
idk
it's all confusing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 23:42

it should be 320x240 base, but the default is 2x

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 23:42

When I set the resolution to 320x240, it results in the GUI being unreadable half size stuff.  This led me to believe that 640x480 was base

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:43

But the screen bitmap is always 640x IIRC (right now).

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/09/2022 23:43

huh
pretty sure that's new as of a5 stuff

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 23:43

plus ZCLauncher doesn't even support 320x240 (I usually just edit the cfg but worth noting)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/09/2022 23:44

Yes, it was needed to support arbitrary window resizing... for reasons I can't recall right now. I should look at it again, perhaps it was a mistake.
(replying to @ mitchfork "plus ZCLauncher doesn't even…"): Because it looks _awful_
particularly the allegro ui menu

=== @ mitchfork 11/09/2022 23:44

It does! And on modern displays would be barely playable even if it didn't
Yeah that's what I mean by the GUI

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 01:32

Next nightly will round down to nearest integer by default. Controlled by `scaling_force_integer`.

=== @ mitchfork 11/10/2022 01:35

I'll test it out!

=== @ mitchfork 11/10/2022 05:10

So I had a chance to try. Unfortunately... I don't think this is the path forward.  It doesn't fix the actual issue that I'm talking about, which is that the default scaling mode is linear, and linear doesn't look right at pure 2x/3x/4x.  So now it's kind of the worst of both worlds, where it's defaulting to linear and also forcing the worst cases for linear scaling

=== @ mitchfork 11/10/2022 05:12

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "For now we'll try nearest nei…"): Was this not feasible? I thought this was the way to go

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 05:17

I did forget to change the default to not linear, so consider that I did. Then what?
I was working on that next

=== @ mitchfork 11/10/2022 05:19

ah, okay, gotcha

=== @ mitchfork 11/10/2022 05:23

then my only suggestion for this feature is a little contradictory but I think is more user-friendly - make it ratchet by half scale instead for ZC. If I launch from Z Launcher this doesn't support 960x720 and 1600x1200.  The 960x720 is an important one because anything sub-1080 is probably going to want to run that, so default settings not supporting it is a miss imo
...also maybe I'm doing it wrong but setting `scaling_force_integer = 0` doesn't seem to disable this for me? It's still forcing 1x or 2x
I'm curious how this will play with Dee's fixes but will try those out when they get bundled together

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2022 10:02

(replying to @ mitchfork "...also maybe I'm doing it wr…"): seems that this wasn't working in ZCL specifically for some indeterminable reason
I've just changed the default configs to `scaling_force_integer = 0`, except ZCL where I removed the config entirely. Same for `scaling_mode`, now defaults to `nn` instead of `linear`, except ZCL which I removed entirely.
Shouldn't make a difference once connor is done with the fancy fancy shit he's doing for upgrading the gui
but, in the meantime, seems like a saner default

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2022 09:34

Rendering refactor just landed, which should handle all this better. Default option is nearest neighbor but is configurable per-application in launcher.
