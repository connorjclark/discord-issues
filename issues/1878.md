Since the combo flags have been rearranged by alphabetical order, I'm sure it has caused quest makers a bit of difficulty finding the flag they want to place as they've been familiar with the numerical order, so how about a button to switch the sorting list from alphabetical or numerical order.

Some lists let you type to search by name, if that helps

I'm still amazed at the fact that despite how "common sense" it is to have them alphabetized, it really does seem to have made a dramatic impact in peoples' abilities to find a flag.  It was just _pure muscle memory_ for years.

But it's still a common sense method that we've moved into, and I'm sure we'll get used to this again soon.

any time you see `(###)` at the end of a list, type a number to search by number

Fair enough.
