If you open Player Data all pickup counter increases on currently owned equipment items will reapply.  Tested with both bombs and arrows

these are how my items are set up.  If you start with the item in inventory, you'll have 4 bomb capacity as normal.  Every time you open Player Data in the cheat menu, the max counter increases by 4 when you return to game

THAT'S SO WEIRD

=== @ mitchfork 11/16/2022 15:43

I'm sure it's something to do with like, making sure if you grant yourself a quiver (or whatever) item via the cheat menu, it'll apply the pickup increases correctly.  It's just not checking if you already have the item in your inventory before accessing the menu

huh
@ mitchfork can you find what version this issue started in?

=== @ mitchfork 11/16/2022 20:17

Sure, as long as it's not ancient. I know it goes back to a110 at least

=== @ mitchfork 11/16/2022 21:28

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ mitchfork can you‚Ä¶"): well, looks like it's exactly a110.  This doesn't happen in a109

Well that certainly looks like it would cause exactly this
who to blame now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2022 21:42

yep, figured
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) what was the reason behind this change?
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/923a1031c97ee7a07b2da692b477fa94f0e33416

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/16/2022 21:45

I think it was related to a difference in "got an item" between original recording and replaying.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2022 21:46

I'll leave this to you to fix so you can make sure it doesn't break your replay stuff then
but this is a problem

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/16/2022 21:46

For a function called reset items it's pretty hard to reason about
Lots of tricky stuff here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2022 21:47

This is used to set the items to the init data items of a quest
which should be used in 2 situations
`1. On starting a new quest`
`2. On using cheats in the Player Data menu`
the latter here is blatantly broken by this change, so

Ah, good, it wasn't needed for anything still. Thanks @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
Should be fixed in next build
