Apparently this does not seem to exist and if this is the case, I and probably several other people are asking for it. Ideally it should work on a per combo basis instead of a universal toggle

(as a bonus, a combo flag for same that responds to all the trigger stuff)

you can make anything function on a per combo basis, you'd just set this flag to be on or off depending on whether you're on a combo with a Script X flag
though yeah it should exist given that it's already a cheat
