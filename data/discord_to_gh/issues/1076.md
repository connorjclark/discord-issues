printf does not appear to read integer args fed into it properly, or at the very least ``weapon->OriginalTile``. It gives a completely incorrect result back.

```
Spear's original tile is set to 20621, as confirmed by Trace(spear->OriginalTile);
printf("Spear OriginalTile: %i", spear->OriginalTile);
Print result: "Spear OriginalTile: 206211.0000"
```

Tested with other numbers
Seems to consistently do it with any number, usually adding another digit to the end.

Presumably `%d` works fine still?
Or does that also give issues

=== @ Orithan 10/04/2021 05:52

Might have to check

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:19

Is `%i` not the same case as `%d`? These are identical in C

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:19

Nope

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:19

i for integer d for decimal (versus hexadecimal)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:19

%i is intended to always be integer
While %f is float

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:20

so is %d
always iteger

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:20

%d automatically chooses %i or %f here

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:20

oh
err
that's nonstandard

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:20

If the value has a non-0 decimal portion
Aye
I believe that's how std did it
I just ported the behavior

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:20

and may break older quests?
Did it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:21

I recall following it very specifically

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:23

```else if(chr == 'i') return MF_INT;
    else if(chr == 'f') return MF_FLOAT;
    else if(chr == 'd') return MF_NUM;```
Moses..nani.
Well at least *I* didn't do that.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:24

Personally, I like the option, it makes sense with ZScripts odd numbers

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:24

I would have made `i` and `d` the same.If you want `f` use `f`
I suppose
it is just bizarre when you are used to real printf.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 08:24

Aye, certainly
At least I added mindigits (with a rule for old printf for old script preservation)
Not having `%03d` was painful

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/04/2021 08:26

Sure
I don't mind new stuff. You know that.
That's a useful addition.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 09:57

pffffft
@ Orithan
this bug is on you

=== @ Orithan 10/04/2021 09:57

?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 09:58

try running this:
```cpp
printf("Spear OriginalTile: %i", spear->OriginalTile);
TraceS("FooBar\n");```
and you might notice what's happening
and, this, in contrast.
```cpp
printf("Spear OriginalTile: %i\n", spear->OriginalTile);
TraceS("FooBar\n");```

(meta) thread name was changed: ❌🔒Broken printf() number read

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:42

(Did you notice the issue?)
(To spell it out, you didn't have a newline at the end of your string)
(so it was tracing your number exactly correctly)
(but then, the next thing you traced, appeared on the same line, thus making it look wrong)

=== @ Orithan 10/07/2021 23:58

I was busy doing other things
