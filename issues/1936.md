=== @ mitchfork 10/02/2022 04:54

std_constants shows the SFI_ constants.  These don't appear to match what ZC is tracing for their value.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 04:55

what's wrong?

=== @ mitchfork 10/02/2022 04:56

I have a screen set up with the "Hold Up Item" screen flag.  If I do `TraceToBase(Screen->Flags[SF_ITEMS],16,1);`, I expect to get 0x0001
Instead I get 0x0040
this is causing scripts that detect these flags not to work properly
This is tested on the latest nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 05:00

what happens if you just `Trace()` instead of `TraceToBase`
and really, I need more details
can you provide a test quest/script that shows the problem?

=== @ mitchfork 10/02/2022 05:02

trace returns 64 with just "Hold Up Item" set
yeah, I can probably rig something up quickly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 05:03

and, importantly
try
`TraceB(ScreenFlag(SF_ITEMS,SFI_HOLDUP));`

=== @ mitchfork 10/02/2022 05:05

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "`TraceB(ScreenFlag(SF_ITEMS,S…"): this traces false, putting together an example quest

=== @ mitchfork 10/02/2022 05:09

I've set this up so that the FFC script on screen is tracing out the screen flags, and also a bool check on SFI_HOLDUP.  Screen 00 is set with "Hold Up Item" checked only
script is just in the buffer

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 05:13

opening that quest prints:```
64.0000
false```for you?
because I get
```
1.0000
true```

=== @ mitchfork 10/02/2022 05:15

.... yes.

what the hell

=== @ mitchfork 10/02/2022 05:19

I'm using the 64-bit program? I guess?
That's the only thing I could think of being different here.  It couldn't even be a bad quest/script rule because it'd at least be the same

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 05:21

(replying to @ mitchfork "I'm using the 64-bit program?…"): so am I
though I'm not using the latest nightly
I'm using a build I'm working on stuff on myself
but nothing related to screen flags should have changed

=== @ mitchfork 10/02/2022 05:22

For the record - I'm using a109 to dev in currently and that's where I found this.  I tested/confirmed in latest nightly just to make sure it hadn't already been fixed.  So it's happening across multiple versions for me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 05:22

huh??

=== @ mitchfork 10/02/2022 05:23

yup

=== @ mitchfork 10/02/2022 14:30

Additional info, I asked tacochopper to test this file and he got the same debugger output as me (64, false)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 19:06

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) any chance you tested in debug mode or did you build as release mode? Small chance there could be a difference...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 19:26

on mac, I see 1.0 for both debug and release modes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/02/2022 19:37

I tested in debug, to be fair

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/02/2022 19:49

Give it a shot in release, I recall seeing a difference on windows once that actually mattered 👀
msvc keeps you on your toes
And if that is the case, then `RelWithDebInfo` may be a good way to investigate/step thru the code.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2022 03:54

@ mitchfork try the new nightly?

=== @ mitchfork 10/03/2022 04:02

Still ```
64.0000
false```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 15:05

@ mitchfork the only thing I can think of
....hmm, I was about to say you're using an outdated std_zh
but as I typed that I realized that no, then it would be broken for me too

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1025994214678483034/1029047118800892006/unknown.png?ex=65e5e34f&is=65d36e4f&hm=0595fbf07189037154ddfd9f9311f6f2f4ba9955967c6e394fbf997ae6bd750b&)
I get this
every time

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 15:13

I can try on the latest nightly later on in the day to see if it's still there, but it's just using the STD bundled in the release

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 15:15

yeah
I don't understand what's wrong here
because like
I'm not recompiling the scripts
I'm not even saving the quest

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 15:16

Yeah, that's true. So whatever STD I'm using is compiled in

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 15:18

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Give it a shot in release, I…"): did you try this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 15:21

yes
it works fine in release or debug
in multiple builds now
I cannot replicate this *at all*

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 15:24

Bizarre

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 15:24

like, legitimately, if this were a report from some rando new account, I might think they were trolling me
that's how baffling this is
the bug you are reporting seems to simply not exist

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 15:25

Like I said, I will test. But I've had at least one person on my quest dev teams reporting the same thing, on the original version I reported it at least

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 15:26

but like
it's not just that
(replying to @ mitchfork "Still ```
64.0000
false```"): this right here
you got it again
in a version I tested
that worked fine for me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 15:27

PFFFT and I just rainbow death crashed
good to know that's still around

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 15:31

WOW
rainbow death crashed and then pc hard froze
for like
5 minutes before ctrl+alt+del took

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 15:41

Somehow I've never seen rainbow death crash
But am aware of it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 15:41

I saw it very rarely
though who knows, new graphics card, maybe I'll be seeing it more now

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 15:44

http://puu.sh/JoGMN/259436b34a.png
yup, still in 10-08 nightly
didn't open in ZQ or recompile

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 15:45

did you download the quest file from discord?

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 15:47

yes
I just tried recompiling/resaving, same result

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 15:52

just bizarre

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:02

I am baffled

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:04

I asked Sheik to test this earlier and he got the same thing I did, 64 false. Maybe another dev can try it to see what they print

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:04

What's your OS?

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:06

Windows 10, running the 64 bit ZC exe

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:07

Home or Pro

try this build
and that quest is just the same one, but resaved on my pc in this exact build

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:09

Sure, let me get home to check on that too. I'm not sure what exact version I'm running

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:10

also thank you @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) for your recent optimizations, they reduced zquest.exe to a size where I can send it in discord again

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:24

sorry to say but we are still at ```FFC script 1 (printHoldUp): 64.0000
FFC script 1 (printHoldUp): false```
running Windows 10 Home 21H2

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:26

OK so
I have no fucking idea why it is broken for you and not me
I have no clue what could possibly cause that
But I have a *theory* as to what is wrong
and
well

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1025994214678483034/1029112878785114122/zelda.exe?ex=65e6208e&is=65d3ab8e&hm=4c2c511880ae605e128439cae74c052b47ff7fbc1cdf9a4d5567bbc734b54ef9&
please for the love of god
tell me this fixes it
@ mitchfork

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:28

http://puu.sh/JoHDq/474fd611c8.png
!!!!!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:29

ok
this
this
fucking
I know exactly what your computer was doing
vs what mine was doing
I have  *NO CLUE WHY*
Also, there were no changes
to this code
since like
2.50.2
so
this broke *literally out of nowhere*

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:30

any way to explain it or is it just too esoteric

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:30

```cpp
f = ornextflag(m->flags3&1)  | ornextflag(m->flags7&4)  | ornextflag(m->flags8&0x40)  | ornextflag(m->flags8&0x80)  | ornextflag(m->flags9&0x01)  | ornextflag(m->flags9&0x02)  | ornextflag(m->flags9&0x04);```
This is how it was parsing the flags
it calls that function
repeatedly
and bitwise-OR's the return
Your computer
was calling the functions in reverse order instead of forwards order
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) any idea why that would happen?

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:31

Endianness????? No clue if that's relevant whatsoever but it's what come to mind

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:31

(replying to @ mitchfork "Endianness????? No clue if th…"): ...?

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:32

like, big-endian or little-endian.  No way that's relevant.  All Windows computers should be little-endian.  It's like, set hardware architecture

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:33

well 🤷‍♀️
why was your pc doing that then

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:33

beats me lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:33

now here's the fun thing
I fixed this for all the places that were using the `ornextflag` bullshit
but, who the fuck knows what other bugs this could cause????
if it just.... decides to parse expressions backwards
frankly, if it were to do that everywhere, I have no idea how it wouldn't just crash immediately
unless it's only bitwise operators
but frankly like
I don't know how this wouldn't be *part of the .exe*
the same exe should run the same way
regardless

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:39

would love to know if connor has any idea at all how this is even possible

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:44

So it was storing the first binary bit in the last place? in this case since SFI_ constants max out at `01111111`, it was somehow writing what should be `00000001` to `01000000`?
jeez

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:44

here's the thing
it was calling the function 7 times
the first call sets the far-right bit
the second call sets the next bit left
etc

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:45

aahhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:45

there are 7 item flags
so only the first 7 bits are used

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 19:45

yeah that makes sense why reversing the order would do that then I guess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 19:45

and reversing the order of the function calls....
That's also the only way I realized what was wrong
I went `Wait, there's 7 flags there, and 1<<6 is 0x40`
since the value was not random every time you launched, it wasn't bad memory access
it had to be something that would consistently give EXACTLY 0x40

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 22:49

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "```cpp
f = ornextflag(m->flag…"): The exact order of such expressions is unspecified.

https://stackoverflow.com/a/9818176/2788187
I'd expect whatever order to be consistent given the same exe, though, so that's still unclear to me.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 22:51

Yeah, exactly. Would that not be part of the compiling process?
Though to be frank, why the fuck is that unspecified? That seems like an awful decision!
And, what the fuck broke this to begin with?
These were like that unchanged for *over a decade*

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 22:56

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Yeah, exactly. Would that not…"): That's just the most sane way to think of how compilers could differ/interpret this.

Maybe they literally do something at runtime based on a cpu feature detection to determine the "best" execution order
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "And, what the fuck broke this…"): Could have just been a compiler upgrade.
Only way to know for sure would be if mitchfork started checking tons of old releases

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 22:58

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Though to be frank, why the f…"): because being able to assume no data dependencies within an expression is a useful thing for optimization

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/10/2022 23:00

i bet there's some compiler warning that yells if you do this with non-const functions

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 23:03

I know this bug didn't exist around ~a100 for me. Not sure when in between it broke. Could be Allegro5 related?  Just spitballing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 23:04

Hmm, when was the C++ upgrade in alpha numbers? That was like last August
A97 apparently

=== @ mitchfork 10/10/2022 23:16

Mm, that would have been around the time I got too busy to dev anymore. So possibly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/10/2022 23:21

so, that would be when we stopped using C++03.
