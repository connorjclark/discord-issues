Volume Control for Media Player in ZQuest please  My streaming friends complained that it blasted their ears

You can just use the volume mixer in windows. Does that work for you?

=== @ NightmareJames 09/14/2022 16:56

How would you do that in a streaming capacity?
When you're streaming over Discord?
Twitch I could Master it over OBS
Not me I'm worried about, it's the people that I'm broadcasting to that are complaining

Volume mixer is independent of output device afaik
you right click on the volume thing to change an application volume level

the most basic sound management tool
for any program

I'm not as familiar for Discord streams as Twitch streams, will that work?
(still learning)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/14/2022 17:15

volume mixer is base windows
it's your system volume
so, it works for *literally anything on your computer, period*
this has been the case for multiple decades
and frankly I'm surprised there's still anyone who uses a computer who does not know this

=== @ NightmareJames 09/14/2022 17:23

I think I just forgot because I'm used to using OBS
I can fix it on my keyboard
Thanks Emily
