In 117, it appears that as you save quests, it slowly corrupts save files. It starts by drawing seemingly random tiles in the top left corner.

As you continue saving in any save file, the tile eventually becomes "tile 0"

And eventually, files will fail to load. Even ones you never saved in after creations.

Here is the saves folder from the hour of discovering this bug.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1147244564944531456/1147245218379354282/savesHoF.zip?ex=65eb60de&is=65d8ebde&hm=b45cd64081ae06eb2eb7ae879d40a4be11d173b4ed21aabd87c3707575d79c54&
At this point "Save", "Anime", "Test", and "Dragons" fail to load. I only saved in quests "Anime", "Test", and "Dragons", I never saved the quest beyond creation with "Save", yet it still reached the point of failing to load.

what's in your allegro.log?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2023 00:19

"Save" sav file fails to read here: https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/blob/3e20ca69332b818e8799746d7d1e3dfdf8e3afa5/src/zc/saves.cpp#L951-L951

`num_gen_scripts` is 65535, which I'm sure it wrong üôÇ

This is the log right after it fails to load a save file.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2023 01:17

I can't explain this yet:

when making a new save (classic 1st), the saving code writes 512 for "num of gen scripts".

When reading that same save .... it reads 0 for that field.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2023 01:37

I had trouble bisecting due to many uncompilable commits, but I suspect this one:

https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/6ce5cc9e700536e9252037a2120e0ee1318902e5#diff-2dbb93c39665d5fd3fc746f0ac9979014cb31fcba202c43d6580195ff06ab633

can you take a look later?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2023 01:43

Not sure where the save bug is here tho wrt. num gen scripts being zero

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2023 01:44

Trying to verify these save/read functions are correct is mind numbing üò¢

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2023 04:27

found it: `forced_xwpn` and `forced_ywpn` fields are written but never read from in latest versioning.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2023 04:54

I added a test `./zplayer -test-zc` that does a save file round trip. That is currently failing, but should pass when the bug is fixed.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2023 08:24

Next nightly has some save fixes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 08:29

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "can you take a look later?"): Been without Internet for like a whole day now lol
Glad you found it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2023 19:23

@ HeroOfFireZC let us know if this fixed the issue, should probably do a new alpha if it is fixed now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 19:24

wanna try to fix some of Mani's class/array issues as well first if possible

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/02/2023 22:01

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) which seems to be fixed, along with the win7 crash issues.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/04/2023 02:07

@ HeroOfFireZC did you get a chance to try the new nightly? I couldn't repro your exact issue here but I may have fixed it

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/04/2023 02:36

Well so far I've yet to see the graphical bugs, but it's hard to say how many times I need to save a quest to reach the point when it wouldn't load in 117.
So far so good, it let me go long enough to post that other bug I thought I saw in 117 but couldn't look into more cause, well, you know.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/04/2023 02:44

At minimum, there is no sign of obvious corruption, and I've saved and reopened ZC several times and all quests have loaded fine, so maybe fixed.
I do have a side question, is it intentional that saves no longer display Heart Containers?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/04/2023 02:46

I don't mind too much, I have a few quests that use scripted systems instead and thus the HC count never changes when the player gets more total Life. It does leave a suspicious blank space though.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/04/2023 02:49

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "I do have a side question, is‚Ä¶"): Nope!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/04/2023 07:01

Fixed the missing life meter
