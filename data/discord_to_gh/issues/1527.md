I've brought this up in the past, but it's still an issue and I'm really getting tired of working around what is likely a one line fix. If you change the enhanced music for a dmap via script, tile warps within the dmap, or between the dmap and another that shares the same music, cause the music to reset. This does not happen for side warps. It only occurs with tile warps. Could someone _please_ take a look at what is different in the music handling code in the two warp types and fix this. It's getting rather annoying rescripting tile warps to use side warps.

Emily's out for the day I think, so you're gonna have to wait until I'm done with what I'm working on

Seems like another ancient 2.50 bug bites the dust
