Right away after acquiring the nightly and giving it a try this morning, I noticed ZQuest's minimap's pink square is offset relative to the cursor.  It was a lot worse before I resized the window just slightly.

A shame Printscreen or Win+Shift+S doesn't capture the cursor to show how offset it is.

Here's a little snapshot of it.  The cursor is pointing to the white box.  The pink box is clearly below it.  

When I first opened ZQuest, the purple box was even more map-spaces __above__ it rather than below it.

Oof.  If I resize the window even smaller, it gets worse.

With the Window this small, the purple box isn't even visible.  Neat.

Only windowed or also fullscreen?

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/30/2023 16:36

Mm, Ii'll test fullscreen when I get home.  I only ever use Windowed.  Got a lot of things to look at in the background on the same monitor.

Okay.  _Findings._
1)  Fullscreen mode (via the checkbox in ZCL.)  makes it work perfectly.
2)  I manually set the resolution of ZQuest for 1600x900, (My preferred resolution for all Windows, and for New Years.  Thankyouverymuch.)  and it works perfectly again.
3)  When I go to resize a windowed mode _at all,_ it removes the black areas to the left and right, (as normal, and it's fine.)  ... and then it happens again.

it's trying üü™

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 00:21

the problem, like too many software bugs, was a bad cached value.

Great fix.  Worked great in the 31st's nightly.  üëç  Much appreciated.
