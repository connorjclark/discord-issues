Previously, upon entering a cheat code, you could press enter twice, then escape, to resume playing. Pressing enter twice no longer exits the cheat menu, due to the new option to select a cheat level, and pressing escape seems to close the menu and default it to level 0, even if option for 4 is selected. Could we make it easier to dismiss this dialogue without using the mouse? Like, pressing enter if there's no text in the cheat field is equivalent to ok?
This, as an aside, is a common trend with the new GUI stuff. A lot of previously convenient keyboard shortcuts don't work anymore, adding more time spent mousing to click on options

It was just requested to have enter do the cheat code confirmation
because otherwise pressing enter to confirm the code would close the dialog by clicking OK without confirming the code
escape clicks the `X` in the corner
which, rightfully cancels any changes made
I'm not sure what the best way to handle this is
and how to get whatever it is to *work*
