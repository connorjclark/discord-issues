When I make Z2 elevator shafts using "sideview gravity" flag and I go up or down to next screen and get off the shaft, it breaks the sideview gravity mode.

Can you elaborate on how it breaks? I'm guessing you mean that like, when you go to the next screen it isn't in sideview gravity mode anymore?

=== @ cbailey78 07/25/2022 22:11

Yes, I meant it's no longer sideview gravity anymore when i go to the next screen.

Both screens have the Sideview Gravity flag, right? Or is that a DMap flag

Oh nevermind, I figured it out. I had the wrong dmap.  That was the problem. Thanks.
