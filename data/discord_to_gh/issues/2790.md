@ Moosh if you can take a look
probably similar to the other dialog crashes recently somehow?
hopefully?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/24/2023 22:16

@ DeletedUser is this the latest nightly?

=== @ ChefBear 10/24/2023 22:17

Yep, just updated

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2023 22:17

yeah I recommended updating because this was just recently fixed elsewhere

what font you using?
acutually idk if that matters.

our crash log says it crashing on `TextField::setSwapType` but idk what that is

=== @ ChefBear 10/24/2023 22:20

These are my fonts

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "acutually idk if that matters…"): ....that sets the letter `D`/`H`/`LD`/`LH`/`B` for the decimal/hex/longdec/longhex/boolean entry modes
but
....there uh, shouldn't be any textfields in the passive subscreen dialog
(Are you looking at the *active* subscreen options by chance, @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) ? Different dialog)
(...though if both are crashing...)

=== @ ChefBear 10/24/2023 22:21

Only the passive one is crashing

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/24/2023 22:21

so it's all been corrupted by that point i guess
I'm just looking at the stack trace on sentry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2023 22:21

(replying to @ ChefBear "Only the passive one is crash…"): the passive subcreen settings, for the record, is literally just a page that says the text `No settings for passive subscreens yet!`
only active subscreens actually have any settings

=== @ ChefBear 10/24/2023 22:23

Ah ok lol

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2023 00:52

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....there uh, shouldn't be an…"): Hey take a wild guess what was _precisely_ the problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2023 00:54

(replying to @ Moosh "Hey take a wild guess what wa…"): ...?

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2023 00:54

Passive and overlay subscreens were still calling `refr_script();` which is then accessing null pointers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2023 00:54

. . .
. . .
. . . . . . . .
FUCK ME

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2023 00:54

lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2023 00:55

Why did that never crash in any of my tests???
I tested those damn things like 50 times

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/25/2023 00:55

uh why wouldnt a simple debug run catch that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2023 00:55

that's what I'm asking lmao

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2023 00:55

Did you test it before you implemented subscreen scripts?
Those were added after most of the subscreen stuff IIRC?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2023 00:55

those were fairly late....
but I could swear I-
....which `refr_script` call is it specifically?
. . . . is it the one in `view()` and no other?

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2023 00:56

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2023 00:56

. . . . . . . . because I think I missed that call initially
and added it to bugfix

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2023 00:56

ahhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2023 00:56

which I think that wasn't even in the rewrite
I think that was a much more recent commit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2023 00:57

...hmm, no, it was in the finalizing commit 1month ago
but it would have been like the LAST thing
so definitely easy to miss lol
I knew I tested them after adding the damn scripts, but missed the one line

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2023 00:59

Cut off one bug, three more grow in its place.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2023 00:59

lmao
the code is a hydra
neato thing is my zinit refactor looks to be just about done!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/25/2023 00:59

my urge to write a editor test that just spams input (or well, smartly opens all dialogs...) is rising
but i'll hold off on that and write proper tests when i get back to the automation project

=== @ Moosh 10/25/2023 01:00

That would be quite nice to have

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2023 01:02

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "my urge to write a editor tes…"): so, you know all the `call_[x]_dialog` functions in like each dialog file?
I would honestly like all of those to be forward-declared in a single `.h` file (or, more likely a shared plus zq/zc specific .h?) just to have them all includable separately- without also including the entire `Dialog` class bullshit (I mostly manually forward-declare them where used at the moment for much stuff, with a couple expections like `info.h` and such where I actually want direct access available)
....and in keeping them more organized like that, it would be more easy to keep track of adding new dialogs to that place and a test list at the same time
an open every dialog test would definitely help a ***lot*** of common bugs
