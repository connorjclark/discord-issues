placeholder to describe later basically but the additional animations from Z3 that make sense in ZC's context

-death faceplant
-hurt
-boomerang toss
-pound animation for wands and staves (neither of these had melee damage in Z3 if that simplifies things)

todo: port over frame data from bug thread and elaborate on/research relative positions of boomerang and death bonk, as well as spinning bug net frame data

these animations also make sense in a ZC context, but have their own cans of worms
-push: some things in LTTP don't show the push animation (so it's FAR more than just a combo type+solidity check and would likely need to be an all-combos flag a la hookability), and the pushing scripts that are on the database look silly while letting you move while pushing
-sword tap - same animation concept. you couldn't move while doing it in LTTP. though this may prove to be easier due to no combo fuckery involved

admittedly the sword tap is also a big priority (see: deafness improvements thread)
