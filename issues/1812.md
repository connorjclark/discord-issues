Just a random brain fart idea I had the other day, I figured I'd post it:

When setting a screens layer, include an option to configure X/Y scrolling speed for it. so, with, say. -0.5x, it would move one pixel to the right every other frame. Layers would loop in on itself.

You can already do these kind of draws with scripts, but for moving backgrounds or foregrounds this could be handy.
say a floating sky area, you could have a layer dedicated to a moving clouds BG.
or fog as an overhead layer
Basically it would be a utility feature for non-scripters. But I have no clue how hard this would be to add, so.

I'd ask no one to work on this until well after z3 scrolling lands and its kinks worked out.
b/c needing to touch scrolling code again makes me depressed üôÇ
