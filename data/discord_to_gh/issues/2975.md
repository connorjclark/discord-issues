Jump to page 85 or higher, crash. First off, it appears to be treating it as 96 per page, which is false; a pane shows 100 at a time, so if page size is equal to pane size, that's wrong, and if it's based off the "Open Alias/Pool/whatever Page" then that shows 260 at once because it's based off the tile editor.  

The real problem here though is that the amount of aliases, pools, and autocombos don't neatly align with the page sizes, meaning the last page is half size, which means you can't really jump to it; and I don't know the best way to go about fixing this. Combo pages show 256 at once, and that evenly divides 8192 (the current max for aliases/pools/auto), so could use the combo pages as a base instead of tile pages; I dont know how much work that'd be though.

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) what does "needs testing" mean in your usage? I assume you applied the fix and already know if it works in the editor, right?

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) working now?

Does how the page jump work make sense?

seems to, though it's hard to check when the only way to scroll the panels is with scrollbar and not the arrows at the top or the shift+arrow hotkey
