.
Have a bool[] for whether or not each item is 'equipped', which scripts can directly access; OR have an int[] for which item is equipped of each class?

New engine subscreen element (*BLEHG*) for 'equippable item'.
Has color: `Active Border Color`, draws that color rect around the object when that item is equipped
Has color: `Inctive Border Color`, draws that color rect around the object when that item is NOT equipped
Has item (the item to equip/dequip) or itemclass?
Has `Inactive Tile Offset`, offsets the item tile by that much when inactive

Init Data section for each itemclass defining whether or not an itemclass uses the 'Equipment' system.
If an itemclass does not, then there is no change.
If an itemclass does, then the equipped item of that class will be used, rather than the 'highest level owned' of that class.
When a new item of an itemclass is obtained, it is *NOT* equipped by default; each item must be manually equipped. (**SIDENOTE** Perhaps an item flag `Equip on pickup` to auto-equip it?)

modify `current_item`,`current_item_id`, to use equipped item instead of highest level item if that itemclass is set to use equipment in init data

my two cents: qr to auto-equip items that are NOT set to equip on pickup to any remaining slots (prioritizing A, B, X, Y in that order) if you HAVE less items than that equipped, as well as possibly a rule to allow for equipping and dequipping items (i.e. allowing empty A/B/X/Y slots or not)
as well as a gamedata thing to decide which button item gets its item overwritten by Equip On Pickup items (0-3, for A, B, X, Y). i can see modern quests wanting A and Z1 style quests wanting B

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "my two cents: qr to auto-equi…"): this has nothing to do with buttons
this is like, passive items, tunics/rings
