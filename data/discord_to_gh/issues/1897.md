What it says on the tin, the default max per frame is 1000, but having it be higher would be nice. I don't necessarily plan on drawing INFINITE things to the screen per frame, but I don't like working around the everpresent limitation when drawing things to the screen, especially complicated things (e.g. lots of particle effects, GUI elements, etc).

Draw limit is apparently already 10k
For the record, `Graphics->MaxDraws()` returns the draw limit for zscript to read
and `Graphics->NumDraws()` returns how many draws are currently in use for the frame

Okay, fair enough
