May just be a bug with the Koten file included, when I hit Authentic NES when making a new quest, the water is not solid as it should be.

Trying the same in 2.53 implies it may be an issue with the template dialog though. Also solidity preview in 2.53 shows a teal color for walkable water with the rule off, yet the latest nigtly has it unmarked

Water has never been *made solid* by rulesets
it is made *non-solid* by the more modern rulesets
but nothing has *ever* made it solid

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:43

Sorry the correct wording is it is not _left_ solid by the template dialog ü§¶

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:43

oh
tis quite different

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:44

So either it was never solid to begin or the template code that makes it walkable runs every time

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:44

would guess never solid to begin with
because that code only exists in the blocks for the newer rulesets
and all instances of that code would pop up asking you for confirmation of converting the water
so if you get no pop-up asking `"Convert all water to non-solid?"` then it isn't doing anything

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:45

No pop-up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:45

then aye, it just isn't solid in that tileset

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:45

But hitting no on the popup still leaves it walkable
Odd that it's that way in both the 2.55 and 2.53 defaults

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:46

Fun thing is it never used to have a popup even though it always has done that conversion, as far back as 2.50.2

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2021 22:46

Anyways, I'm meaning to comb over all ZQuest dialogues I can and report any oddities I find

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2021 22:48

Regardless, any issues with that tileset won't matter long
given #deleted-channel
anyway, marking this `not a bug`
