Whistle tornado sound effect won't stop playing after one use in latest Alpha 2.55

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/22/2021 17:52

When tornado is off screen and finished and gone it's sound still plays, over and over again.

Try un-checking `Weapons Can Go Out of Bounds (Offscreen)` under `options->backwards compatability->2`

Try giving the Whistles tornado a sound effect and see what happens.
