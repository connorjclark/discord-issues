I was playing a quest and progress was lost after a save and quit. I thought it might have been an accidental Retry after the first time it happened, but I made a conscious effort to save more often, and when it happened again it rolled back to a previous save I had made. I also checked the backups folder and it only contains the older saves. I have not been able to consistently trigger this. I noticed that the cursor also isn't defaulting to the last played quest after a Retry or Save/Quit, not sure if that's related at all.

@ DeletedUser
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
something is definitely seriously fucky here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/30/2023 22:44

anything in allegro.log?
ctrl+f "save"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/30/2023 22:48

given one thing that happened with chefbear, I feel like something is wrong re: `init_game` stuff
(Not only was he unable to save, but generic scripts' `InitD[]` was not properly applied)

=== @ Lejes 12/30/2023 22:49

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "anything in allegro.log?"): no

=== @ ChefBear 12/30/2023 22:50

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/30/2023 22:51

still unable to reproduce the issue myself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/30/2023 22:52

it's not, at least alone, either jit or replay recording causing the issue

=== @ ChefBear 12/30/2023 23:18

The other thing is that I *can* save so long as the quest uses save combos, and I F9 after saving. @ Zaxarone was having the same issue as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/30/2023 23:35

^ So, it's failing to write the save file when you save
but if you save (without quitting) and then F9 to `Reset`, it writes the save file properly

=== @ Attempt 12/31/2023 13:43

oh this is already reported
neato

=== @ ChefBear 12/31/2023 21:24

The saga continues

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:01

What's a specific quest ppl have seen this in? not reproing with quests i'm trying.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 09:07

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "What's a specific quest ppl h‚Ä¶"): @ DeletedUser experienced it with this quest. With the same quest, I was unable to reproduce.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:14

via simply making many different saves (loading then save and quit), in the same session in ASAN, i got a memory error in `saves_do_first_time_stuff` re: subscreen stuff
no closer to a root cause but memory issue is a potential one.
i feel like we solved this elsewhere before

ah yes, in init game we do `new_subscreen_active = nullptr;`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:17

perhaps `titlescreen` should call `init_game_vars` too.

=== @ ChefBear 01/01/2024 09:20

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:21

i delete when my brain catches up to my fingers
gonna try putting `init_game_vars` in bottom of game loop exit stuff, instead of in title screen - feels more natural a spot

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:29

i think i found *some* consistency
if i die and hit continue, and then save after, that seems to be when it happens the most
so something might be borking saves after continuing
it's the same thing via f6

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 09:30

Chef was having this happen every single time he tried to save, consistently

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:30

does it still say "write save" in the allegro log?
ignoring the ones that actually persist..
may be hard to tell given no timestamps there

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:34

it does not
it only writes a save if i don't "continue" the quest at all

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:42

so all these code paths call the same function. If it returns an error code you should see "Error writing saves" - but we aren't seeing that failure mode.

there's like 5 other ways a save file would decide to not write to disk (and give no error msg)... let me check one that is most sus

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:43

yeah there's no "error writing saves" for me either

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:44

you don't happen to have a replay file attached to this save with a `M sav` in the top of it?
should be impossible üôÇ

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:45

full transparency, i don't even know how to use replays
but i'll give it a shot

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:46

nah, if you are not recording, then that rules out this line of thought.

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:46

ahh okie

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:46

btw - all you do is enable that
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1190786799375761439/1191316572304851024/image.png?ex=65e59884&is=65d32384&hm=5c52e4d6171947f35f560da271dc393003ddae18888f8fb1ec7ff0148112dcad&)
then you'd see a replay file on disk for _new_ games.
which you can play back in this menu too whenever you like (doesnt effect the real save)

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:47

ahh gotcha
good to knoe üëç

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:51

tried out a replay, not seeing any `M sav` anywhere

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:52

does it happen w/ classic 1st for you?

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:52

lemme check

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:54

i reproduced it

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:54

groovy

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 09:54

exactly as you said w/ the dieing -> continue -> save

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:54

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "does it happen w/ classic 1st‚Ä¶"): btw no it doesn't

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 09:56

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "exactly as you said w/ the di‚Ä¶"): aye, that reproduces it for me as well.
Curious why ChefBear had it occur every single time no matter what

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 09:57

does that quest have save combos that just save without quitting?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 09:58

nope
though that was a way to *fix* the issue, IIRC
because saving without qutting, then exiting via `F9` to reset, DID save, even when saving and exiting normally did not

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 10:00

should have a fix.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 10:02

every continue was unsetting the save struct's `game` pointer at the top of titlescreen, so now the saving function thinks that save slot is not actively loaded
it was accidental perma-death (kinda) mode except no one told you üíÄ

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 10:04

i see
well hopefully it works

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 10:04

qq, if i collected rupees, die, and continue
should i keep them

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 10:04

ya should

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 10:04

ok thank goodness
i just brain farted on how it works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 10:05

only hp should reset on continue
which resets to a value set in init data

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 10:05

all fixed!
will do a new release shortly.

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 10:05

woot!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 10:05

now the fun question, did it fix it for ChefBear too, since theirs wasn't requiring `Continue`?
or is there another issue lol

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 10:06

only one way to find out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 10:11

fuck you know
I should have bothered to report the fact that the title music was playing lol
because that also would have pointed to this issue
but I forgot

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/01/2024 10:11

üé∫

=== @ ChefBear 01/01/2024 14:04

Drum roll please.....

||This is after fully closing the program as well. It saved, and no subscreen funk||

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 14:22

...the subscreen funk was probably a result of that memory error too, lol

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 17:00

saving works for me too
woot!

=== @ ChefBear 01/01/2024 17:29

I‚Äôm so happy this wasn‚Äôt just a thing w my pc üò≠
(So that it was fixable, not so that others had to share the problem)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 17:49

yeah, like, the specific ways in which the bug was presenting for you seemed to be specific to your pc
but, from the same root cause (bad memory access)

=== @ ChefBear 01/01/2024 17:50

Yee
