Come to think of it, this might be related to the other earlier issue I reported a while back with the palette thing.

Anyway, on EU keyboards, alt + number keys produces symbols.

In the build I'm sitting on, which is admittedly over a month old now, ZQ's string editor does not take this input anymore.

I realised when I tried to insert a backslash
and I just kept getting pluses.
I software switched to an american layout to get the symbol I needed, but that's less than ideal.

why wouldn't it just take what windows is telling it to

oh, uh
similar problem to one I remember being mentioned recently
this would be an allegro issue
We don't get the information of what key combo you've pressed
so if you type an `@` on that layout (`Alt+2`)
all we get is `KEY_2`,`alt`
and would need to parse that, somehow, into `@`....

=== @ Mani Kanina 08/02/2022 18:28

it's weird
because this stuff evidently worked on older allegro
because I had no issue with the string editor in older ZC versions
you'd think it'd be on the OS end, what with Alt Gr being generally similar to a function key on a laptop
but I guess not

(replying to @ Mani Kanina "because this stuff evidently…"): oh??
time to ping @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) mayhaps then

=== @ tim 08/02/2022 18:37

why im confused
its like we took a step backwards somewhere
and mind you it had to be working with zoria since he was on a uk keyboard
i asssume o_-

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "oh??"): yeah, this has always worked for me prior. Backslash is kinda needed for string control codes, which I have always used a lot of.

Probably same as https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/995118459870531774/997015145790312549
