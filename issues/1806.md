Adding negative values to counter pick-ups (for things like Rupoors). Maybe also adding negative values to the combo editor's Skip.X and Y, as well as A.Frames (to move backwards in a tileset, e.g. -2 on tile 5, would animate 5, 4, 3)

nooooope
none of that animation stuff
not fucking with that

=== @ P-Tux7 08/11/2022 21:28

huh? i thought you COULD do that with counter objects
seen it for rupees and hearts already
and the latter quest the guy isn't a scripter... so believe me when i say it's in-engine
also i don't see much value for animation stuff when there are so many tiles to use
i know that's how old games worked (z1 like like animation) but we have way more room

mike's fun house has the anti-hearts if anyone wants to study that quest

If I set this to a negative and hit OK, it becomes 0
internally, it is stored as a `word`, which is an `unsigned 16-bit integer`
i.e. range of `0 to 65535`
can't hold a negative

I've also played an old Lunaria/Mani quest that had rupoors in the slashable grass in one area. Can't remember the name of it though.

In other words, the feature WAS there before, and if it isn't now, that's a bug/omission.

Lnk stuck in Castlevania has both Rupoors ans poisonous mushrooms fully functional.

If someone can link a quest file for something that does it...

This is a fucking case of weird binary packing bullshit
and, new gui update not accounting for that
should be fixed

thank you!

=== @ P-Tux7 08/18/2022 06:08

or, fuck you for re-enabling this sort of thing on the part of bad quests i guess, but you did what was requested and also needed for backward compatibility... in all it's a wash, really!
