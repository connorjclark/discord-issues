Can we set the flicker rate of sprites when invulnerable with the quest rules that cause invincible sprites to flicker? This is to make it so quest makers who use the rule don't have to deal with framerate issues causing problems with visibility?

Oh hell yeah, seconding this idea

This could also influence CSet flash rate while invunerable too

might be worth making it a player option too?
for the same reason, in case someone recording zc needs to tweak the flicker rate so it shows up nicely

It being a player option could be handy. Unfortunately, that wouldn't fix the many issues of scripts making stuff flicker at 30 FPS but it'd go a long way to making the problem better.
