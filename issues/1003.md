ZScript needs a dedicated, well-defined RNG, maybe something from boost::random. Because its Rand() and SRand() just call the corresponding C functions, the behavior varies by platform and is affected by ZC's own use of rand().

I ran this on two different systems:
```SRand(0);
for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
    Trace(Rand(1000));```

On Windows:
```Global script 2 (RandTest): 38.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 719.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 238.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 437.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 855.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 797.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 365.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 285.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 450.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 612.0000```

On Linux:
```Global script 2 (RandTest): 383.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 886.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 777.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 915.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 793.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 335.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 386.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 492.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 649.0000
Global script 2 (RandTest): 421.0000```

I knew something seemed off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2021 00:50

What should be done here is, add an `rng` class; maybe `randgenerator`
(to zscript)
and allow creation of multiple generators
each with their own state
and `randgenerator->Rand()`, `randgenerator->SRand()`
using some more deterministic rng on the backend as suggested

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2021 01:18

@ Saffith Mind testing for cross-platform consistency in the branch `2.55-newrand`?
if it's all good there, I can work on further zscript options, but that should cover the main engine rng being consistent.
(no need for `boost::`, since there's `<random>` in C++11+)

=== @ Saffith 09/22/2021 01:34

Ah, right, forgot about that. Yeah, might take me a day or two, but I'll try it out.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2021 07:23

Nevermind, I went to test it and have run into an odd error

I fail to decrypt quest files. If I spam a key to make it keep retrying sometimes it suddenly decides to succeed once...
I'm very curious what could be causing this
while the quest reader does use rng for some parts of encoding, it uses its' own function, not anything that I would have touched...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2021 19:03

....ah
it's getting invalid temp file names

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2021 19:10

ah, duh. It doesn't expect negative output, so the call I used as the default can't be the default anymore.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2021 21:31

@ Saffith fixed issues

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/885611534187917383/890711992980111370/rng.qst?ex=65ea322f&is=65d7bd2f&hm=709bb5c7b15895f42d6c8b78a18cd4209630ad873e3adfe36f05711ade732fbd&
Build `2.55-randgen`, and run that quest in the built `zelda.exe`. It should print to console whether the RNG is consistent or not.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/23/2021 21:38

(also fixed the `unlink` issue for linux compile)

=== @ Saffith 09/25/2021 03:28

Didn't work, I'm afraid...
Damned if I can explain it, but apparently the only consistent function is `LRand` with no arguments.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:28

Hmm

=== @ Saffith 09/25/2021 03:28

(Also, ZScript_Additions.txt says LoadRNG is in FileSystem)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:29

Ah crap
`LRand()` is a straight call of the RNG with no filter
I think
While the rest use ` uniform_int_distribution`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:33

Yeah, that seems right
So something is off with that

=== @ Saffith 09/25/2021 03:46

I'm not sure that's meant to be deterministic. It sounds like the `mt19937` is just used to seed it. I think you just need to call `(*rng)()` and adjust the result.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 03:48

I need a way to make it uniform, hopefully, though
...time to get writing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 04:00

....yeah nope. Low-leaning it is.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 04:06

@ Saffith Use this
```cpp
int zc_rand(int upper, int lower, zc_randgen* rng)
{
    if(!rng) rng = &default_rng;
    if(lower > upper)
    {
        int t = lower;
        lower = upper;
        upper = t;
    }
    // std::uniform_int_distribution<int> dist(lower,upper);
    // return dist(*rng);
    return signed(unsigned(zc_rand(rng))%unsigned((upper-lower)+1))+lower;
}```
`random.cpp` function update
see if that works

=== @ Saffith 09/25/2021 04:07

Sure. It'll have to wait until tomorrow; Windows has another hour of updates to apply before I can get back in.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 04:08

ah fun

=== @ Saffith 09/25/2021 19:15

That seems to have done it.
Incidentally, the numbers from your test quest didn't change on Windows, so apparently that's what MSVC's implementation of `uniform_int_distribution` was doing anyway.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2021 19:45

...what
that's not fucking uniform though
windooooows

(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìZScript RNG is not predictable after SRand()

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/26/2021 16:05

Is this fixed?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/26/2021 16:20

Should be

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 05:17

Need someone to test if this is fixed, which... I actually don't think I can test this given how this depends on the OS

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 05:22

(replying to @ Saffith "That seems to have done it."): ^

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 05:24

```Emily ‚Äî 09/25/2021
...what
that's not fucking uniform though
windooooows``` this confused me
But I'm guessing that's more "why didn't a previous fix work" and not "why doesn't the current fix work"?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 05:26

"Why did the new implementation match the old implementation on windows"
i.e. the new method (which works cross platform, at the cost of not being a uniform distribution)
matched the old method on windows
meaning the windows implementation of `uniform_int_distribution`
....is NOT UNIFORM
but aye, should be fixed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 05:33

Okay, good
