So
Patras are mostly done, except that I tried to add a new attack and for some reason it isn't working, likely because I'm sleep deprived and am missing something obvious

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 23:18

I've shown off some cursed stuff, but really there's a whole lot of stuff that makes them really customizeable and you can now even have them be a multi-stage boss if you want
im unsure how I'd even want to make a video showing them off, because it's pretty expansive

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:19

just list them; i might be able to make some graphics for it in preparation

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 23:19

Both the center eye and inner eyes now have firing graphics
the slots for these graphics existed in old quests, but they were unused
They are now used if you enable it.
(this gives you a 32 frame window that you're about to be fireballed or whatever)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:21

is the tiles thing an enemy flag or qr?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 23:21

enemy flag

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:21

mm
do enemies have limited flags? can't remember
or was it as emily said just a matter of adding another tab if need be

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 23:21

limited only in we have a few and we'd need to add in handling for new ones

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:22

mm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 23:22

So basically adding a new tab
Probably have to add it sooner or later
Either way, patras are nearing completion, so once that's done, I have something that I don't think anyone will expect up next
(no, it's not antifairies)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:23

I feel like you have a much better chance of handling #1169 than I

=== @ P-Tux7 11/16/2021 23:23

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "Probably have to add it soone…"): why do i see emily shaking her head and holding up her hands behind you

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 23:23

Yeah probably
I can wrap my head aorund enemy code pretty well
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) showing off fancy stuff are we?
Well, here's something cursed instead.
```if ((((dmisc18 > 0 && !(zc_oldrand() % zc_max(dmisc18, 1))) ||

        || dmisc18 == -1))  dofire = true; //I'm embarrassed to have coded this if statement. God, what a mess. -Deedee```
single if statement

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:25

wha
wha
why
no
bad
what the absolute fuck is that shit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 23:26

complexity addiction

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:26

any top-level `&&` blocks can be broken into sub-if-statements
to make it more readable

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 23:26

Yeah, good idea
but I wanted to screencap this for posterity's sake

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/16/2021 23:27

jesus

Slightly better
that top one is always gonna be bad cause there's no top level &&'s to break down

=== @ P-Tux7 11/17/2021 00:00

go on?
new shooting graphics and?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/17/2021 00:18

New shooting graphics is all the new spritwise stuff it has
the rest is behavior stuff
stuff like spinning faster as a warning before doing the big expandy

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/17/2021 00:56

TODO: port BS Patras to the regular patra class
I was torn on either doing that or just porting all my changes to BS Patra, but
it turns out BS Patras can't have inner rings
and they just suck in general

=== @ P-Tux7 11/17/2021 04:47

yup and yup
they can't have pattern: big circle either
i think it would definitely be neat - if hard - to have patras and kids of variable size
or at least a checkbox that says "patra core uses twice the hitbox, tiles, and offsets that the kids do"
though wait, technically the BS patra is only twice as *wide*, not tall...
it has 32x32 graphics but a 32x16 hitbox

=== @ P-Tux7 11/17/2021 07:34

so an 8-way enemy now has a firing graphic? just a thought...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/17/2021 12:04

yup

=== @ Saffith 11/18/2021 02:36

I had Patras rewritten and combined already. It's probably too far removed to copy much directly, but it might be useful for reference. It's cleaner, at least. https://github.com/Saffith/ZeldaClassic/blob/enemies/src/enemy/hive.cpp

=== @ P-Tux7 11/18/2021 03:07

well isn't this funny
https://github.com/Saffith/ZeldaClassic/blob/enemies/todo_tamamos_list_for_enemies.txt

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 03:02

oh yeah darkmatt and "hero core" gave me a really weird idea
patras and inner rings that can be hurt even without their outer parts being defeated
(and perhaps a flag that makes the non-core parts invincible)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/21/2021 03:20

hopefully that would include code for auto-killing the outer rings lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/21/2021 15:45

I was planning on adding that
the problem is that I'm out of variables and I'd need to give enemies more

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/21/2021 15:47

Which means I need to add more eventually

=== @ P-Tux7 12/18/2021 07:58

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "so an 8-way enemy now has a f…"): oh i forgot to MENTION the thought i had
keese that shoot

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:47

so in this quest we have a bs patra with no kids who is set to shoot 5 fast weapons as its firing style
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/910307432402673724/926667809403047996/sanae.qst?ex=65ebcda6&is=65d958a6&hm=83b1b1b8a99f4d4608fa6b2275fa6738f445522596c1c4edb388b51b66506592&
it seems that they're kind of clumped together? i thought it would be like a walking enemy where they spread out
(ignore the glitchy graphics, it's just because i didn't configure the patra graphics to account for the added firing frames needed)

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 02:49

okay and when i set it to stream it's just not firing anything at all even though i have a weapon and "center eye" selected
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/910307432402673724/926668393422159972/sanae.qst?ex=65ebce31&is=65d95931&hm=b814830bfd2e607ec456bd58eee0159a48ffc8a5c42ede1e714a7b7fb0d07a1f&
same for breath - no shooting
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/910307432402673724/926668540956786698/sanae.qst?ex=65ebce54&is=65d95954&hm=7bb1ff95d8b3b98f6ab892b97da207c1a4592ad0a44b1467f5f09dc3f2faf136&
it's set in the data 4 tab

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:50

uh
yeah that's not right
I think it's something to do with you not using fireballs

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/01/2022 02:52

Yeah, seems like it's firing in the direction it's facing and not using the thing walking enemies do
I did something for angular weapons to mimick how it worked, but directions seem to not be done yet. whoops

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 04:05

no problem, take your time

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 16:21

should i make suggestions for patras here or in a new thread

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/04/2022 06:21

@ P-Tux7
#1319

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/13/2022 13:53

Okay, so looking a little at enemies
Goriyas can apparently just stop and shoot their boomerang whenever in Z1; they don't have to be on a full tile

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 13:55

Oh yeah, I need to check if that new enemy knockback rule fixes that weird thing where slow enemies sometimes don't get knocked back
Happens in 2.50 with Gibdos, Wallmasters, and Like Likes sometimes, and especially the slow Gibdos in Link's Grand Adventure 1/2

=== @ P-Tux7 02/16/2022 01:26

I wonder if you can merge Keese, Phantom Ghinis, and Peahats...? So that an enhancement to one of the three works for them all

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 01:35

I probably could?

=== @ P-Tux7 02/16/2022 02:26

yeah i heard about the planned weapon stuff for peahats in fireseraphim's peahat 2 thread so i figured it would be expedient
