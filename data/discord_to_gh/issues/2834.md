If string 2 has only SSCs and a final SSC of `\29` in it, if the previous string is shown using B instead of being allowed to display one character at a time, it never runs the end string SSC.```

@ Moosh help

=== @ Moosh 11/09/2023 17:42

Gonna need some more info I think. Did an increase counter followed by \29 and it worked fine. Maybe provide an example quest?

=== @ Phosphor 11/09/2023 22:58

(replying to @ Moosh "Gonna need some more info I t‚Ä¶"): All strings were shown using B

=== @ Moosh 11/09/2023 22:59

ah excellent

=== @ Phosphor 11/09/2023 22:59

strings in question are 563-565

=== @ Moosh 11/09/2023 23:00

Seems it's also screwing up the formatting of the string? Or does it show up like that in th editor?

=== @ Phosphor 11/09/2023 23:01

This is the intended behavior is the string is sped up with A instead

(replying to @ Moosh "Seems it's also screwing up t‚Ä¶"): I'm not seeing anything unusual in ZQ
The report is that the strings behave differently depending on if you speed it up with A or B

=== @ Moosh 11/09/2023 23:03

Gotcha. Since one of the strings was left aligned and the other was centered I was wondering if that was related

=== @ Phosphor 11/09/2023 23:04

I've been noticing it for a while but only just figured out the way to reproduce it

=== @ Phosphor 11/09/2023 23:05

I'm guessing it sorta just leapfrogs over the SSC instructing the engine to end the string when showing the full string with B, but idk why it still wouldn't execute it like it does with the warp code

=== @ Moosh 11/10/2023 09:43

```\18\dmap\screen\x\y\effect\sound - Warps Link to a specific dmap, and screen, at coordinates x, y.

If x is negative, y is used for the warp return point (0 to 3; 5 for pit warp).
    Valid effects: 
        0 == none, 1 == Zap, 2 == Wave, 4 == Mosaic, 5 == Opening Wipe
    If sound arg is a valid sound effect, then ZC will play that sound during the transition.```
okay a question for @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) , is this SCC supposed to clear the string after doing the warp? Bug seems to be in part caused by it not doing that. Setting `do_end_str = true;` after the warp immediately fixes the problem but I don't know if this was the intended behavior or not. It seems inconsistent about whether the string clears otherwise so could go either way

think that's Zoria's so I don't know the intent

=== @ Moosh 11/10/2023 09:46

oh that's just great
are there any other instances where a string can persist through a warp? Wanting to say no

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 08:52

@ Moosh did you make any additional progress here?

=== @ Moosh 12/14/2023 11:36

Thought I'd fixed this one already. Apparently not. One line fixes are clearly require too much focus for me üôÑ
Should be good now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 03:29

need to backport to 2.55 `546e736`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 04:35

oh, did this already.

@ Phosphor let us know if it's fixed for you

=== @ Phosphor 12/21/2023 22:29

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "oh, did this already.

<@1989‚Ä¶"): Works
