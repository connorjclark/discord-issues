When a combo is hovered over in the combo pane/screen, have its label be displayed. This would be really helpful to the user for, say, Warp/Pits A-D, special bushes and vases that always drop items, etc.

I've requested this before

=== @ P-Tux7 06/15/2023 03:33

This ideally would be adaptive to only show a label when the combo has a label, but a blank label row on such combos would be fine too

Thought so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 03:41

looks like it already exists, but only on the pane, not the screen itself

=== @ vlamart 06/15/2023 03:42

Oh, yes. Screen please üòä

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 03:51

the screen one is already a biiit cluttered

...ahk, cleaned up.
Now it will only show the flags if at least one of them isn't 0, and it won't show the combo type for `(None)` combos

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Now it will only show the fla‚Ä¶"): oh this is great

=== @ P-Tux7 06/15/2023 17:25

also, while you are in the zone so to speak, could you please add the inherent flag to the combo pane if it has a non-0 flag

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/15/2023 18:14

These flags have names right? Can we use them, for example: `Flags: (5) Some Flag Name`

=== @ P-Tux7 06/15/2023 19:51

true. might need to be a settings toggle because that could get long and intrusive
which is why i never suggested it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/15/2023 22:05

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "These flags have names right?‚Ä¶"): the names can be pretty long, and are user-editable

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/15/2023 22:08

They could be on a new line each, would that help
