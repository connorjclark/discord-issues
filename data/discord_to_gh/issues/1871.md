1)  Define something with liftable properties.  Set their Undercombo, and their specific "This is what gets thrown" combo.
2)  In the Combo Pages, go a a combo numerically earlier than that combo defined in #1
3)  Press "i" to slide in a blank combo where the cursor is.  (I typically do it 4 times, as would most people I suppose.)
4)  Go back to the combo from point 1.  You'll see its Undercombo and the "What gets thrown" part are now different combos.

So as the title says, inserting or removing Combos don't yet offset those particular Combos.

So this is more of a reminder than a bug, of course.

Update:
--------
Apparently this affects Combo Pool entries too, not just liftable pot things.
I'd made a combo pool for Cambria Pathing stones, and did some [i] work, and later, that combo pool was full of gravestones and random fence pieces or something, and I never made a gravestone and fence pool.

ah fuck
yep
bleh
(Any time anything new is added that uses combos, it needs to update a stupid thing in the combo editor for that, and I definitely forgot that for both)
