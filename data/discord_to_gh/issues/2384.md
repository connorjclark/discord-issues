A way to give the player a non-counter item when a bottle is used, for example, a magic shield like a "backup shield".

This could also be interesting for one use arrow/bomb/boomrang/etc. in a bottle

=== @ P-Tux7 05/24/2023 18:59

oh, true

(replying to @ vlamart "This could also be interestin…"): at the same time, you can just do that with counters?
if you wanted limited uses of brang you could use a brang ammo counter
it would be a bit clunky to do it with bottles imo

=== @ vlamart 05/24/2023 19:10

But that would increase ammo, not shoot said weapon out of the bottle, yeah?

(replying to @ vlamart "But that would increase ammo,…"): ....shooting the weapon out of the bottle would not happen anyway
that's not a thing that will be possible
what your suggestion would do is, you use the bottle, which GIVES YOU a boomerang- then you would have to equip the boomerang and use it
(presumably said boomerang would then be consumed on use)
but that would not be "shooting a boomerang by using a bottle"

=== @ P-Tux7 05/24/2023 19:34

hmm... maybe bottles could just display strings and empty themselves?

=== @ P-Tux7 05/24/2023 19:36

sccs can already give items, and this would have the effect of adding other stuff SCCs can do such as warping (one-use dungeon exit) and secrets (think using a bottle of water on a screen with a seed)

=== @ P-Tux7 05/28/2023 19:23

Actually, would it be easier to just run a string when a bottle filler is used? That means one could run a string in addition to bottle things like curing jinxes, which means you can give an item, refill multiple counters and custom counters... all in the same string per bottle filler

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/28/2023 19:28

. . . ?
you don't seem to understand how bottle fillers work
