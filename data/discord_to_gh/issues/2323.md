This happened when I was testing solid FFC and enemy interaction. I noticed a weird behavior with the "FF Combos Wrap Around" quest rule causing LInk/enemies in the path of the object to teleport. Messing with this lead to discovering a game hang to do with this behavior.

Seems to be something to do with that particular screen wrap having two intersecting solid FFCs
Here's the quest file, happens on the second screen, you can drag and click the mouse to move the enemy and the behavior is easily reproduceable

Seems to be. Although I'm noticing the enemy's not able to walk onto the bottom or rightmost combos now
Don't remember if it could before. I think it could?
okay nope that was always the case. Question is "why"
