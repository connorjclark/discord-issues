A combo that starts walkable and pushes player off (speed fixed to walkspeed and dir in attributes), then takes A.Frame and pauses on the last frame and become fully solid. Reacts to either secrets or screen states (flagged, specified by attributes, marking neither flag makes it a permanent shutter), by reversing the animation and becoming walkable with no push. Additional flag for if the push closing and opening animation replays everytime you reenter or just once

Another flag for if screen freezes during opening/closing animations
