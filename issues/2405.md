Issue in title. Percussion tracks become nearly inaudible if ZC is paused, tabbed away from, then back in. The issue is corrected when entering a new area with a new music track or after F6 -> Continuing.

I can't copy the ZC player's info, so I'm grabbing the corresponding version's ZQ info

This has been present for ages. Since 2.5... .2, I think? It was part of the fix for the piano midi bug that was far, far worse

=== @ Phosphor 06/02/2023 21:35

I have zero recollection of it until recently tbh
It might've been early 2.53? I wasn't present for a lot of that version.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 21:36

Does changing sound fonts make a difference?

=== @ Phosphor 06/02/2023 21:36

Well I don't have any downloaded, so I can't test that

=== @ Phosphor 06/02/2023 21:38

I really only noticed the problem when reporting other bugs and noticing the midi I had written in the background of one area had no percussion suddenly when playing back the video

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/03/2023 09:10

As of late this issue has been getting worse indeed. Used to be sporadic, but now almost everytime when ZC loses focus the MIDI volume is lowered greatly (not necessarily only the percussion tracks). This is really annoying actually and would be nice if it finally gets fixed

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/07/2023 20:17

I've noticed that if you change the volume level when that happens it fixes it as well (besides entering another dmap or F6ing like Phosphor described).
Perhaps an appropriate fix would be programmatically resetting the MIDI volume to the volume picked by the user after blurring and focusing on the program?

And I think my previous comment probably came off as inpatient, my apologies

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/07/2023 20:29

Can you provide a repro using just classic quest, or even better, the zquest midi tune menu in Etc?

I ask because I don't exactly know what to look for, and it could be track specific, and it even could be OS specific and I'd never hear the problem on my Mac... All these things combine to make the problem harder to debug on my end, that's where more specific and simple repro steps help.

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/08/2023 07:40

What do you mean by repro? Steps to reproduce the problem?
It seems rather random to me so that'd be hard to do. I could record a video on the issue for sure
I'm on Windows, haven't had the issue on Mac yet, but I hardly play(test) quests on that

Would recording a video help?

And I am quite convinced that my idea would fix the volume issue. I'm more than willing to help with testing such a solution as well if that helps.

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/08/2023 07:42

And MIDIs are plain wonky (as you probably know very well). One .mid file could sound different in VLC, Windows media player and in ZC itself though I only have one soundfont installed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
I guess MIDIs really are a thing of the past, but a lot of quests use them still of course. Even the new quest I'm working on

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 08:02

Yes, steps to reproduce. Nope, video wouldn't help. I haven't looked yet but I know I'll need a certain midi file to test on. 

Is there a midi in ZQuest tune player that recreates it? Or can you find a .mid that can be played in zquest to hear the problem (losing percussion when tabbing back in)?  Is it literally any midi? If it's not consistently reproducible, that's fine and good to know too, just harder to work on a fix.

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/08/2023 08:08

It happens to all MIDIs in my quest as far as I can tell. It simply happens when playing for a while and alt tab a couple of times during that. F.e. I was playtesting a couple of hours yesterday and alt-tabbing often to fix or note a bug and I'd say it happened 50% of the time. It doesn't matter if you freeze ZC first before losing focus

So I'd say it's reproducible, but there aren't specific steps to make it happen consistently.
I will send you my quest file if that helps and note some areas there where I recall it happening yesterday

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 08:14

in meantime `midi_patch_fix = 0` probably fixes it?
(replying to @ Twilight Knight "I will send you my quest file‚Ä¶"): That would help, thanks!

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/08/2023 08:14

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "in meantime `midi_patch_fix =‚Ä¶"): Do I need to set that in my zquest cfg? Then I will try that tonight

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 08:16

`[zeldadx]`
it's player only
zquest will pause music in the background, but zelda will not
...unless on windows and that midi patch is on (it is by default)

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/08/2023 08:18

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "it's player only"): ugh of course haha

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 08:18

https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/blob/5234752d58ed68a749bd62e6b12edf9a498e4de8/src/zc/zc_sys.cpp#L8270-L8288

I wonder if pausing the music should tied to the `pause_in_background` option, and the "midi_patch_fix" get nixxed
It's an old workaround for some unknown-to-me-bug, and we've totally changed how midi is played w/ allegro5 soooo

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 08:20

also maybe ZQ should have a pause_in_background option too (it always pauses, unlike the player https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/blob/5234752d58ed68a749bd62e6b12edf9a498e4de8/src/zq/zquest.cpp#L29060-L29064 )

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/08/2023 08:20

Aha
Yes I recall from back in the day that the midi not pausing while losing focus on ZC caused it to be glitchy as well, so that is probably what that midi_patch_fix is for
And do you reckon that resetting the volume after focussing on ZC again would be benificial and doable? Me thinks it should help

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 08:21

Yes, I'll be trying that when I look at this later.

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/08/2023 08:40

Awesome, I'll try turning the midi_patch_fix off tonight to confirm if that is the cause

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 19:38

btw, the code is already re-setting the volume when this midi patch option is on when focus is regained
It pauses it in a pretty convulted way, don't see why it can't be as simple as how zquest does it, so I'll make some changes there and perahps it'll fix what you're seeing.

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/08/2023 20:09

Alright nice!
I've also done my investigation work:
turning off midi_patch_fix fixes this issue indeed

Also I'm not able to consistently reproduce the problem (with midi_path_fix on) when just randomly alt tabbing, switching windows manually, freezing and blurring, blurring without freezing... Non mattered, there must be some randomness to it

And now I think I might have another idea is that MIDI files can contain ChannelVolume change events. Perhaps this is part of the "randomness", blurring the program exactly when such an event is supposed to occur.

Anyway I hope your changes would cover that, I bet that'd fix a lot of older quest's soundtracks

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 20:17

I've removed the always-pause-midis thing that midi patch option was doing, and now music is only paused if paused_in_background is on. It'd be good to test that leaving that option _off_ (the default) is still ok.

I'll have a test release soon, can you play with it?

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/08/2023 20:19

Certainly, but at this moment I'm mainly focused on getting my demo good to go for the version it's made with
After the PZC expo launches I'll be playing those submissions too, and if they have midis I will use your build
Anyway, thanks for taking care of this so quickly!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 20:20

This is a fix good to have for the expo, so let me bring in someone else to test sooner. @<role: Tester> ?

=== @ Twilight Knight 06/08/2023 20:25

Perhaps @ Phosphor could check this out? He was also experiencing the issue

=== @ Phosphor 06/08/2023 20:28

I'll try when I get on PC yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2023 20:29

Cool thanks, will be ready soon

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/08/2023 20:30

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I've removed the always-pause‚Ä¶"): Would be good to add a toggle for paused_in_background in the UI then

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "https://github.com/connorjcla‚Ä¶"): Works for me

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/17/2023 08:30

Next nightly has the discussed changes.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/17/2023 22:55

@ Phosphor @ Rebonite does the latest nightly still have the original problem?

=== @ Phosphor 07/17/2023 23:43

I'll have to check when I can

=== @ Twilight Knight 07/19/2023 16:47

I will soon do a test run Connor and try it out, thank you

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 22:46

Any more issues here?

=== @ Phosphor 07/30/2023 05:40

Not from what I can tell

=== @ Twilight Knight 08/04/2023 07:16

I'm sorry, still haven't tested yet
