=== @ Moosh 05/07/2023 02:41

Unsure what's going on here. The crash seems to happen right as the function returns, line 380. As a test example, you can use the Example Enemy from the script database, screen 1:02. May need a recompile

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/07/2023 02:50

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I'm guessing something to do with classes?
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=499 the header in question
(since Example Enemy doesn't seem to link to it)

=== @ Moosh 05/07/2023 02:55

seems to be any class function with a return

=== @ Moosh 05/07/2023 02:57

Doesn't even have to return a _value_ functions in classes have just broken. Joy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2023 03:41

... How did:
1. This not get spotted sooner
2. I not catch this
I didn't handle returns. At all. Completely slipped my mind.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/07/2023 03:43

huh
I guess my rewind code didn't return anything at all
wait the fuck
@ Moosh did it not crash when you first updated the header to use classes?

=== @ Moosh 05/07/2023 03:46

It didn't

=== @ Moosh 05/07/2023 03:47

I hadn't touched ZC in a bit so the nightly I was using was from a couple weeks back I think

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/07/2023 05:07

might take me a bit, I'm like entirely out of dev energy here
and it's my shit so not sure if deedee or connor would even be able to untangle it to fix it

=== @ Moosh 05/09/2023 09:26

Oh yeah, forgot to make a note of this earlier, but switching to the x86 build of the latest nightly fixed this for me. Deedee was not able to replicate the crash on x64 so...

ü§∑

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 16:38

@ Moosh can you make it crash again, so I can see it in most recent crash reports on Sentry?

=== @ Moosh 06/01/2023 16:50

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@ Moosh can you‚Ä¶"): Done

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 16:54

huh, not seeing it show up...is there a `.sentry-native` folder in your installation?

=== @ Moosh 06/01/2023 16:55

yeah
I crashed it from test play mode. Would that make a difference?

=== @ Moosh 06/01/2023 16:58

last_crash in the sentry folder doesn't seem to be updating either

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 16:58

I don't think it should. Maybe you need to close ZQuest first before it uploads?

=== @ Moosh 06/01/2023 16:59

done

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 17:03

My only guess is it isn't a crash but a call to exit...
I'll try running with a debugger.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 17:06

( if so: we should instead call `abort` for crash generation. `assert` also works )

=== @ Moosh 06/01/2023 17:09

makes sense. A lot of the time ZScript "crashes" look  identical to closing the program normally, rather than the grayed out "stopped responding" message

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 19:07

may not report the crash still, but the latest nightly uses `abort` more

=== @ Moosh 06/01/2023 19:52

Ran it a few times. Is it reporting anything?
Crash still looks like an ordinary exit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 20:07

Nope! I'll use a debugger later. Thanks for trying again

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 23:43

(replying to @ Moosh ""): So how do I trigger the crash? `-test thatquest.qst 0 0` loads a screen with a green square but it is not crashing for me running the win32 build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/01/2023 23:43

It wouldn't crash on win32, it was 64bit only

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 23:43

oh!
doi

=== @ Moosh 06/01/2023 23:44

Yeah it only crashed for me on 64 bit and it crashed shortly after loading in on 0 0 when the enemy spawns and its script runs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 23:45

Re-setup my windows machine to look at this, building 64bit now.

=== @ Moosh 06/01/2023 23:46

```        int AddAnim(int animID, int tile, int numFrames, int aSpeed, int loopFrame, int nextAnim, int flags){
            int tmp_animID = animID;
            if(animID==-1)
                tmp_animID = NumAnims;
            
            int arraySize = SizeOfArray(__Anims);
            if((tmp_animID+1)*ADI_END>arraySize){
                printf("[NPCANIM ERROR] Not enough room in animation buffer for animation.\nAnimation ID: %d\nBuffer size: %d\n", tmp_animID, arraySize);
                return -1;
            }
            
            SetAnimProperty(tmp_animID, ADI_VALID, 1);
            SetAnimProperty(tmp_animID, ADI_TILE, tile);
            SetAnimProperty(tmp_animID, ADI_NUMFRAMES, numFrames);
            SetAnimProperty(tmp_animID, ADI_ASPEED, aSpeed);
            SetAnimProperty(tmp_animID, ADI_LOOPFRAME, loopFrame);
            SetAnimProperty(tmp_animID, ADI_NEXT, nextAnim);
            SetAnimProperty(tmp_animID, ADI_FLAGS, flags);
            
            if(animID==-1)
                ++NumAnims;
            else
                NumAnims = Max(NumAnims, animID+1);
            return tmp_animID;
        }```
This function in NPCAnim.zh is where it crashed according to the OP

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/01/2023 23:53

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I didn't handle returns. At a‚Ä¶"): so, I poked at the code side of this a little to see what I was talking about here, but it actually looks like its' handling it fine.... so my initial diagnosis was wrong and I have no idea.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/01/2023 23:55

no crash :/

=== @ Moosh 06/01/2023 23:59

hmmm...Now I'm not getting it either on that file
Lemme check if I'm getting it on the more complex one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 00:00

fixed by something unrelated?
Are array/string literals being used anywhere in your code? We fixed a MASSIVE issue with those recently
...not sure if it would cause crashes though. But w/e

=== @ Moosh 06/02/2023 00:01

What I'm suspecting might be going on is that it's caused either by a setting in one of my configs or some other persistent file that would not be replaced when copying over the whole folder...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 00:03

...oh, fun
I can't compile debug for windows?

=== @ Moosh 06/02/2023 00:04

Haha!
zc.cfg is indeed related

Try with this and see if it happens

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 00:04

How the fuck are these two conflicting

neither of these are our files...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 00:05

Emily, I just found that too. For now you can use RelWithDebInfo.
Well, you have jit on.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 00:06

yeah, it's jit

=== @ Moosh 06/02/2023 00:06

yup, just noticed that myself

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 00:07

Neat, I'll check this out.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 00:07

jit = 0, no more crash lol

=== @ Moosh 06/02/2023 00:07

Odd that it was behaving differently, but at least it's easy enough to fix for the moment

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 00:07

probably wasn't 64-bit specific either
it was probably just the config being off when you grabbed 32bit

=== @ Moosh 06/02/2023 00:08

would the configs be different?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 00:08

jit is off by default in all configs, pretty sure?
so, you had to enable that at some point

=== @ Moosh 06/02/2023 00:08

I mean this wasn't the one in base configs, this is my persistent one from previous tests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 00:08

oh
err
you dragged it to the 32 bit too, duh
then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
but yeah, JIT + classes combined makes sense as a cause
neither of them is a stable system on its' own, so combining them....

=== @ Moosh 06/02/2023 00:10

And the only reason I had JIT enabled was to see "Hey, will this break anything" before I forgot all about it

Mission accomplished I suppose? ü§£
Anyways, thanks for putting up with my nonsense here. Hadn't even considered that configs could be responsible for something like this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 00:49

Just had to account for the new pattern of function calling that class contruction uses. simple fix to jit
```

neat

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 01:13

Also pushed a change to simply fail compilation if something like this changes again (which falls back to non-jit for that script).
Now to work out why the crash reporting did not work. I was able to get a report uploaded simply. using the latest nightly...
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1104598865363095592/1113998960953151498/image.png?ex=65ea6661&is=65d7f161&hm=39b2de61de345bd6e9530c0ede9f9b4ab8244680b8eb2d7f5619949d55896c55&)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 01:15

Confirming that it only crashes for 64 bit. Likely just because of how unpredictable corrupting memory is on a program.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 01:19

Don't know how to continue investigating this. Sucks that a report wasn't sent from @ Moosh's machine.
You were using a published nightly right? Not using a locally-built-from-source?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 01:20

firewall or something preventing the outgoing traffic?
( ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è )

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 01:20

He said there was nothing in the `.sentry-native` folder, though.
So didn't even generate a crash dump

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 01:20

ah, yeah, true
that's odd

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 01:21

`crashpad_handler.exe` in your folder too?

=== @ Moosh 06/02/2023 01:32

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "You were using a published ni‚Ä¶"): Yup, using 6-01-2
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "He said there was nothing in‚Ä¶"): What would a crash dump look like?
There were some files and folders that were getting updated

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 01:34

`.sentry-native/reports/` would contain `.dmp` files.

=== @ Moosh 06/02/2023 01:34

ah yup, no dumps
is there a config setting that'd disable sentry reporting?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 01:35

nope

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/02/2023 02:01

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Confirming that it only crash‚Ä¶"): no...jit is disbled for 32bit because i didn't want to support it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/02/2023 02:19

ahahahaha
that'd make sense then
