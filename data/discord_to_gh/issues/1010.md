I would like to suggest an option in the zquest editor under media named "play music from within quest", which as labeled would play the midis already inside the quest file, with the internal loop data that's added. This is so those who want to can listen to their quest's midi soundtrack while editing said quest.
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Now I have a proper thread for this.

perhaps it should be named "Play Midi from within quest" or something that less of a mouthful. Perhaps "Play Quest MIDI" or something like that

Also supporting this request. Helps choosing music for quests.

Thirding this
Even if it has to wait a bit for other bugs to be fixed
