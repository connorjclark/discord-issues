I scrolled through the fonts list and compared them to the BS Zelda games and I noticed that they are missing. Can these be added to ZC?

If you can create a `.bmp` file like the ones in `customfonts/example fonts`
that would make it easy

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 06:39

So wait, you can add additional fonts to the editor?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 06:39

The user can't *add* fonts, though they can *replace* fonts with other fonts
I can probably add new fonts to the engine as a whole

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 06:40

I meant as a font that can be displayed in ZC quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 06:40

so, to actually add a new font
it needs to be added to the `zquest.dat`
(`modules/classic/classic_zquest.dat`)
...err, sorry
my brain is on zquest.dat because of the mouse stuff I just did
obviously it's the *`fonts.dat`*
(`modules/classic/classic_fonts.dat`)

yep, that loaded the bitmap as I expected
so

This is the mr saturn font
but, you can see how it is laid out for the font

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 06:47

so, every pink area being a rectangle, black separating the rectangles, and white in the rectangles indicating pixels that are part of the character
as far as I'm aware, any `.bmp` laid out like so, using the same colors, should be able to be loaded easily?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 06:49

it does however completely fail to load the png available via your link
so, if you can convert it, I can add it.

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 06:54

Some fonts do not seem to quite work with ZC's text box system

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 06:54

what do you mean?

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 06:55

Due to the way they are set up, they leave large gaps at the bottom of text boxes at the most fitting size

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 06:55

oh
well.... you can change the size of the boxes
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 06:56

They can only be changed in 8 pixel increments
And those 8 pixel increments do not match up with all fonts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 06:56

ah, fair

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 06:56

I understand why this is the way it is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 06:56

you could use the Full Tile Background to give it a custom background, but that would be a lot just to shorten the box

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 06:57

Yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 06:57

...oh, though
you could just use a modified frame?
maybe?
eh, depends on what your original frame looks like

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 06:57

Worth considering

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 06:58

the default z1 blue frame has 3 pixels wide of extra space inside the frame tile
so you can make it 3 pixels tighter on each side

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1087262181424365618/1087269016676081724/image.png?ex=65e5712e&is=65d2fc2e&hm=19da82f44a7fae9d0d21feed6e168fd83f347288bf33b4365ddc1c9d9bab1192&)
It uses the 8x8 minitiles as the units
(thus the yellow to indicate the corner we ignore here)
those 3 black pixels are what you'd gain

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 07:14

This approach will need to be hand tailored to whatever font you're using

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 07:16

yeah, it's just a problem with how the frames work

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 07:17

Twas a good idea but unfortunately that did not work in my case

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 07:18

The only other idea I had was tinker with the V spacing to make it fit and I am not sure about how keen I am about having inconsistent V spacing depending on the size of the textbox

=== @ Orithan 03/20/2023 07:20

What would look the least bad is if I adjust the Top margin to make the text fit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/26/2023 20:47

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so, if you can convert it, I‚Ä¶"): ^ this still stands, if you want new fonts

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/28/2023 21:48

slightly offtopic but can you send me a more complete image template for custom fonts? I want to try and do the font for Castlevania 3 - Dracula's Curse

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 01:11

(replying to @ FireSeraphim "slightly offtopic but can you‚Ä¶"): the two fonts you gave me have been added
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "as far as I'm aware, any `.bm‚Ä¶"): ^Also it turns out it needs to be the proper indexed palette, too. It no longer does for the `customfonts` folder method, but, it still will for me to add new fonts *to the program*.

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 02:19

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I'm back from my chores, and I'm going to get started on a few more fonts

=== @ FireSeraphim 03/29/2023 02:28

I want to at least get six more fonts made

BSZ as you would see in BS Zelda and a proportional version to modernize it

=== @ Orithan 03/29/2023 09:46

Very similar to NES Zelda in a lot of ways, including running on an 8x8 tile grid and the lowercase letters being identical.

=== @ Orithan 03/29/2023 09:47

It's puzzling why the devs back then took various letters from BSZ and added it to various fonts but didn't include a proper BSZ font.

Looks good? @ Orithan

Thanks

‚ù§Ô∏è no problem! Thank you!

They are not selectable in the subscreen editor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 02:28

bleh, really? stupid subscreen editor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/08/2023 10:25

I'm just gonna close this, it'll be fixed in the subscreen editor when I finish redoing the subscreen stuff
