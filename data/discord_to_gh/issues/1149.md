Something similar to the "Draining Rupees Can Still Be Spent" rule being off, where if you continue or save and quit while the door repair is draining your rupees, it will subtract the full amount automatically.
I'm not sure if the existing rule fixes Life or Money rooms, but if not, that needs to be too.

I think it already works this way

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 12:49

@ HeroOfFireZC I don't think it does does it?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:15

I think that you can cheat out of that, and I know that you can cheat out of LikeLikes
These are both easy hero script fixes but could be in engine

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:24

I'll be honest, having the likelike thing as a QR seems like advocating for assholeish design
"tick this to piss off 100% of your playerbase!"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2021 14:29

I mean, it's fixing a bug
Frankly it should be on by default
(The assholeish design part is *using door repair rooms*)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:30

I mean "f6ing out of likelike"
the door repair part should be fixed yeah
my mistake, forgot to clarify

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:56

why not both?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:57

if you encourage cruelty to animals go 100%

=== @ P-Tux7 11/03/2021 15:09

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "I think that you can cheat ou…"): i don't view f6ing for like likes as cheating
when you spend the rupees, the game intends to take them away instantly
but like likes have a timer before they eat your shield

=== @ P-Tux7 11/03/2021 15:12

granted, it is usually used when the player can't kill the like like before that timer expires, but it's still a case
and at the very least should be a separate QR from draining rupees
(not that i really desire it as a rule)
and when you get into rupee/magic draining like likes it just gets hairy. how much to deduct for an F6?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 15:13

I will make zero effort into implementing it as a rule

=== @ P-Tux7 11/03/2021 15:13

^

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "and at the very least should…"): Separate yes
