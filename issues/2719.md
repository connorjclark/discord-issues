It's an entity that's basically just a graphic (Tile or Combo?) that you can slap down in the subscreen, but the interactive part of it is that its appearance will differ depending on whether or not you have a specific item.

It's the sort of thing that would easily allow for you to have a mannequin and dress it up in the items you have.
For example, you'd be able to go from this,

To this.

They're not the same items in both scenes obviously, but the ramifications are endless.  And all it is is a tile with length and width settings and a pulldown for the item, and a checkbox to tell it to REMOVE the graphic if the player has the item, rather than add it.

so, you just want `Tile Block` to be able to be conditionally visible

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/07/2023 18:06

Depending on the presence (or lack thereof) of items, basically.
Equipment items, I suppose.
Or not, who knows.   People are creative.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2023 18:11

I mean, you can't HAVE a non-equipment item, that's impossible
that's... what equipment item means, it's an item you can HAVE

As long as my initial request and its purposes were relatively understood, regardless of my temporary inability to talk the talk.  o.o
Being able to change subscreen elements with the addition or modification of inventory items would be revolutionary.
Even if it's just non-interactive visuals.

so, really, the way to do this properly
is to design a whole condition system

i was thinking just LTMs

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/09/2023 02:03

LTMs affect subscreen things?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/09/2023 02:27

no, but that's how i would imagine widgets' tiles could be item-dependent
