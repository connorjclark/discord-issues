I don't know If this is a bug or whatever, when I make an explosion effect on a combo, the decoration sprite FX draws a few pixels up from the tile.

It most definitely spawns aligned to the grid
What type of decoration are you using?
One of the clippings types, or the generic "whatever sprite you want" type?

...oh, found it
Looks like all decorations have a `-2` yoffset when created?
seems like an old hardcode, that will need a qr
