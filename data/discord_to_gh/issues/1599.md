This option would allow right click replace to apply to the entire current map. It would save TONS of individual screen work if you were converting tilesets!

Replace _what_ specifically?  Can you give an example, @ DergerSwerson ?  Curiosity.

just individual tiles. if you have a large tileset with differing tiles that need to be laid out first on a screen by screen basis, you could instead do the entire map by tiles you replace, not just the current screen. it would save... i dunno, about 7E screens worth of replacing? just do it once and the whole map has its tiles replaced. Then you can move on to secondary work like adding edges and stuff

alternately it could just be a 'Replace on All' button
