My Yuurand save file keeps getting eaten. This has been happening a lot recently. Before it happens, the enhanced music for the area stops playing (and optionally the midi) after continuing from a death/f6. Then I'd try to save, and it'll let me save, but then when I try to go back in the quest either didn't save my progress or outright cannot find the save file.
This is my saves folder; it's completely blank save for backups and deleted

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) or @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) no clue what would be causing this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/15/2023 16:36

loading up the last backup save (which was 10-ish minutes beforehand) and I haven't run into it again
I think ZC might have been open for a while when it happened?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/15/2023 20:28

(can post the backup saves if it helps)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/15/2023 20:41

Yeah it might

here were the last two backups before I lost the save

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/16/2023 01:03

Doh, should have asked way earlier: can you enable replay and try to get it to happen again? While saving often?
Like, as often as possible

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/16/2023 12:33

can I enable replay on a file that didn't start out as replay?
Yuurand is a bit weird in that it's a consistent save file

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/16/2023 13:54

Okay so I got it to trigger on a new file
the problem is that it didn't save the replay
it saved my death count

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/16/2023 13:58

trying to open any save file gives me this error

and again, I left this ZC window open all night, no clue if that plays into it or not
and it was preceded again by the enhanced music not playing after a continue

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/16/2023 14:07

I'll have to check the memory ZC is using next time it happens; I wonder if there's a memory allocation problem

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/16/2023 22:51

okay, it happened again

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/16/2023 22:52

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/16/2023 23:01

so theory: something about playing enhanced music is causing this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/16/2023 23:50

that log is common all the time fyi

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/16/2023 23:53

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "the problem is that it didn't‚Ä¶"): Every time you do "Save" in end game menu it should save/update a replay
does yuurand not use that?
perhaps I should add it to the scripting Save command

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/16/2023 23:54

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Every time you do "Save" in e‚Ä¶"): oh no, it saves the replay on saves
but whenever it crashes it does not save a replay

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/16/2023 23:54

ah, no it wouldn't. but perhaps continuing from the replay would get us closer to a repro

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/16/2023 23:54

or rather, not crashes
but when I try to save knowing that it'll delete my save file
```Trying to load C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Zelda Classic\Yuurand\WarpSpace.ogg
OGG file 'C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Zelda Classic\Yuurand\WarpSpace.ogg' not loaded.``` it also printed this when it failed to play the music

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/16/2023 23:57

like it seems to be tied to the program being open for a while

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/17/2023 03:47

okay, so I ran into it again
this time I retried instead of saving; the save file didn't get eaten, but still no replay was generated

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/17/2023 03:49

it egnerates replays every time I saved and IIRC making a replay on retry was a thing; it seems like whenever this occurs no replays can be made and I have to restart the program to load any save again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2023 03:51

I feel like retry doesn't generate the replay

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/17/2023 06:10

just confirmed retry does generate the replay when things aren't bugged

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2023 06:33

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "like it seems to be tied to t‚Ä¶"): oh fuck. I do not like the implications of this üò¨

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2023 06:33

moooosh what did you do
where did you memory leak

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/17/2023 06:34

should try leaving it running in an ASAN build
see what is being corrupted
though I know the sound system _period_ always flags on ASAN, so I always run w/ `-s` ... but maybe that's finally come home to roost

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2023 06:45

I've got the big sus on dmap switching. That's the only thing I can think of where music could be doing anything funky. Also have no idea what it could be doing with saves. Unless any crash at all causes save corruption, which would be pretty bad on its own

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2023 06:48

there was something with switching DMaps that I noticed in testing that may be the memory leak, but then I loaded up an older version and it had the same behavior. And then the behavior stopped past a certain point. So my running theory was that this  is just how allegro caches enhanced music or something to that effect. That one's probably not something I screwed up, but could be masking something else I did?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2023 06:49

(replying to @ Moosh "I've got the big sus on dmap‚Ä¶"): If it's a random memory issue it could corrupt *anything*

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2023 07:10

(replying to @ Moosh "there was something with swit‚Ä¶"): Okay nope, I am full of shit. Good news, everybody. I have confirmed that there is indeed a leak üò©

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2023 07:12

okay yeah, this is egregious. Way worse than what I observed before. How in the frick did I not catch this???

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/17/2023 09:46

Just a leak wouldn't result in any problem fyi. Unless it gets used later or double freed

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2023 09:55

Well the leak is at least consistent with Deedee's report. It creeps up and up and up and then when it hits around 2GB, it stops playing any new music. Unsure about the crash

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/17/2023 09:56

Maybe it's this and a combination of not checking that an allocation worked before using its memory...
Deedee on 64bit right?
In which case memory wouldnt really get exhausted, but perhaps an internal music buffer is still full and causes a allegro api call to fail

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2023 09:59

I'm pretty sure that's it. Just not seeing where that buffer is failing to be emptied

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2023 10:51

okay pushed a fix that should solve the memory leak problem. Was pretty straightforward what was wrong, OGG/MP3 music just wasnt destroying audio streams when unloaded. Time (and) Deedee will tell if this fixes the other issue

=== @ Moosh 09/17/2023 10:55

```OGG/MP3 music just wasnt destroying audio streams when unloaded```
not sure it's even right calling that a memory leak, was more of a memory _fountain_

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/17/2023 12:02

memory gusher

=== @ Russ 09/17/2023 16:36

I‚Äôm glad ZC development has gone back to the good ole days of Yuurand global memory corruption panic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2023 16:43

lmao

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/23/2023 02:10

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) have you seen this happen since Moosh's fix landed?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/23/2023 02:31

I have not

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/29/2023 06:27

Tentatively closing this.
