I have all of my swords in my quest set to "can slash" but I am now running into a bizarre problem where swords only stab when testing. The problem might extend to the player itself. I hope that's not the case.

The settings on all the swords in my quest, for reference

what build is this in exactly? (Etc->About report info please)
also it's not the sword setting, it's the init data setting `Can Slash` that would be involved
sword has nothing to do with it
also can you post your `zquest.cfg` contents?

It worked fine in the previous nightly
