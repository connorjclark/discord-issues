The Warp Doll Item Script here: https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=102 softlocks the game if the item has a circular animation.

Wait. I think this problem is only present in my quest.
That's really odd, since I don't remember making any changes to the script.

Well this is the line in my quest script for the circle animation. Wondering if there's anything wrong with the code.
