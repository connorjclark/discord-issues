Scripts can 'Own' things- various pointer types like bitmaps or paldata, as well as the basic ownership of their own local arrays.

Generic scripts are bad owners. They can own something through F6->Continue, which no other type can do- and this is a problem.
Because other types could not do this, the system was not designed with this in mind
Here's a fun example of this problem in action, which shows why it's a critical issue:
```cpp
generic script foo
{
    void run()
    {
        int foo[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
        while(true)
        {
            if(Hero->PressA)
                printf("%ad\n",foo);
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```

...The first output looks correct.
Then I F6->Continued and tried again
and got the second output
...which, here, appears to be the string literal `%ad\n` itself being printed
(if that weren't there, it would give an invalid array error instead)
.....this needs to be fixed.
The causal location here is in zelda.cpp:

that needs to not deallocate on ANY exit, but instead only non-continue exits
and then continue-exits need to deallocate all types that are dead on continue, which is everything EXCEPT generic scripts- and also SOME generic scripts, depending on their exit and reload state settings.
@ Moosh so uh this was what was fucking with stuff mostly
