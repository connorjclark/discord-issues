A flag to turn on for the spin attack, hurricane spin, quake hammer, and super quake to make it so that the damage multiplier adds to the power instead.

Also maybe being able to get both the multiplying and adding to the cross beam damage, with an added option of being tied to the sword's beam damage instead of it's own damage.
