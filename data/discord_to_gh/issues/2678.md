September 20th nightly. Whenever I use my last bomb, my sword stops working until I save/retry. It's still shown on the passive subscreen, but it's like I'm jinxed. Included is the quest I notice it happening. I have white sword, boomerang, bow/arrows, bracelet, blue candle, raft, and ladder, if it helps.

I just ran into this too ü´†
when playing hero of dreams

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I'm guessing this is related to recent subscreen changes, any idea where to look?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 06:31

something to do with the item button stuff
which is uh...
I'm guessing due to the bombs, somehow related to `deselectbombs`
(for the record, the item button subscreen stuff related to bombs has had various bugs for YEARS, and we pretty much never fixed them... I think my rewrite fixed some of them)

Can't seem to reproduce.
Deedee were you using a gamepad?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/03/2023 02:22

Can't repro in 117 either (Which is where I initially saw it). I was recording a replay but due to a bug w/ saves it didn't catch the bug üò¶

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/03/2023 02:30

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Deedee were you using a gamep‚Ä¶"): nope

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/03/2023 03:44

I don't yet know how it would happen, but looking at the code ... https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/main/src/zc/hero.cpp#L10240-L10245
Adding a similar conditional to that last `else` block might fix it?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 22:05

Before closing this, I'm gonna play a couple full games (Lost Isle / Ocarina of Power) over the next week or so.
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) if you play anything, make sure to be recording in case it happens again

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/07/2023 22:10

alright

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 05:12

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) did you ever see this again?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2023 11:43

I have not
but also I haven't played any quests with bombs since

=== @ Phosphor 10/31/2023 19:59

A friend of mine (not really involved with the ZC scene but is familiar with it and has played a few quests in the past) also experienced this not too long ago playing BoaB using the September 21st nightly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 20:00

Thanks, but that's too old for us to be confident it still exists :/
I really wish replays didn't happen to be broken the one time I saw this.
It cut off just before the bug lol

Maybe this test quest I just fabricated in a single minute is too simplistic to try to reproduce this bug, but I wasn't able to find the bug in question with it.  

I started a new quest file, went into Init data, gave myself a max 4 bombs AND the 4 bomb ammo, and the sword, went in-game, used up all four bombs, and was able to slash the sword just fine.

And I did have to select the bombs first.  Didn't have to do that in Hero of Dreams though.
That was too early to have selectable items, I'd wager.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/01/2023 15:03

Possible conditions to test:
1. Does it happen when using the three default subscreens? (Z1, New, New 2)
2. Does it happen only after getting Super Bombs?
3. Does it happen only after getting a bomb upgrade room or bomb bag, things that change your bomb max?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/14/2023 09:26

I haven't noticed it since but it's possible I'm just not playing the right quests
