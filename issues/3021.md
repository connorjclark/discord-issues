I'm not actually sure if this is a bug or expected behaviour.

Push blocks with screen flag 67 placed on it will retain it when pushed, but the flag will also remain on the previous combo it was located on.

Extra context in regards to setup: Screen uses Layer 3 below everything for detailing, and the undercombo is transparent. Push blocks are on layer 0.

I don't think this got tagged?

Is "Block Triggers improved locking" QR off for you? I think if on it would remove the flag. I just glanced at the code, did not test.
