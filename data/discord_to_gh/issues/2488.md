In short I would like options to enable/disable different things that pop up in the right click menu when you click on a screen. As it stands, it is very crowded (taking up about half the vertical space on a screen when editing it). While I do think having access to the settings in the right click menu is helpful I think it would be better if we could enable/disable each dropdown (e.g. have a tickbox in the settings to display the Draw Block dropdown, one for the Brush Settings dropdown, etc.). A lot of the settings in the right click menu are ones that I do not change very often (namely, Set Fill Type, Brush Settings, and Draw Block, as the first one isn't very useful to change, and the latter two have been superceded by better combo placement features imo). I also do not use the Screen dropdown in the right click menu, as that can already be accessed by other menus.

To elaborate, the right click menu also has to go up really far if you right click on a combo near the bottom of the screen. This is better than options not being able to be accessed, but since I don't use ~half the stuff there, it would be nice if I could make it less crowded so this isn't as pronounced.
