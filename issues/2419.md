The title, really

I requested this forever ago

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/06/2023 22:25

I.... had to double check that this wasn't a thing because I swore it was already
but, nope, it's just not

=== @ vlamart 06/06/2023 22:27

It's one of those hardcoded sprite IDs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/06/2023 22:27

yeah
I added the way to modify which ID it uses for the hardcode, but not per-combo
or wait no I didn't
I only added the fucking SFX
not the sprite
wow
that's 2 things I thought I fucking did here that I apparently didn't
...and even then that's only the grass CUT sfx
yeah this is just pain
(should be fairly easy to add, though a bit tedious.)

thank you

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2023 15:26

i wonder if FX ought to be a per-combo thing since it might be neat to make conveyor combos have water FX

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2023 15:37

or at least an option on conveyor combos

=== @ vlamart 06/07/2023 15:45

Can conveyers be layers with liquid to push you while swimming?

=== @ P-Tux7 06/07/2023 19:42

Oh, I was just thinking rapids that were conveyors with a shallow water effect. But that might indeed be possible.

=== @ vlamart 06/07/2023 20:06

I was thinking like waterfalls or harsh currents
