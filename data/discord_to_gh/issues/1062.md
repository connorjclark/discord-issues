Here's a "super serious" bug I noticed recently. If you collect a tunic and then touch the Zelda flag without saving, the game icon doesn't update to reflect your tunic color. Everything else in the quest appears to be saved though. Would it be possible to make it so the credits sequence works the same as a normal save, possibly with a quest rule in case people want to keep this behavior to verify a 0 save game?
Here's an example quest showcasing the behavior

@ DeletedUser Are people in the 0 game or speedrunning scenes making use of this bug do you know?

=== @ NightmareJames 09/30/2021 22:25

Not AFAIK, but good that we caught it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2021 12:36

Just bashed my head against this bug for a solid half hour
and made no progress whatsoever
I have no idea why the icon isn't saving, but nothing I changed worked....

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 10:40

I suspect cause it's reading the ring from zinitdata and not gamedata; I think the former might be invalid by the time the ending rolls around?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/09/2022 10:47

don't touch this code right now
I'm touching things that might conflict
(will try to push this soon so it's free)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/09/2022 10:52

well, my initial fix attempt did a bunch of spooky SFX playing and didn't fix it, so I'm guessing my fix accessed random memory somehow
discarded
But I did trace it and confirm that it's not finding any rings... despite you clearly having rings

=== @ NightmareJames 02/09/2022 21:19

Lovely

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:00

Found the solution
```load_game_icon(game,false,currgame);``` 
```load_game_icon(saves+currgame,false,currgame);``` Changing game to saves_currgame fixed it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:04

This was a giant pain to figure out
tiny little error in a haystack.

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 07:09

```saves+currgame```
Dare I ask what this is?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:10

oh

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:10

currgame is an int pointing to the save slot id

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:10

`saves` is an array

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:10

and saves is an array

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:10

so `saves+currgame` is the same as `&(saves[currgame])`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:11

Don't ask me *how* that works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:11

a pointer to the `currgame`th element of the array

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:11

it's black voodoo magic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:11

in this case, it's a pointer to the save file of the current quest
as opposed to the current game object
What line is this on?
I can probably explain more detail

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:12

3 different lines in ending.cpp, and the exact lines might not be the same cause I added a bit more code to debug and clean up
656?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:12

oh
is it the one in `inc_quest`?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:12

in ending()

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:13

hmm, then I'm confused

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893241534588268574/941955102967750686/unknown.png?ex=65ec0c0d&is=65d9970d&hm=db208bcb66be3b88d1bb1037ed371592a1ac994d4ce47d4fa44489a06eee24f0&)
That is copying `game` to `saves[currgame]`
and then calling those functions

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 07:13

That's kinda what I figured was up, but adding arbitrary offsets to a pointer scares me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:14

Adding to a pointer offsets by the added value times the number of bytes that the type of the array takes up
so a `byte[]`, doing `+ 2` is `+ 2 bytes`
an `int32_t[]`, doing `+2` is `+ 8  bytes`
because `sizeof(int32_t) == 4`
And if say, you have an `itemdata[]`, then it offsets by several hundred bytes per value added
or, for instance, `tmpscr+1` is used often
to access the pointer to `tmpscr[1]`

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 07:15

But if you go over the size of the array it'll access random memory, yeah?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:15

Yep!

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 07:15

fun

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:15

But I mean, same happens if you go over the size in the normal way

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:15

technically I odn't think it's random memory?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:15

`tmpscr[50]` is gonna be very random
but `tmpscr+50` is equally bad

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:15

It's whatever the next thing declared is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:15

It isn't necessarily random
but it very well could be

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:16

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:16

like, an example:

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:16

it's "who the fuck knows" memory

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:17

this is in `gamedata`
If I access `lvlitems[512]`, that's always going to give me `lvlkeys[0]`
(`MAXLEVELS` being `512`)
This is the end of gamedata
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893241534588268574/941956307475382272/unknown.png?ex=65ec0d2c&is=65d9982c&hm=2bf1a0ef8cded4ce373841db117f23e267b01bae67b2d36fce6cf8c8319a95c3&)
If I tried to access....
`bottleSlots[276]`
that would be random
`bottleSlots[274]` and `[275]` would be the two bytes that make up `portalspr`
but [276] goes past the end of the struct
so it would be whatever memory was allocated next, which could vary widely.

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 07:21

And the compiler doesn't warn you when doing any of this?

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 07:22

I guess it doesn't in ZScript either. But the ZScript console is at least kind enough to yell at me and also catch the errors before I access anything catastrophic

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:27

(replying to @ Moosh "And the compiler doesn't warn‚Ä¶"): nope
lmao

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:35

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) what should I mark a thread as where a fix hasn't been posted yet but it has been fixed?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 07:54

Check if the fix is tested/confirmed, pill if it still needs to be tested
doesn't matter if the fix is posted or not, same regardless

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/12/2022 07:55

Okay
(meta) thread name was changed: üíäüîìZelda flag not updating game icons
