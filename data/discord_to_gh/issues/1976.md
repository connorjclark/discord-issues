Yeah, it's exactly as the title describes. Emily could explain it better than I can and she ran into this while doing some GUI work regarding the combo screen and help captions

hitting a `?` button in a scroll pane
when the `?` info panel closes, the scrollpane scrolls up
`position_mouse_z(0)` was not helpful

`position_mouse_z(0)` was not helpful, because it was the fucking problem
fixed
