The tabs in ZCL and ZQ now lag for around a second each time I click between them in ZCL and ZQ.
In versions prior to the Allegro 5 GUI stuff clicking tabs loaded their contents instantly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/10/2023 10:47

clearly there's some optimizations to be done
....though this is also definitely PC dependant, as I can click and drag across an entire set of tabs, switching between all of them, each one loading instantly just fine.

=== @ cbailey78 03/10/2023 16:55

That sounds pretty unfortunate to me, I cannot afford a new computer and I had this laptop since 2011.

=== @ cbailey78 03/10/2023 17:16

Unfortunately, I'll have to stick to Nightly 2023-02-24 which was the last build that had no lag until optimizations are done.

@ Orithan @ cbailey78 try latest nightly

=== @ cbailey78 03/11/2023 18:10

Just did and it works smoothly for me now. 😀

=== @ cbailey78 03/11/2023 18:11

It sure was like trying to play a heavy PS5 game on an old windows 3.1 machine.

=== @ Orithan 03/11/2023 22:03

I am still getting performance issues, though not quite as badly

=== @ Moosh 03/16/2023 00:04

Just chiming in on this, I've got my own share of lag in ZQuest. When I use the OpenGL driver, changing tabs takes several seconds. It's actually unusable, even 1.92 runs faster than this somehow. Are you using OpenGL or Direct3D @ Orithan

=== @ Moosh 03/16/2023 00:05

Direct3D works better for me, though it still has that odd issue where it freezes up my entire monitor for about a second when changing tabs between ZQuest and something else

=== @ Orithan 03/16/2023 00:39

Makes no difference for me

=== @ Moosh 03/16/2023 00:41

okay cool, so whatever my issue is it's completely different from yours then. Fuuuun

=== @ Entropy 03/29/2023 01:51

Chiming in to say i'm experiencing a problem that may or may not be related to this.

Linux Mint, as usual

A lot of windows seem to need several seconds to open, and freeze the program until they do so. This happens in both Zelda.exe and ZQuest.

Oddly, some windows seem to not be affected by this, and load instantly.

Some examples--
*Zelda.exe* - 
Only, as far as I can tell, the Video Mode... window and the confirmation windows for the debuggers have lag. Everything else loads instantly.

*Zquest.exe* - 
The "This is an alpha" warning takes a while to pop up, and causing a black screen until it does. 

The "compile script" window has lag. The buffer itself loads instantly. The "save changes to buffer" window loads instantly, but actually clicking the buttons lags. The "compile success/failure" button takes a while to come up, but the "Assign compiled script" window doesn't. The "successfully loaded into script slots" window lags. The "Init Script Changed" window took a *really* long time (more than ~20 seconds?) to become responsive.

This is, of course, not every possible window, so if more info is needed i'll be happy to provide it.

This did not happen in Alpha 112, and only started upon updating to the nightlies.

=== @ Entropy 03/29/2023 23:46

Switching to openGL cut the lag. it's still present but it feels like it's better.

=== @ Moosh 03/30/2023 02:21

And it doesn't lag in different places? Like when changing tabs?

=== @ Entropy 03/30/2023 03:20

it does
sorry

=== @ Orithan 04/01/2023 01:12

Okay in the later nightlies, most of this has been fixed due to most of the recent A5 UI changes being reverted
ZCL still lags the heck out and I am still seeing lag in the item editor

=== @ Orithan 04/10/2023 06:08

Been digging in and found a few sections that are troublesome:
ZCL as a whole (super laggy)
``Quest->Options`` (super laggy)
Combo Editor
Script Rules
FFCs
Item Editor
Init Data
The rest seem to work almost perfectly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/10/2023 06:16

weird

=== @ Orithan 04/10/2023 06:26

Others I thought would lag like the enemy editor and screen data don't

=== @ Orithan 04/10/2023 07:43

Added Init Data, FFCs, Script Rules and Combo Editor to the list

=== @ Orithan 04/10/2023 07:49

All of these except FFCs load in a ton of stuff. I fail to see how FFCs tank the rendering pipeline

=== @ cbailey78 04/10/2023 16:23

(replying to @ Orithan "All of these except FFCs load…"): The Palette -> Levels are laggy as hell too, the Palettes -> Main works perfectly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/10/2023 16:33

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> y'all are listing new dialog system dialogs as bad and old dialog system dialogs as good

=== @ Orithan 04/10/2023 23:37

I thought enemy editor was new and FFCs were old dialouge

=== @ Orithan 04/10/2023 23:38

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "<:nekoSigh:101218768046707509…"): Something happened to that rendering pipeline recently

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/10/2023 23:50

(replying to @ Orithan "I thought enemy editor was ne…"): nope, those are backwards

=== @ Orithan 04/10/2023 23:53

I'll go and pinpoint exactly where it started

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/10/2023 23:57

I'll bet you it's the A5 draws on the window and tabpane
.....That shouldn't cause anything in particular *when switching tabs*, I wouldn't think....

=== @ Orithan 04/11/2023 00:54

I noticed a certain amount of delay when opening those dialogues. Is the rendering tree reloading the whole thing when you switch tabs?

=== @ Orithan 04/11/2023 01:02

Specifically, this started with the 26th Feb nightly.

=== @ Orithan 04/11/2023 01:13

The 25th Feb nightly has the A5 map drawing and still runs perfectly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2023 01:24

(replying to @ Orithan "I noticed a certain amount of…"): When you switch tabs, no.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2023 01:25

New dialog system dialogs (a5 rewrite or no- so this is the same for like 1.5 years ish now) DO have to entirely reconstruct the dialog when it OPENS- which is why dialogs such as Quest Rules Search take a long time to initially open (generating all of those checkboxes takes a moment)
but switching tabs should do fucking nothing

=== @ Orithan 04/11/2023 01:27

Strange
It's taking roughly the same amount of time to switch tabs as it does to open the dialogue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2023 01:29

yeah, it has no excuse to be doing that. This entire lag issue is "strange".

=== @ Orithan 04/11/2023 01:30

Something happened in the 26th Feb nightly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2023 01:39

The 25th feb is fine?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/11/2023 01:41

....oh
well, yeah, that timing makes sense I guess
<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>
I'm probably gonna step away from dev for a bit (a week or so) just to get some energy back up. This is gonna take a lot of energy to dig into.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 07:42

@ Orithan test latest nightly?

=== @ Moosh 04/16/2023 07:49

It seems to be running better for me now. Heck yeah! OpenGL is back on the menu!

=== @ Orithan 04/16/2023 07:54

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Orithan test la…"): It's been fixed as far as I can see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 07:54

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> for fucks sake I hate everything
that was far too simple and should not have taken me that long
