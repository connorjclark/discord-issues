A specific script in Yuurand is chugging my game to a crawl in 2.55; I isolated the cause to a massive nested for loop, but I was confused cause I certainly didn't notice this in 2.53. So I simplified the script and compared the fps in a clean default quest in both 2.53 and 2.55; the script runs only if I am holding either Ex1 or Ex2. In 2.53, I get 1000 FPS uncapped with the script off, and 200 with it on. In 2.55, I get 4000 FP uncapped with it off, and... 200 with it on. Something doesn't feel right. 

Attached are the test quest and script; the default quest in 2.53 was Zelda 1 so I put the ffc script on the starting screen (Map 1, Screen 77). The script runs if either Ex1 or Ex2 are held.

We made many improvements to the rendering, but none to the zscript bytecode interpeter. So it isn't odd that a heavy script is still slow - it is ~200 FPS in both because the bottle neck is def. not the rendering there.

BTW, with jit on, there is no drop in FPS. Inspected the generated assembly it's obv. because the loop is optimized away by the JIT assembler since it does nothing.
I'll have it do something trivial with the variables and see if the slowdown is still at least lest drastic.

```
void SetFloatSolidity(bool Set){
    int i; int j; int k; int l; //Again, ZC is irresponsible and it's less memory to declare all these counters here
    for(k = 0; k<3; k++){
        for(i = 0; i < 176; i++){ //Loop through all combos
            for(l = 0; l<2; l++){ //Rather than reduplicate the following code block five times, let's put it all in a for loop
                //CurrentArray = ComboArrays[l]; //ZC doesn't have true 2D arrays, but making an int and setting it's value to the pointer of another array works just fine
                for(j = 0; j<7; j++){ //Loop through all combos in this array
                     if (i + j + k + l == 1231) {
                       printf("L = %d, J = %d", l, j);
                     }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Yeah it drops hardly 10% uncapped w/ JIT but crawls w/o JIT.
Closing... eventually I'll get to enable JIT by default once it can be made to never halt the main game loop. Then everything will be fast forever
