The screenshot I'm about to post should clarify what I'm talking about. I've been noticing weird enemy spawn positions in a few screens in my side project.

So far I'm seeing it happen on screens with "enemies enter from the side - random" and one instance of "random spawn"

Second instance of this, thanks for reporting in a different quest @ FireSeraphim
