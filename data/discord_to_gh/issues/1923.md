An invisible FFC placed on map screens are impossible to see and can sometimes get forgotten about or lost while searching on screen endlessly just to delete one or edit it.

When choosing the Flags option flags are displayed by color. FFC should be displayed with a Green or Purple color outline around them, where-ever a FFC is placed on screen, allowing developers in ZC to actually see where FFC's are placed on a Map screen and edit or remove them from screens.

just use the ffc menu
`Screen->Freeform Combos` or `F7`

It does not show the location of an FFC hidden on screem and takes hours to find the FFC to delete it
Then there should be a delete FFC button ability in that case.

it tells you
the X/Y position
of the ffc
and you can edit those to move it
for instance, you could set both to 0
and then the FFC would be in the top left of the screen

i will check this out hold on

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2022 06:29

or you could not make FFCs invisible
You can set both these flags:

if both of those are checked, the FFC will be invisible in-game

Ohh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2022 06:30

then you can make it visible in ZQ by setting it a visible combo
I usually have a combo that has the text `FFC` on it in a gray color

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/27/2022 06:30

Oh ok
i just realized you can edit X Y position also looking
i did not know this
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "You can set both these flags:"): Where in rules is that located?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2022 06:32

that's in the FFC editor

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/27/2022 06:32

Oh ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/27/2022 06:32

for the ffc

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/27/2022 06:32
