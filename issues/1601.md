Some quests don`t need subscreen at all. Hitting Enter should count as Pause.

I feel like this would be easy enough to script that adding it as a quest rule would be weird

An active subscreen script as follows would do this:```cpp
dmapdata script PauseSubscreen
{
    void run()
    {
        do Waitframe(); until(Hero->PressStart);
    }
}```
