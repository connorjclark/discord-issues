Okay, so.
A lot of things GUI-wise are kind of a mess
Enemy editor is a massive sin right now

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 04:21

Attributes 11 and 12 got moved to a new attributes page... for some reason? And all the new attributes are all the way over in a completely different supertab that's all the way on the other side of the editor
(meta) thread name was changed: GUI Rearrangement Suggestions

First off:

Which arrangement is preferable: Name first, Edit after, or Edit first, Name after?

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 04:26

name first, edit after makes sense to me

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 04:26

Alright

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 04:27

Consistent with item editor as well
Never really occurred to me that these ones are different but yeah, they shouldn't be

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 04:30

Also question why Size is in Basic when it's not a commonly used (or finished?) feature

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 04:33

Move flags could probably be relocated under flags though I'm not super against it being its own thing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 04:48

Keep in mind the enemy editor needs to be converted to new gui system
Which means completely rewriting it anyway
Re-arranging things in the old system is a bit of a waste

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 04:50

True that

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 04:50

need to get on that at some point...

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 04:51

Though the old one has some good stuff the new could reuse. I'm very fond of the layout of the first page in particular

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 04:52

Well, the new gui system works entirely differently
The old one has everything hardcoded to an x/y
Instead of being, like, formatted

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 04:54

Right, but the new one can't do stuff like that? Arranging things in a specific layout. I appreciate having enemy tiles in the top left, stats in the middle, movement data on the right, and animations at the bottom. All the most important stuff within arms reach and contained to their own parts of the screen. It's compact and comfy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 04:56

its' more blocky of a layout
so, it needs to be re-built from scratch in a new system regardless
taking general ideas from the old one, aye
but not a single piece of the code from the old one helps
the code has to be entirely redone
the most helpful the old one could be is a reference screenshot

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 04:58

well yeah, I was talking about reusing ideas, not the code :/
This whole discussion is about that in the first place. How the thing should be structured

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 04:59

also keep in mind that it won't be the same *size* as the old one
large mode can support a hell of a lot larger of a dialog
and the new system can special-handle small mode to keep it working

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 05:04

I think Emily has been hinting to me "hey, please do the enemy DLG so I don't have to", so
(replying to @ Moosh "Though the old one has some g‚Ä¶"): I can certainly try
but no promises
new system is built on a row by row, column by column basis

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:06


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909658686069301248/909670674400944158/unknown.png?ex=65e556d5&is=65d2e1d5&hm=f654a7370a4f3817be0a174e359d2428b5f35be5922181bfaf28451b8e7b8bd9&)
keep in mind that this is a possible shape
because, this is a column, of rows

=== @ Moosh 11/15/2021 05:06

And you can't have some of them be empty to structure things different?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:06

aye, that doesn't make defining all the spacing easy
and it's not so simple to take something and move it a couple pixels to the side

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 05:50

I've been trying to figure out how to start a new enemy dlg and I'm clueless where to begin or what would be a good place to start

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 05:50

Every dialog thus far, I just start with the first tab
make a new dialog file, duplicating an old one
clear out the `Window()` constructor from it
and any other junk you don't want
then start building the window constructor again
start with a TabPanel, with it's different TabRefs
Give any empty tabrefs a `DummyWidget()` as their content, to display them as empty tabs
and start building a tab

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/15/2021 07:20

I'm too intimidated by making a new enemy GUI üò¢
