The offset from Screen->Quake screws up draws sometimes. Good example being scripted subscreens. Since they freeze the screen, all draws are offset by whatever the quake offset was for that frame, which is really noticeable and awkward. It'd be nice if we could read the current offset in ZScript to counteract the effect
