Something I've noticed in particular with large enemies. Turned on all fixes, tried `Use 'scripted movement' for engine movement`, neither seemed to work. In the test quest hold R to get the enemy unstuck. If you keep holding R and attack it, sometimes knockback will also clip it into the left wall

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) any particular reason gravity and knockback shouldn't be considered "engine movement" for the purpose of that movement flag? I'm fairly sure them using your smarter movement code would fix these issues

uhh
that would be too smart for me
