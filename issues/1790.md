This is kinda a frivolous suggestion but I remember there being rooms in in ALTTP with multiple unlit torches and each torch lit up in those rooms brighten up those room progressively. Ideally this would also take into account comboes that only stay lit for a limited amount of time before turning into an unlit torch combo as well.

Doesn't really work well, due to palette restrictions

I kinda thought the allegro 5 update would have partially solved that... Oh well.

We CAN change palette restrictions with A5, on a TECHNICAL level
but, doing so will break all old quests, and break existing scripts
so, it simply can't be done until 'rewrite'
