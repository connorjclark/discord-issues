looks ok when windowed, but the screen "tiles" are offset when ZQ is set to full screen, either via `etc->fullscreen` or just maximising the window. latest windows nightly (6-12)

the black tiles also appear when you use zq snapshot in windowed. second one is just a screen capture with sharex, looks perfectly fine idk
