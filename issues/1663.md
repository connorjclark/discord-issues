mac build is ready
https://hoten.cc/files/ZeldaClassic.dmg
(meta) thread name was changed: Mac build - please provide initial bug reports & feedback here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/06/2022 00:50

Note: on first run, you will get a warning about the app being "from the scary internet". Just hit OK, and it won't show again.

To insert your own data to where Zelda Classic can easily find it, you can `Right Click -> Show Package Contents`, then put anything you want as normal in the `Contents/Resources` folder.

which version did you port over

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/06/2022 00:57

This is currently the latest code but minus a few commits. I'll update to the very latest right now.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/06/2022 01:20

It's the very latest now.

probably not a mac build bug per-se. I didn't see a UI scale option in the launcher. The UI elements are super small

not even a bug, just a complaint really.

So in fullscreen of the player, I'm having a hell of a time handling the cursor. Basically I think the cursor is maybe mapped to a bigger area. So I can see the cursor fly passed the screen sometimes as I'm moving it around

=== @ colin 06/07/2022 07:58

Doesn't appear to always be the case. I'll see if I can get reproduction steps tomorrow when I have more of a chance

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/07/2022 08:03

resolution: isn't it this option?

the biggest isn't very big though, I can add more sizes

the mouse thing: I believe I fixed that in the latest version, try re-downloading

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/07/2022 08:05

The "resolution" option should probably be re-worked though. One doesn't really want the resolution of the game to be bigger (b/c the UI elements become really small)... but instead, the window should just scale everything up to fit the window. I'll look into it

=== @ colin 06/08/2022 03:06

on resolution, I'm referring specifically to UI scale. So at 1600x1200, the UI of the player is unusably small since it is smaller relative to the resolution
yeah, exactly as you said

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/08/2022 04:12

I think it's more pronounced on Mac because of the higher DPR. You and I are probably both on a two DPR monitor. With windows, the pixels don't take into account DPR so they scale better. Got to research this more

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/26/2022 01:06

Updated Mac version. Just getting the latest code from the last few weeks, no specific changes to mac version.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/28/2022 04:26

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I think it's more pronounced…"): Could this at all be related to Orithan's scaling problems in the windows AL5 builds?

Great port! I'm playing on a MacBook Pro M1 Max on Monterey 12.4 and I'm not sure why but on Link's Birthday DX it freezes after playing for an hour or so. I play for a while and then, just after it finishes scrolling between screens, it'll freeze hard. No mouse response, no keyboard response. It's only the zelda window that freezes. The ZLauncher window stays responsive but I cannot close either without force-quitting the zelda process. This is the only quest I've tried so far so I don't know if it's just this particular quest or all of them.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/05/2022 19:01

@ carnch there's been a lot of changes recently, can you let me know if you see the same freezes in the latest versions? BTW, you must go to GitHub (link in #deleted-channel ) now as I am no longer updating the above link

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 23:42
