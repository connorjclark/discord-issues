Gleeok HP is supposedly higher in pre-2.11 builds. I need to check this out later.

Oh goddamn you. I'll check it out for 2.10 but I think we'll just have to trust that it's whatever 2.10 uas for quests all the way from 1.00 through 2.10 because the source code record is spotty such as not including 1.77, 1.84, 1.90 and maybe 1.92
I'll check out Fire Gleeoks too
