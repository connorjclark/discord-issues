After you click Okay in the assign slots window, no window is active until slots finish assigning and the completion window pops up. This might be confusing for people cause you can't actually do anything while the slots are still being assigned.

...I think my commit I just did for fixing the flicker in that dialog should fix this? @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
