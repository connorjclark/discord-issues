Currently ZC supports multiple types of black opening wipe (also used by Entrance/Exit combos). These include rectangles from the sides (Z1), Circle, Oval (LTTP), spinning Triangle, and Super Mario All-Stars (tiles).

However, they're set up to work quest-wide with quest rules. It would be neat to be able to set each specific warp to use a specific type of fade. (also to be able to do it without relying on entrance/exit combo warps specifically would be nice, since those mess with continue points). Perhaps a fade in / fade out option on each warp combo somehow? Whatever works.

^sfx too

ooooh yes, a sfx that doesn't get interrupted by the warp would be awesome

Reviving this one to add some additional ideas.

- The "static"-y effect from the darkness dithering which clears the screen
- A black rectangle that covers the screen from left to right.

also I didn't clarify this before, but it would be really neat to be able to manually set a fade-in for arriving at a warp, so that you can have it fade out when you leave, then reliably fade in when you arrive (currently this only works on certain kinds of warps, I think maybe Entrance/Exit warps or caves?).
