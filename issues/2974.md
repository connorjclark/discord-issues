I understand the map display in ZQ can't break any palette rules, but can the file saving use each screen's individual palette?

Been wanting to try doing this for awhile
Remind me if I haven't updated this thread sometime this weekend.

(replying to @ mitchfork "I understand the map display…"): I mean, the ZQ display most certainly can break palette rules, just see the minimap

=== @ mitchfork 01/11/2024 04:56

in that case extend the request to that haha

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/11/2024 05:03

it basically needs to be converted to an a5 bitmap

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/15/2024 02:51

Done

=== @ mitchfork 01/15/2024 03:00

cool!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/15/2024 03:04

Does the palette display in the corner (press.... D?) serve any purpose?
maybe V?
idk keep pressing shit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/15/2024 03:05

which display? zc or zq?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/15/2024 03:05

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/15/2024 03:05

The preview renders each screen in the palette its defined in, but theres this pal grid in the corner that is just whatever palete was opened in.
No, the map view.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/15/2024 03:06

oh
yeah it's D, I see
probably not needed anymore since the palette is different

=== @ mitchfork 01/15/2024 03:22

did not even know this existed
