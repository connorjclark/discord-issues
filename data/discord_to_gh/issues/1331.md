You know how, at first, the tile editor's mode of using the shift key to select multiple tiles allows you to select a box-shaped formation of tiles?

Well, if you press space to change that to the line-by-line selection mode, the cursor will usually disappear, leaving you to use the tile preview in the bottom left corner to guess where your current position is. 😬 

Upon further testing on tile page 0, the cause of the bug might have been found: it seems that the cursor is simply being drawn at position (column number, tile number) instead of (column number, row number). 🤷‍♂️

....OH
For FUCKS
SAKE
```cpp
#define TILEROW(tile)        (tile/TILES_PER_ROW)```
That's a nice macro, right?
So like, `TILEROW(9)` -> `(9/20)` -> `0`, as tile 9 is in row 0
now like
`TILEROW(i-first)`
-> `(i-first/20)`
-> `i - (first/20)`
wrong fucking maaaath
