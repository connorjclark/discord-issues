Flags:
Kill When Below Screen: The rock dies when it is no longer visible. This is to allow for enemies that summon falling rocks without them looping around the screen.

Attributes:
Sound: The sound to play once when it bounces.
Bounce Height: How high it bounces. Fake Z-axis if that rule is off, real Z-axis if it's on.
(meta) thread name was changed: Rock and Boulder Attributes
