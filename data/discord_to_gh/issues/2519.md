I'm using the latest nightly and I am seeing the following in the string editor:
All instances of String->Next that were present from loading a quest from an earlier build have been jumbled.
All instances on String->Next that are set goes to different strings.
This appears to be similar to https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1126790517351514165/1126790517351514165

It appears to just break strings I've openend in the string editor

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 09:54

I started looking into this by just opening a random quest (hero of dreams), and saw this:

so i'll work on that first

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 09:56

wait maybe that quest just doesnt have engine strings
anyway, @ Orithan please give me a qst file for quicker testing.

=== @ Orithan 07/14/2023 10:17

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I started looking into this b…"): HoD uses engine strings

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2023 01:31

for HoD.qst the strings are loaded in memory fine, but this caching bit of the strings dialog is broken

still trying to understand what this does
but it always just gives me the first string (None)
ok so at some point we made it possible to rearrange these strings
but this older quest has an index of 0 for every string

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2023 01:37

ok we are overwriting the listpos with 0 via `MsgStrings[i].copyAll(tempMsgString);`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2023 01:41

Fixed that bug.

@ Orithan can you provide examples from the qst you gave me? I'm not sure how to tell something is wrong here.

=== @ Orithan 07/15/2023 01:46

The first few strings

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2023 01:48

Like these?

=== @ Orithan 07/15/2023 01:48

String 3 is supposed to continue to String 4, it instead continues to String 2

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2023 01:49

(replying to @ Orithan "String 3 is supposed to conti…"): Huh, that's what I'm seeing right now.
3 -> 4

=== @ Orithan 07/15/2023 01:49

In game it goes from String 3 to String 2

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2023 01:49

Well, I see that in the ZQuest UI.
You are talking about in game?

=== @ Orithan 07/15/2023 01:49

Yes
String 5 is supposed to go to String 6 as in the editor. It instead goes to String 3 ingame

=== @ Orithan 07/15/2023 01:52

Strings with the BSZ Font have been opened in this build and thus are the ones which are affected

=== @ Orithan 07/15/2023 02:01

Alright, here's an example of ``All instances of String->Next that were present from loading a quest from an earlier build have been jumbled.``:
String 38 goes to String 39 ingame before I edit the string. When you load the string in ZQ, it shows up as going to String 42

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2023 02:03

I believe the string editor is the bug here.

=== @ Orithan 07/15/2023 02:03

It still goes to String 39 after I edit it and don't touch the String->Next

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2023 02:04

We are turning the index chosen N .... into the string at position N in the String GUI

=== @ Orithan 07/15/2023 02:04

If I try to fix the String->Next and send it to String 39 in the editor, it goes to String 36 ingame

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2023 02:06

Fixed.

=== @ Orithan 07/15/2023 02:10

Thanks

=== @ Orithan 07/15/2023 07:07

Confirmed fixed in the newest nightly
However clicking ``Next in List`` in the string editor still apparently uses the offset.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 00:00

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) could you handle the next part here? ^

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 03:56

err, so what exactly is the desired change here?
this string shit is confusing as hell and always has been

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 04:06

Next in List is broken.
Using cached/listpos instead of actual index iirc
Just like the change I made

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 04:20

Given that it's `Next in List`, it feels like listpos would be the intended behavior?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 04:21

Is it meant to follow the Next link?
@ Orithan might have expected this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 04:26

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Is it meant to follow the Nex…"): the question of what is MEANT to happen here is a great one
it's confusing as fuck

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2023 04:26

Since it is next to the Next dropdown
I'd say the name of the label sucks
And it going to the string that is Next is useful
While going to the next in listpos is not

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 04:28

except usually
the listpos is used to order strings that you would want to `Next in List` each other
that's like, most of the point of it, is to group sets of strings that are related, without needing to rearranage their IDs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2023 04:32

...perhaps the issue is, that dropdown shows in ID order?
obviously the dropdown order should match the button right next to it, regardless
and if they don't one of the two is a problem
