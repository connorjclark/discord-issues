Emily i finally got the quest i have been asking Daniel to create so you can fix the bug.*

Here is the test quest

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/20/2022 20:45

Emily,  I think this quest I sent you doesn‚Äôt produce the same crash as mine and others,  can you ask the others for a fresh quest with their scripts that crashes after they finish the compile? I think the one I sent wasn‚Äôt correct.

@ DergerSwerson @ SkyLizardGirl @ vlamart @ FireSeraphim nightly being posted with an *attempt* at a fix.
Let me know the results

I think some of it works.
I compiled Moosh's "Switches" script, assigned all of the FFC script slots from it, and got this casual box.  I hit "Header," and ZQuest instantly crashed to desktop.

Though previously it'd just CTD earlier, so it's progress at least.
If I hit OK, it's fine.
... wait, no it's not.  If I hit OK _the first time_ instead of Header, it went perfectly fine back to ZQuest and I could keep working.

If I hit "Y" again, and Compile, and don't actually assign any scripts again and just straight-up hit OK without doing anything, THEN it crashes instantly.  Wow.

=== @ vlamart 09/26/2022 08:48

That latter is exactly what was happening to me before. I'll check this nightly in the morning

=== @ vlamart 09/26/2022 11:48

Tested compiling with no changes or assignments to the scripts, crashes. Tried with changes in the script and not assigning any new scripts, crashes. Tried changes and assigning/reassigning them, still crashes. I might just have a bad quest or something

=== @ DergerSwerson 09/26/2022 17:10

Just confirming that Mystical Harps still crashes in two compiles as well

=== @ vlamart 09/26/2022 17:10

Mine ain't even make it past one üòù

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2022 21:37

(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl ""): This isn't crashing for me anymore when it was before, so I fixed *SOMETHING*...

=== @ Jigglysaint 09/28/2022 17:47

I had classic.zh crash when trying to add a new script
everything parses as normal, but after assigning slots and confirming, the game exits

=== @ vlamart 09/29/2022 12:13

Not sure if this is redundant info, but bug started Sept 9/10. At the time, Emily was working on making arrays more efficient and Connor was working on elaborating Undo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2022 08:11

I think I see exactly what's wrong
and I hate everything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2022 08:31

OK, seems that I found 2 separate issues
one related to scripts themselves
and one related to fucking GUI shit and the mouse cursor
I feel like I've fixed both probably?
The script one was absolutely my dumbass fault directly
the mouse one is code I think connor touched last, but, gui shit is fucking annoying

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2022 08:33

oh, nice
the mouse one appears to have also been the issue in #1885

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2022 09:07

@here #deleted-channel nightly in ~30 minutes, should fix this crash, needs testing

=== @ DergerSwerson 09/30/2022 09:50

bug fixed for me finally! Thanks for keeping at it

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/30/2022 10:10

\0~0/  Its fixed.*
Yaaaay

Weird, why was the mouse relevant?

=== @ vlamart 09/30/2022 15:48

It works! üéâ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/30/2022 23:36

(replying to @ Bagel Meister "Weird, why was the mouse rele‚Ä¶"): drawing to the screen
with a bad timing
causing a bitmap to become corrupted
causing a crash

=== @ Bagel Meister 09/30/2022 23:36

neat
