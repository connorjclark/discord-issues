It seems to reflect off the next mirror it crosses through after reflecting instead. Demonstrated on screen 1:11

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)  seeking some clarification since this mirror reflection code is rather lengthy and confusing even after the cleanup. Cause seems to be `ignorecombo` not being reset when hitting the mirror shield.
```    if(special>=1)                                            // hit Hero's shield
    {
        switch(id)
        {
            case ewRock:
            case ewMagic:
            case ewArrow:
            case ewSword:
                bounce=true;
                dead=16;
                return;
                
            case ewBrang:
                if(misc==0)
                {
                    clk2=256;
                    misc=1;
                    dir^=1;
                }
                return;
            case wRefMagic:
                ignoreHero=true;
                ignorecombo=-1;
                break;
        }
    }```
This section here seems to be unsetting it but only runs on a non reflecting shield collision. Was this just a typo where you set the variable in the wrong code block by mistake, or is there some reason a blocked weapon would interact with a mirror?

(replying to @ Moosh "https://github.com/ZQuestClas…"): oops
probably a typo

okay cool. Looks like a very simple fix
