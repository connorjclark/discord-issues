This would make lock blocks capable of changing and being dependant on ScreenD values. I can see a variety of possible uses here.

If I could give examples. You might use strings to initiate the thought of getting a key from a bucket which could later be used on a lock block on the screen. Or you could have gathering mini games of sorts.

Is this a viable idea? other combos have made use of Screen->D so I can see some use for it. Its by no means absolutely necessary, but would arm the user with "tricks up their sleeve"

The `Counter` value is an attribyte
meaning, it has a range of `0-255`, and literally can't hold a negative
