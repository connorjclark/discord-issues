So far:```
GENSCR_EVENT_INIT, //When loading in from a save/new quest
GENSCR_EVENT_CONTINUE, //When F6->Continue
GENSCR_EVENT_FFC_PRELOAD, //When FFCs run 'on screen init'
GENSCR_EVENT_CHANGE_SCREEN, //When the screen changes
GENSCR_EVENT_CHANGE_DMAP, //When the dmap changes
GENSCR_EVENT_CHANGE_LEVEL, //When the level changes
GENSCR_EVENT_HERO_HIT_1, //Player is hit, before ring applied
GENSCR_EVENT_HERO_HIT_2, //Player is hit, after ring applied
GENSCR_EVENT_COLLECT_ITEM, //Item is collected
```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/16/2022 21:16

Planned: Enemy hit 1 (before defense), hit 2 (after defense), enemy death (before item drop)

Changable things:
For Hero Hit, choose to nullify the hit, or change the Damage, HitDir, if nayru's is active for the hit, and invincibility frames (and read whatever enemy/lweapon/eweapon/combo hit them).
For Item Collect, choose to nullify the collection, or change the collected item ID, pickup flags, pickup string, and pickup string flags.
The Init, Continue, FFC Preload, change screen, change dmap, and change level events currently have no parameters, they are just there to trigger a script in those conditions.

...k, looking at enemies, they are gonna be more difficult than expected.
a lot of enemy code is split across multiple classes and bleh
but, thankfully, all enemies use the same one function to drop an item
```
GENSCR_EVENT_ENEMY_DROP_ITEM_1, //Enemy drops item (before item created)
GENSCR_EVENT_ENEMY_DROP_ITEM_2, //Enemy drops item (if & after item created)```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/16/2022 22:25

this occurs when the enemy is already dead to the point where it cannot be saved, and only will be called for enemies that drop an item (so ex. some segmented enemies may or may not based on QRs)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/16/2022 23:17

....and now you can interrupt enemy death.
That was easier than expected
```
GENSCR_EVENT_ENEMY_DEATH, //Enemy dying```
you just get a bool for if it's dying (which you can change to false), and the npc pointer to the enemy

TODO: Enemy hit (before/after defense)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/17/2022 11:00

```cpp
GENSCR_EVENT_ENEMY_HIT1, //Enemy hit, before defenses
GENSCR_EVENT_ENEMY_HIT2, //Enemy hit, after defenses
```

=== @ P-Tux7 08/17/2022 17:52

will shields be checked during HIT2 or are they their own event?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/17/2022 21:52

enemies check shields with defenses, it seems

=== @ vlamart 08/18/2022 00:04

How about `GENSCR_EVENT_TRIGGER_COMBO`? (I'm sure the option for both before and after a combo changes would make sense)

=== @ vlamart 08/18/2022 00:16

Or semantically, `_COMBO_CHANGE` to factor in things like push blocks since combo technically doesn't trigger, or does it technically not change? 🤔

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/20/2022 07:34

`_COMBO_CHANGE` is far too generic
happens far too often, too
would probably kill FPS to make that an event
(every time an event happens, it needs to loop through every generic script in the quest... and one block push would fire 2 of those events)
trigger, on the other hand, is probably more managable
