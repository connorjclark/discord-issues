Such as "Skip Combo Cycle on screen init" flag per individual combo, negative numbers for animations (going backwards in the tileset), and maybe even "Something->Previous" equivalents of "Something->Next" flags and types

I think Skip Combo Cycle on screen init should be a combo attribute, same for Secrets -> Next. Though of course the combo flag for Secrets -> Next can stay for specific use
We're trying to bake these into the combos for the REDUX and LTTP tilesets so that the user doesn't have to faff about with screen secret tiles for every single screen like they did in 2.50 and below.

I agree, it would be much easier to deal with most secrets this way

Maybe even moving or adding "generic->next" to an independent per combo "(trigger tab flags)->next" and "->pervious" flag or attribute?

so `->Next`/`->Prev` was done awhile ago
`Secrets->Next` can just be... an inherent flag.
because that's what those are for

Yes I saw that a few updates ago, thank you!
