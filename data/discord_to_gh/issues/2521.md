=== @ mitchfork 07/14/2023 17:55

We have various QR's for this but an arbitrary frame-based speed similar to the subscreen would be nice.  Something in Init Data > Vars?

fancy fancy fancy idea is had

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:15

> so, yeah, could default the setting to let the user set the scrolling speed to on for old quests with no global active script

How good of a signal would "no global script that _does not_ use a ScreenScrolling register" be
or something like that
allow configuration in old quests if:
1) no global scripts
2) some global script uses ScreenScrolling

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:17

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "allow configuration in old qu…"): ? When you say `uses ScreenScrolling` what are you thinking of?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:18

The Game->ScreenScrolling thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:18

that didn't exist yet
the issue is any script that uses any drawing command, which can happen to be during scrolling time

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:18

But even when it does exist, wont there be quests that still dont use it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:18

or... any script with logic that relies on the duration of scrolling

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:18

and do funky manual timing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:18

the problem is you could break a quest that relies on timing during scrolling
which is ANY global active slot, for pre-2.55 quests

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:19

I thought the issue was scripts doing _important_ work during scrolling. Just....drawing is not important.
But doing something big like "on the last/first/nth frame, set player health to _whatever"
or "spawn something..."

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:19

could be doing any of those things
and there's no good way to detect it
drawing is likely the most common issue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:20

I might be only thinking about the fast/normal speed distinction
I see how the no-speed variant would be problematic...since nothing runs at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:20

no scrolling runs a single frame
but yeah, much less time

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:21

Wait, so now I'm back to: if a script is using ScreenScrolling, can't we just assume it is not doing manual timing that would break if we change a scroll from taking N frames -> N/2 frames -> one frame (or whatever)?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:21

If a script is using `Game->Scrolling[]`, yes (PROBABLY), though that would be only in 2.55 quests
....though knowing some of these scripters they'd have some script re-used from a previous quest that still relies on it manually even while a new script might use the new stuff
....or that they decided to use `Game->Scrolling[]` and check a manual X/Y position to detect the end of the scroll, which could break with a modifiable scroll speed
so, really, no
old quests (pre-2.55) that have an empty global active slot should be safe to allow custom scroll speed on, anything else it would not.
(which will just be toggling a single flag when I add this settings system, that might take a bit because moving my arms really hurts right now due to sunburnnn)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:24

player configuration options:

- Auto - defer to player configuration ONLY in cases we 100% know are ok - either by analyzing old qst or looking at the new QR we add (Default)
- Auto 2 - ...also in cases we are only kinda sure about....
- Always use quest definition for scrolling
(could argue about what the default should be)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:25

ehh, don't see the need. `Auto` sounds perfect.
The way I intend on setting this, the user setting would be per-save-file, for the record- and would default to the quest's initial definition for each new save.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:27

It depends on just how many quests exist out there that use ScreenScrolling somewhere, but still rely on manual timing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:27

That's also just 2.55 recent quests that do something with scrolling somewhere
which is probably an extreme minority
I mostly just feel like it's not a worthwhile case to worry about

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:28

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "The way I intend on setting t…"): I don't see player _preferences_ changing on a save-by-save (or per qst) basis, so this is potentially a little cumbersome. But I understand some quests if it broke you'd want to rememeber unsetting your player override...
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "which is probably an extreme…"): fair enough

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:29

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I don't see player _preferenc…"): It definitely can depend on quests. When playtesting my MM2D, I really loved the `No Scrolling`, as it let you move through the larger environment quicker- for most other quests I prefer `Fast Scrolling`.
Making it per-save is out of convenience for how to save the data.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:30

the answer here, of course, is an extra level of "default defaults" for what to set the default to by default ...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:31

So, the speed will probably be a number of pixels per frame they can set? Might want to consider allowing decimal (though the values used for the viewport would likely need to be rounded at each loop, but that's simple enough).
I'd say setting 0px/frame would act as `No Scrolling`, instantly finishing, while any positive value would be the scroll speed.
This would be added to `Init Data`, replacing the existing QRs (allowing removing them from the GUI), so questmakers can set an arbitrary default speed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:32

I'd prefer just giving some well-defined presets. under the hood and in the cfg file it would set a number but
the UI we should is just a radio select

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:33

well, the way I want to do these settings I want to allow scripts to create custom settings
so it'll want to have textfields for all sorts of numbers, dropdowns, checkboxes, etc all available
I don't see why letting the user type in a speed of their choice would be a problem

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:33

sure but it'd also want a "choose one of these options" input
(dropdown)
(oh you said that)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:34

mm, so just a set of presets as well?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:34

anyhow direction sounds great to me, this will be neat 👍

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:34

yeah
designing the actual dialog system for this is gonna be the rough part
and then hooking it into script access will be the other rough part
...the option for scrolling itself is a much smaller thing in comparison lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:36

basically I need a way for scripts to add entries to a vector to build up Dialog elements, which then need to be read from to generate an actual dialog using the new dialog system- and have an appropriate way to set that data back. Anything we want to do for an engine option (like a dropdown or something for presets), we also want to offer for script options.
And, then based on QRs or the like, add some hardcoded elements (like the scrolling setting) to the top of the dialog

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:37

inb4 @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) says "lets make the entire GUI system accessible from zscript"
imagine making macros that emulate what our macros are doing
_shudders_

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:37

I mean that's almost what I'm allowing here, emulating the whole gui system
but it'll only be very few options
no tabs/scrollpanes/etc or any positional shit, all the options will just be auto-positioned
but, the idea is to allow something like
`Settings->AddCheckbox("Right-Facing Slash",true);`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:40

`Settings->AddTextfield("Menu Speed",0,255,true,"Instant",0,"Slow",8,"Fast",16);`
(here the premise being `Label,minval,maxval,bool allow_decimals, variadic args list for default presets to allow`)
...just a mockup, no idea if that's actually the way I'd want to do that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:42

if AddTextField and AddNumberField as separate functions, the list of args is saner
pure text does not need min/max range

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:42

err, yeah, lol, I was just thinking of number fields for that one

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:42

and the boolean drops

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:42

(...I forget textfields are used for text pretty often lol, they are used for numbers far far far more often)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:43

and this is minor but I think Setting->AddBoolean and Settings->AddText etc... (ignoring the impl. details of _how_ we make the ui) sounds better to me
Settings->AddNumber
etc

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:43

fair

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:45

just gonna pseudocode some

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:47

```cpp
int Settings->AddBoolean(char32[] name, char32[] info, bool defVal);
 * Adds a boolean option (Checkbox) to the settings dialog, with the specified `name` as a label, and a help text button displaying `info`.
 * Returns the index the setting was added at.

int Settings->AddText(char32[] name, char32[] info, char32[] default_txt, int maxChars);
 * Adds a text option to the settings dialog, to the settings dialog, with the specified `name` as a label, and a help text button displaying `info`.
* Does not allow more than `maxChars` characters. If `maxChars <= 0`, it will be treated as 'max limit'. The max limit is `1024 characters`, for sanity reasons.
 * Returns the index the setting was added at.```

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:48

(Name, description) should be first two args for everything

Where description creates a help button

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:48

ah, aye, help buttons

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:48

And name is also used as an identifer to query the value in script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:51

(edited above)
ah, I was using it returning an index
instead of querying value by name, which requires string comparisons
...could also have the user SPECIFY an index, or rather a key?
and store it as a `map`
I think I like that better

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:55

```cpp
void Settings->AddBoolean(int key, char32[] name, char32[] info, bool defVal);
 * Adds a boolean option (Checkbox) to the settings dialog, with the specified `name` as a label, and a help text button displaying `info`.
 * Replaces any existing setting using the specified 'key'.

void Settings->AddText(int key, char32[] name, char32[] info, char32[] default_txt, int maxChars);
 * Adds a text option to the settings dialog, to the settings dialog, with the specified `name` as a label, and a help text button displaying `info`.
* Does not allow more than `maxChars` characters. If `maxChars <= 0`, it will be treated as 'max limit'. The max limit is `1024 characters`, for sanity reasons.
 * Replaces any existing setting using the specified 'key'.```

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 18:56

Providing a key will make separate scripts from different authors clash
So...maybe returning a index is cool?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 18:56

mmm, I suppose. Though being able to just specify a constant key seems useful too, especially when developing a single quest.
Could say that only keys `>= 0` are valid, and any key `< 0` will instead automatically find the first free key, and return it?
(and make it an optional param at the end defaulting to -1, probably then?)

....meh, but you can also in developing your own quest ensure that the values are always in the same order if you really care to...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 19:03

Looks good

So how would a FFC script access a setting made in the global script?
Global script stores the key in a global thing?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:04

Either that, or if you're developing your own quest with it you can just ensure they are always in a hardcoded order and use constants
(i.e. all settings are made in one function in order, so you can just declare an enum in that same order and have it always be correct)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 19:04

@ Moosh  @ Russ any thoughts on this plan

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:06

 * Adds a number option to the settings dialog. The number must be between 'minval' and 'maxval', inclusively- if the user sets a value out of range, the result will be clamped.
 * Decimal place values are only allowed if `allow_decimal` is passed as true.
 * Returns the index of this setting.```
and then maybe like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:07

`setting Settings->LoadSetting(int index);`
to return a `setting` typed pointer with its' own members
like `type` which would be a constant representing one of these widget types
and an `int getValue()`, `void getString(char32[] buf)` (`int getValue()` would return 0/1 for boolean types)

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:14

So the way my old header worked was it read Link->Action and Link's position and then timed the scroll manually. I'm fairly confident only Russ and I actually used it in a quest and only for visual effects though

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:15

Probably wouldn't be easy to detect though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:20

```cpp

```
So, you can create the settings
load them and individually edit them
and if you want them to have a dropdown of presets, you can add individual preset options to each setting.
(replying to @ Moosh "So the way my old header work…"): thoughts on *this stuff*, not just the scrolling stuff?
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
Setting types of `Boolean` (checkbox), `Number` (numeric field), `Text` (plain text field) all seem easy enough
....I could add a boolean flag to the settings to let you turn any of those INTO dropdowns
```cpp
bool setting->OnlyPresets;
 * If set to true, only the presets will be selectable, the actual setting will not appear anymore.```
so, imagine a `Number` (numeric textfield).... except since this is `true`, it *doesn't have a textfield for you to type in*, it *just* has the dropdown that would normally be next to it with presets in it.
so you can only pick the preset numbers
Is there anything else we might want?

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:29

Oh! Hadn't scrolled down enough

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:30

Checkboxes ✅
Text ✅
Numbers ✅
Dropdowns ✅
Radio selectors? Dropdowns kinda cover this.
....Special selectors like *tile selectors*? Not really doable on the ZC side I don't think for technical reasons.

=== @ Russ 07/14/2023 19:30

(replying to @ Moosh "So the way my old header work…"): Aevin too, IIRC, but yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:30

but fully script-customizable `Checkboxes`,`Textfields`,`Numberfields`, and `Dropdowns` seems pretty nice to me

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:31

Has Aevin made a solo game since Hero's Memory?

=== @ Russ 07/14/2023 19:31

I’ll have to read over everything a bit later. Got a wake today and a funeral tomorrow
Technically Hitodama was a solo project before the update

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:33

On one hand this seems like a really cool idea that would be healthy for the program. On the other hand, relative to the size of the community I don't see it getting much use, at least not any time soon. There's a sweet spot needed where scripters would want to add settings to their quest but not have the know-how to make their own UI for selecting them. And that's kinda niche.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:35

It also makes a request for a settings script dead-easy to achieve in a few lines
and... if it's engine managable, who's to say we can't add a way for ZQ to set up initial settings eventually too?

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:36

There's also the matter of like...if I were to add a setting to a database script. It needs to have an index, which it wouldn't be hard to get by just finding the last active setting. But then it would also need a way to store that index which introduces a global variable problem if said script isn't a generic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:36

...you'd need to read the settings to do things somehow, of course

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:36

And the script would then conflict with any other script using fixed settings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:36

that being the key problem
(replying to @ Moosh "There's also the matter of li…"): find it by name then, adding a by-name search should be simple enough

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:37

Personally, while settings being accessed by indices is faster I think it'd be better if they were accessed by strings
so yeah we're on the same page there
Have an addsetting function with an internal name and a label name. Then have all the other functions get it by the internal name

=== @ Russ 07/14/2023 19:38

Something occurs to me about the screen scrolls

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:38

Maybe have a function to get an ID from the internal name

=== @ Russ 07/14/2023 19:38

We can’t assume a quest without a global script doesn’t use stuff
A script with run ffc at screen init could also break
I know I have some with that checked that manually account for the screen scrolls time

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:39

(replying to @ Russ "A script with run ffc at scre…"): I assume variable scroll times wouldn't affect screen init
Because it only runs for a single frame at the start

=== @ Russ 07/14/2023 19:39

But if the script is timed to wait until after scrolling is done…

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:40

And that'd still function the same

=== @ Russ 07/14/2023 19:40

Would it?

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:40

Or never functioned to begin with
Because sceen init happens, script runs for one frame, scroll ends, script is waiting for the screen to finish scrolling (which it already has)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:40

(replying to @ Moosh "Have an addsetting function w…"): bleh, needing 2 names is extra pain though

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:40

We made some bad assumptions about how screen init worked in the past

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:40

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "bleh, needing 2 names is extr…"): easier to just require names be unique entirely

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:41

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "easier to just require names…"): Okay admittedly the two names is only necessary if we also have _headings_

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:41

(replying to @ Russ "I know I have some with that…"): how could that possibly affect that? don't think it should be able to

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:41

So settings could be organized by which script they're associated with

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:41

yeah, headings were not planned

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:41

Then it might be possible two scripts have a setting with the same label name

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:42

it would just be in sequential order you added the settings in, plainly
...feel like a searchbar style like QRs use might be a bit painful/laggy for this use case, so probably not even that
so, yeah, you'd just use a specific label, possibly with your script name in it directly
(Trying to create a setting with a conflicting name would generate an error and fail to create the setting)
...now, as for engine settings, how would those work? I feel like giving them negative indexes sounds sane enough, and those can have constants.

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:45

```(Trying to create a setting with a conflicting name would generate an error and fail to create the setting)```
I don't know if it should create an error actually. Because it'd be handy to be able to create a setting at the start of a script and not have to check if the setting was already created

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:45

(so like, `SETTING_SCROLLSPEED = -1`

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:45

Just having a -1 return value instead of its ID would make sense to me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:45

(replying to @ Moosh "Just having a -1 return value…"): you shouldn't be trying to re-make settings like that, tbh
it'll be not a simple function for this

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:46

Okay wack idea. Could every instance of the addsetting function be auto appended to ~Init?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:46

Not really

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:46

darn

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:46

...should be easy enough to just use `GetName` to see if it exists first if you plan on creating them in a spot that might run multiple times)
err
`FindSetting`
even
```cpp
setting Settings->LoadSetting(int index);
 * Loads the setting with the specified index.
 * Returns NULL if no such setting currently exists.

setting Settings->FindSetting(char32[] name);
 * Loads the setting with the specified string name.
 * Returns NULL if no such setting currently exists.```

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:47

What happens if you run addsetting on an FFC script?
Or some other script that doesn't run on quest load

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:47

🤷‍♀️ why would anything special happen because it's an ffc script?
it would add the setting
nothing about these requires being on quest load

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:48

That'd be awkward though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:48

you could have settings related to an item not appear until you get that item
for instance

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:48

If I had a setting associated with an FFC script I wouldn't want to have to create a global script just to add it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:48

well how else would you do it

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:48

What about script metadata?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:49

not relevant

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:49

ZC can't read that?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:49

not a chance that can hold all the info related to settings

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:49

double darn

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:49

zasm metadata is a tiny addon to scripts
it holds tiny bits of metadata
not entire giant chunks of settings

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:50

Most setting metadata wouldn't be longer than a help string, but I can see dropdowns being messy yeah...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:51

yeah, it'd be a lot of data lol
....honestly your problem sounds like one that would be solved by allowing multiple user-side `global script Init`s

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:52

technically I guess ~Init already exists. I'm making a whole issue over nothing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:52

you would have to have the user merge that though if you have more than one, right? (don't think I ever changed that)

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:52

Every script with settings could have its own init script and it'd just work
I don't think so?
Any script with init as its name should be appended to init. Though I've rarely ever used it so maybe it's broken lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:54

(replying to @ Moosh "Any script with init as its n…"): yes, but you can't have multiple scripts with the *same name*
so there can only be one user script appended to `~Init`, the single global script named `Init`.

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:54

oh fuck offfffff ZQuest why are you so awful
yeah okay so that's completely useless 🤢
why did they even make it work like this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:55

....I should just add an annotation for this, `@InitScript(true)`
any global script with the annotation setting that true gets appended, in whatever order?
does that make sense?

=== @ Moosh 07/14/2023 19:55

Yeah that makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 19:56

that's a separate issue, gonna split that to its' own thread
(meta) thread name was changed: Settings Dialog / arbitrary screen scroll speed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 20:47

Last wrench I'll throw into this:

Everything discussed so far has been about a Setting menu, presumably something that is accessed via the System menu at any time when the player pauses.

But what about other places where a quest might want to get user input in a simple, structured way?

A way to create these "forms" to present to the user. One purpose (what we've been discussing) is to create a sav-file-specific settings menu. Another, a script could create a form and present it to the user at will, getting back some structured input from the player.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 20:48

The API is nearly there to support this. But instead of Setting->whatever, we would need a new object type (Form?) then we could do `Settings->ApplyForm(form)`, or `SettingsForm->AddBoolean`, or whatever
(then just add `Form->Show`)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 20:50

I know Moosh has done some really fancy stuff (7th quest), and that's way better than what this UI could be, but this would be simpler for those that can't be bothered.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 20:57

So, yeah, just generalizing it to multiple such forms, and having the ability to set one to access via the UI, that makes sense
kinda already works with how I was sketching this out
instead of `Settings->` it would be `form->`, and we'd have `Game->CreateForm()` similar to `Game->CreateRNG()`, just returning a new form
`form->Own()`/`form->Free()`,etc for managing the forms
I would allow `form->Globalize()`, to mark the form to be saved to the save file? (similar to how `GlobalObject()` works for class/object stuff)
and then `Game->SetSettingsForm(form f);` to set a form as the settings menu
Engine settings like the scrolling setting, would need to function differently- you would not access those as they would not be part of the form, they would just appear above the form in the settings menu (probably will even differentiate it in the UI)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 21:00

Love it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:01

...I would probably for the scrolling setting have writing it just directly update the `Game->Generic[]` index that would be reserved for handling the scrolling setting being init-data settable anyway.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 21:01

Yeah scripting just won't know about those builtin things we decide to add to the settings form (via the Form directly, I mean)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:01

so, it would just update the setting as Init Data would
and changes to the `Game->Generic[]` then would take priority over the user setting
(i.e. overwriting it)
this sounds pretty sane

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:09

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I would allow `form->Globaliz…"): ...actually, not gonna bother with globalizing them to save them, that's a bunch of work.
The *settings form* will be saved, as a hardcoded engine form, however you set it.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 21:19

> `Game->SetSettingsForm(form f)`

This is again problematic when you consider multiple scripts from different authors. `Game->SettingForm` can just exist as a global?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:20

mm, except that makes it slightly harder to handle adding the hardcoded entries to the list
I was planning on `Game->SetSettingsForm(form f);` which copies `f` to the settings form, and `Game->GetSettingsForm(form f);` which copies FROM the settings form TO `f`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 21:20

Don't add it to the actual form stucture?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:20

I mean, I suppose

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 21:20

But when we show the "settings form", internally we know it is the settings form
and at _that point_ add the builtin stuff

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:21

...yeah, that's just smart.
ok, so I can just have `form SettingsForm;` as a global of its' own
(similar to how there are `randgen` pointers, and the global `randgen RandGen;` of its' own for the engine RNG)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:27

....mm, only one problem though
now there are multiple `form`s each with their own `setting`s
that's gonna be an issue methinks, as far as pointer management goes
....the question is how many max forms do we want, and how many max settings per form, keeping in mind that the product of those numbers must fit in the 32-bit signed limit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:30

or, do I want to have you load/own/etc settings as well, and have them just copy to/from forms as a separate set of objects?
...that would make putting a single thing on multiple forms easy, but it makes just editing a single form clunkier
probably not...
(..can always just add copying functions to let people copy things as well)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 21:31

Are you calling the fields in a form a "setting"?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:31

yeah, that's how I had it
fields is probably better now that we're going with forms
hadn't taken the time to rename my notes yet though
...let me share what I have right now

the `.txt` is pure notes, mostly in the form of `ZScript_Additions.txt` documentation, and some `std_constants.zh` stuff
the `.cpp`/`.h` are actual structure and startings of some code (not compiled/cmaked/anything yet, just outlining the ideas in my head)
but yeah renaming `setting->` to `field->` seems simple enough

renamed that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:39

I could presumably add a `field->AddTo(form f);` and `field->CopyTo(field other);` (similar to the `form->AddTo(form other);`/`form->CopyTo(form other);`)
and a `field->CopyPresetsTo(field other);` to copy just a presets dropdown

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/14/2023 21:52

```cpp
bool field->AddTo(form f);
 * Adds a copy of this field to the specified form.
 * Returns false if the form `f` already contains a field of the same name as this field.
 * Otherwise, returns true, and the form `f` now contains a copy of this field.

void field->CopyTo(field other);
 * Copies this field over the `other` field, replacing its contents entirely.

void field->CopyPresetsTo(field other);
 * Copies this field's presets over the `other` field's presets, replacing them.

bool field->AddPresetsTo(field other);
 * Copies this field's presets to the `other` field's presets, adding them.
 * Returns false and makes no changes if any presets have duplicate names between the fields,
 *     except if the presets have the same name AND value, in which case the duplicate is ignored.
 * Otherwise, returns true, and the `other` field contains both its previous presets and the presets of this field.```
