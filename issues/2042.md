Pretty much what is says in the title.  If a side warp is set up on a 16x8 map edge, you cannot activate it while Walk Through Walls is enabled - you'll just run into it as if it's solid.

not a new bug; this is like 2.50 old, can confirm

This is true _wherever_ there's a warp, be it sidewarp or tile warp. Location doesn't matter. I would in fact argue that this isn't a bug since the purpose of walk through walls is to ignore things that would normally affect the player

walkthrough walls doesn't ignore side warps normally
it just ignores them on the map edge, which is annoying

(replying to @ ywkls "This is true _wherever_ there…"): Yeah, it allows side warps most of the time

I guess that I didn't know that
