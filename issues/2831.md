With the ability to click and drag to select on the combo pane, would it be possible to have large brushes also draw on adjacent screens. Moosh's auto combo stuff alters adjacent screens so it seems pretty possible.

This would definitely make some things easier for _some_ occasions, though thanks to our now being able to drag the mouse over the combo page to select our own brushes, we can just do it within an extra second on the adjacent screen.

Moosh's Autocombo thing stretching into the next screen instead of stopping at the edge of the screen could either be as simple as holding some additional hotkey like shift or something, or too technical to actually do.
