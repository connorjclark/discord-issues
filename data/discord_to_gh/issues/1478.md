Just some buttons that let you cycle to the previous or next FFC in the list while editing. Would speed up the process of setting up scripts a lot when you need to change multiple arguments.

Yep.  Agreed.

Heck, somehow, I think a text box to accept a number and a "go" button next to it would be LESS productive because who memorizes what data is in what FFC slot?  So those next/prev buttons would indeed be far more valuable.  Probably the most valuable thing.

Mostly it's annoying having to click okay, click the dropdown list, click on the next or previous number, then click edit

Can I request that these buttons also be on the script tab. Because the dropdown being moved to that tab mildly inconveniences me sometimes when looking for an FFC carrying a script

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/22/2022 19:36

I can have them be on all tabs

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) you can reference what itemeditor.cpp does for `_reset_default`
