(Nightly 2023-08-20 to 2023-08-28-2)
okay so there's a bit to unpack here
1. Item overrides only allow the highest level of that itemclass show on the subscreen (if it even is on the subscreen, if not nothing shows up), whether there is a single item override or multiple overrides from the same item class
2. when i playtest the quest it sometimes crashes by loading and sometimes it doesn't, it's pretty inconsistent
i've even tried this on a blank quest to the same effect

ok yeah there were some issues with overrides and stuff, I appear to have fixed this?
also I caught several sections that were reading out of bounds in an array, which could have caused random crashing
so this may be fixed now

=== @ Attempt 08/29/2023 10:31

ahh, well we shall see in the next nightly. many thanks <a:Kitty_Vibe:915145632702930975>

=== @ Attempt 08/29/2023 11:19

sure

=== @ Attempt 08/29/2023 11:27

still seems to happen. both the crashing and only the highest level item override is showing up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/29/2023 11:28

Can you provide a test quest

=== @ Attempt 08/29/2023 11:29

yep

this is off on your white sword there
which means by having the white sword, you *no longer have the wood sword*

=== @ Attempt 08/29/2023 11:32

OOOOOO
i'm used to the old flag where the flag on removes lower level items

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/29/2023 11:32

the keep lower level items flag used to just ***not work***
and it used to act like it was always checked
but that was fixed

=== @ Attempt 08/29/2023 11:33

gotcha
still don't know what causes the crash

=== @ Attempt 08/29/2023 11:35

AHHH i see
it crashes while the keep lower level items is off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/29/2023 11:36

I've crashed a couple times now, trying to get to the bottom of it

=== @ Attempt 08/29/2023 11:36

üëç

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/29/2023 11:48

=== @ Attempt 08/29/2023 11:50
