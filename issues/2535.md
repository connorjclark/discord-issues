@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) is this a ZC bug, or a quest bug, or a user issue?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/19/2023 02:54

I cannot reproduce on my end
something weird I'm noticing is that the item that's supposed to be drawn in the L button spot can be partially seen onscreen
(that green/white thing above the L)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/19/2023 02:57

if that item wasn't offset, I'd assume something was wrong with the larger item sprites used in the subscreen

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/19/2023 02:58

They claimed it only happened in 32 bit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/19/2023 03:18

...okay, reproduced it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/19/2023 03:31

Just 32b? Interesting.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 22:47

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) did you look into this?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/30/2023 00:57

I have not yet

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/30/2023 01:05

Exhibit A for why we should simply drop win 32 bit support
_gestures at this bug_
wait no I take this back lmao web version is limited to 32 bit until WASM is improved so suddenly I care now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/30/2023 01:12

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "...okay, reproduced it"): What can I do to repro?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/30/2023 01:34

cant figure out how to cheat my way into having anything in L slot

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/30/2023 01:48

the quest starts you off with an item in the L slot
and the sword

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/30/2023 01:48

oh, i was just doing -test randomness
thx

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/30/2023 01:48

lemme find a screen that skips the opening cutscene
dmap 40 screen 0
press start to choose a character

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/30/2023 03:15

Not seeing any issues in 32bit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/30/2023 03:26

you can see a sword in your inventory?
oh, I repro'd it on alpha 114
so no clue whether it got fixed or if the bug just hid itself

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/30/2023 03:28

ah, I'm on latest.
locally built

Closing this
