A QR that makes attempting to use active items whose cost requirements are not met play a buzzer sound. This means BUTTON items only, so it would play when attempting to use a Wand without enough magic, but if there is enough magic to use the Wand itself but NOT enough magic to satisfy the cost for the Magic Book to spawn its fire, it will NOT play a buzzer sound in that scenario. This rejection sound is also settable in Misc. Data.

(LTTP had the string for when you wrte out of magic and attempted to use magic-using items, but I don't think ANYONE wants that aspect)
