So, another QR that adds on to New Hero Movement, that toggles a lot of new code related to movement multipliers.
Known Additions so Far:
Ability to set speed multipliers on combos (instead of just having Slow Walk Combos)
Ability to set speed multipliers of Swimming (both fast and Normal), Slow Walk from Charging Sword

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:19

^ Replacing the "fast/slow" swim option, since that's just a setting anyway

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/01/2023 17:20

For at least combos, and perhaps Swimming, support for both reduced and increased movement speed.
Possibility of Flippers having a new parameter that updates Swim Speeds

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:21

Active Shields similarly already have a feature for modifying walking speed

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/01/2023 17:22

I don't think we need an item that "disabled slow walk combos", someone can script that. Uh... that does mean scripts need to be able to access this new "StepMult" value, though if it's just an existing unused parameter there wouldn't be an issue?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 17:23

err?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/01/2023 17:23

~~alternatively one can just swap out Slow Walk combos with identical looking normal combos with a script~~
Was thinking of the Swamp Water in Minish Cap and how it doesn't affect you while dashing with Pegasus Boots.
So there could be scenarios where one wants to "toggle" slow walk, though there are scripting solutions so code for that should not be necessary?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 18:39

So, for swimming, I can make the multiplier be just part of the normal `New Hero Movement` QR, porting it to 2/3 or 1/2 based on the swim speed setting in the quest.

For combos having speed values... I can probably also make that work with just `New Hero Movement`. It would stack oddly with existing slow combos, but, I could just make it not stack with them... hmm.

Then there's being slow while charging, which appears to be on the *sword*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 18:43

...hmm, yeah, this might not need a new QR? I might be able to just use new options on stuff.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 22:17

duplicate locked: #2355

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 22:18

....I feel like it's better to not allow negative multipliers, because that makes the math REALLY confusing.

=== @ P-Tux7 05/01/2023 22:19

yeah it'd be only trolly
not to mention take more storage
(or divisors)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 22:20

I think a byte multiplier and byte divisor (so 0-255) works nicely

=== @ P-Tux7 05/01/2023 22:20

yep!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 22:20

the fractional approach avoids the need for decimals, there
...then, I could probably give a full zfix (int with 4 decimal places) for the additive value
which, can be negative to subtract

=== @ P-Tux7 05/01/2023 22:21

would an int adder (positive to add, negative to subtract) or two bytes (adders and subtractors) take more room?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 22:22

int is better, but, an adder here needs decimal places

=== @ P-Tux7 05/01/2023 22:22

true, fair
i was going to say "maybe 0-255 should cover the whole spectrum of speed" but it might not be granular enough to look smooth when dealing with acceleration (i.e. ice)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 23:35

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Was thinking of the Swamp Wat…"): To add engine pegasus boots, which ARE on the list at some point, I would probably add combo triggers `Bonk->` (bonked into with dash), `Dash Over->` (dashing while stepping on the combo), and `Dashing->` (dashing, *anywhere on the screen*)- as well as `Not Dashing->` (Opposite of `Dashing->`). You could, in such situation, have `Dashing->Combo Change(+1)` change it to a non-slowing combo, and `Not Dashing->Combo Change(-1)` revert it when you stop.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/01/2023 23:39

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Ability to set speed multipli…"): ....SOOO, swimming

1/2 for slow swim, 2/3 for fast swim, loaded on quest load. Only applies with `New Hero Movement` on, changing the fast/slow swim now only applies with `New Hero Movement` OFF.
And, yes, you can change it via cheat L3 during play.
Also yes, I added `?` buttons to the `Vars` tab, to ever single entry.
I also have the combo stuff done in theory, but no gui access to it to test it
and I still need to add script access for everything new

=== @ P-Tux7 05/01/2023 23:51

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "To add engine pegasus boots,…"): yeah, i was actually thinking that cliff jumping, bonking, and the #2278 stuff could reuse the same or similar code for such "forced jumps"
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Also yes, I added `?` buttons…"): low key best addition

also @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) should be in this thread
so should @ Moosh

So, here's currently where movement is at (with `New Hero Movement` on):
```md
1. The move distance is determined by the player's step speed (`Hero->Step`)
2. If the player is using an 'Active' shield, and that active shield is set to modify the movement speed, that modifier is applied (percentage multiplier, where `-100%` has the same effect as `200%`, `100%` has no effect (stays the same speed).
3. If the combo at `Hero->X+7,Hero->Y+8` on any layer has player speed modifiers set in the new `General` tab, those are applied. Layer 6 applies first, and it works its way down, stopping early if it reaches a `Bridge` combo (blocking the speed modifiers below it). Each modifier applies the Multiplier, then Divisor, then Additive, in that order.
4. Multiply and divide by a special multiplier/divisor. This is determined by this check:
  1. If swimming, use the multiplier/divisor from Init Data. (This is `*2/3` for fast swim, `*1/2` for slow swim)
  2. Else, if EITHER charging a sword with slow charge OR the combo at `Hero->X+7,Hero->Y+8` on layer 0 is a Slow type combo (NOT BOTH), uses `*2/3`.
  3. Else, if BOTH a slow charge sword AND a slow type combo, `*1/2`.
  4. Else `*1/1`, no change.
5. If the player is moving diagonally, the movement rate is multiplied by `0.7071`, or `1/sqrt(2)`- this means you move the same 'true distance' diagonally as you would orthogonally, instead of moving 'faster' at diagonals.```

...ahk, so, there is a bit of a mess here compat-wise with how some stuff works. And I've also just finally *understood* the true mess that is the player movement. So it seems time for a second QR for these new changes... with a bit more rewriting to do.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2023 05:05

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> I'm gonna need your help with this, like, maybe tomorrow if you're free? @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/02/2023 05:06

Possibly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2023 05:06

my brain is fried tonight, and there's some side swimming stuff involved so your help would be useful
because, like, the ENTIRE way link's collision works is complete bullshit
(I'm rewriting `::movehero()`, leaving behind `::moveheroOld()`)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2023 05:11

qr: `Newer Player Movement` (vs `New Player Movment`) is being added for this change set
