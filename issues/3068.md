(this is fixable just by editing the default.qst, just like tiles, for the record, if you wanted to fix it)

I can, but I figured with the snafu where I almost deleted the custom weapons, I figured I'd let you rearrange it the way you preferred
We can do it without rearranging the current item setup if we delete one of the two custom weapons

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "We can do it without rearrang‚Ä¶"): üëç thats fine
those were mostly there as placeholders for fire/ice rod eventually
but we can rework it later when we actually need those lol
