A versatile catchall push block as a combo type

Thoughts on what could be included:

-ComboType Effect - Pushes the block in a direction. ONLY usable when hit with a directional L/Eweapon - one that is moving exactly up/down/left/right. Unsure how to handle other weapons and directions - should they still allow triggering it (for combo change, sounds, drops, etc.) but just not push it, or be completely incapable of triggering it

Flags
-Push Force Equal to Item Power - The Power of the needed item in the itemclass that is needed to push, is multiplied by the combo's base push speed. For example, a 2-Power Bracelet pushes a combo that is pushed one block by default, two blocks. Unsure if it should apply to Req. Item items
-Push Amount Equal to Item Power - The Power of the needed item in the itemclass that is needed to push, is equal to how many pushes you can push the combo. For example, simulate a Worn-Out Bracelet by setting the Bracelet Power to 1, or if you set it to 3, you can push the combo three times per screen. Unsure if it should apply to Req. Item items

No,no,no, things don't push multiple blocks
unless they are icy

oh i know
i meant the span of two blocks, sorry

=== @ P-Tux7 04/10/2023 03:26

so *one* block is pushed *twice* as far and quickly if pushed with a bracelet with a power of 2

=== @ P-Tux7 04/10/2023 03:28

oh yeah! do icy pushblocks have the ability to stop at a block destination if they cross it
i feel as though that'd be nice for Block Hole-flagged combos so that you can push ice-type pushblocks in them to create a walkable path

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i meant the span of two block…"): I am aware, my point stands
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "oh yeah! do icy pushblocks ha…"): and, that would make too much sense. They probably should, but I hadn't considered that, so they definitely don't

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/10/2023 04:12

...OK, so now they will check each block they move to see if they fall into any Block Holes or Pitfalls. They will NOT check Triggers along the way, you need to be precise on those.

Another idea for improving bracelet - Stack Pushable blocks.

nope.

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Thoughts on what could be inc…"): So:
-Denied (obscure, difficult, sounds janky to implement)
-Denied (Not dealing with pushing multiple distance)
-Denied (Seems a bit obscure. Also, if it's just the power REQUIRED for it, then this can be done in about 2 seconds as it is by copying a number from one field to another...)
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "oh yeah! do icy pushblocks ha…"): added, per:
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...OK, so now they will check…"): ^
(replying to @ Alucard648 "Another idea for improving br…"): and Denied (seems like an absolute nightmare)

=== @ P-Tux7 04/10/2023 05:00

oh, are ice pushblocks the only ones that can move more than one combo's width when pushed?
sorry, i misinterpreted what i read on the purezc discord

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/10/2023 05:09

yeah, only ice blocks slide multiple combos
and nothing about that is telling them how far to slide, it just tells them *not to stop sliding* until it hits something

=== @ Alucard648 04/10/2023 10:02

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and Denied (seems like an abs…"): I did stackpushing using recursive checking for pushability. Feel free to reverse engineer my script/s. Maybe even rewrite block pushing helps here.
