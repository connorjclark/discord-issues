With Alpha 106/107 Build 61 on a fresh launch attempting to create a new safe file and launch the first quest, it gives a "file not found" error

....doesn't happen to me
enter name, hit OK without selecting anything, it works

OH
It only happens if you hit browse then cancel
first
...pfft, I see what I fixed wrong last time
should be fixed
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíLoading First Quest cannot find the quest file
The problem here is mostly because of one thing
Normally, the custom quest dialog doesn't do 1st.qst for you
it would have a blank box, and to do 1st you'd just cancel
I wanted to have it autofill the quest there
...but if I just filled it normally, then hitting "browse" would start in the modules folder instead of in the main zc folder. So I had to do a bit of *magic*, which I clearly didn't quite have right
