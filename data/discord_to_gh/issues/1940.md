basicly a in the system way to make lttp/links awakening ledges

uhh
placed tiles don't have 'z level'
unless you mean like, layers

Zelda Classic is entirely 2-Dimensional, and differences in height are just simulated (I'm pretty sure)

There is a script for ledges, like in ALttP and LA, however.

basicly, im asking for a way to make a 3d zelda classic using a feature in the editor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/03/2022 12:58

so, uh
that's *way* too broad and generic a request

I guess an idea I have would be like a trampoline combo type? That when solid, you jump over it in the direction when pushed against it. And that when walkable, you jump when stepped on it (flag specifies sensitive or not)

@ Majora remember when we were brainstorming this ^

Yup üòÇ

for instance, if we had a tool to set how high something was enermys in this pit could not be hurt unless you go down into pit

Height is out of the question
There can be no 3rd axis

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/04/2022 09:13

(replying to @ jessespy "for instance, if we had a too‚Ä¶"): that's called making the walls solid and giving them block weapons flags ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
there IS no height
unless you are requesting that we reinvent a basic core idea of how the engine works from the ground up
in which case, no, I don't want to spend 5-7 years rewriting the entire engine to be 3d
