qst file that shows the issue would be helpful

=== @ vlamart 07/14/2022 03:16

Tested on `Map 3`, DMap `12-Level 2 - Moon`, Screen `1E`, and Return Square `A`. The staircase (`Cave (Walk Down) [A]`) warps to the square set on `(136, 16)` on `3:4F`

I couldn't reproduce with the latest build...what version are you using?

=== @ vlamart 07/14/2022 14:50

Build 61, 12th July. I'll update today

=== @ vlamart 07/14/2022 15:22

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I couldn't reproduce with the…"): I just did, did you move return square A on 3:4F to `y==8`? Because that's when it's acting wacky. I think that quest file has the square on `y==16` because that's where it doesn't act (too) weird

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2022 17:22

Nope, I just ran it as is. I'll try again later.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 01:48

ok yea i see it too. 32 and 64 bit. going back a few nightlies to see when it started

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 01:51

happens in nightly-2022-06-29 too
I'm gonna go get some boba now but will continue looking later. in the meantime, if you happen to see this before I get back: would be helpful to try in some of the older alphas and see if it happens there at all

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 01:54

also i'm assuming it did work at one point... any idea about that? maybe its always been a bug

=== @ vlamart 07/15/2022 03:27

I won't be able to test it tonight, but I always remember never really understanding the behaviour of return squares 😝

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 03:51

I built a couple old versions:

`1fc2c396817 apr 19` happens here

I went back to an older build .. `c986d616f96 mar 20` but it was too old to load the same quest, so I  tried to make it happen in a bare-bones classic quest. I couldn't get it to happen in this version or the newest one using just a stupid basic screen and not changing any QRs or dmap shit. So I can't continue bisecting the issue until I know how to repro it with a simple classic quest...

Any ideas what could matter besides the exact position of Ret square A / warp type being instant?

=== @ vlamart 07/15/2022 03:56

#1704

=== @ vlamart 07/15/2022 03:58

I remember discussing something in here about Entrance/Exit types spawning on (0, 0), but didn't test if this behaviour had to do with where the return square is placed.

=== @ vlamart 07/15/2022 04:00

During these warps, does `Game->Scrolling[dir]` or `Link->Action==LA_SCROLLING` have anything to do with it because I do have a simple script that just pushes the player one tile over if they're scrolling (like how NES dungeons do 2 tiles)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 04:00

I'm changing tactics and just gonna set some breakpoints on the screen transition and see whats up
instead of trying to get multiple old versions of ZC to build on my PC / recreate the issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 04:03

(replying to @ vlamart "During these warps, does `Gam…"): uhhhh
I would HOPE not

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 04:28

Uh can you try without the script

=== @ Majora 07/15/2022 05:23

Oh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 05:32

dont think this is a script thing

also this has been here forever
but anyway, imagine y is 0 here. like for your warp. it then goes to -16 for these cave warps
and triggers a transition

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 05:33

Oh ffs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 05:34

This _seems_ like the sort of thing you could just fix w/o a QR?
like surely
no quest relies on this??

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 05:34

Not*that we know of*

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 05:34

like i'm thinking just do a `max(0, ...)` here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 05:36

i guess the idea here is to offset the player a tad if they are spawning onto a cave combo?
dont really get that
I mean, I kinda would get it if it moved the player _down_ but not up
since you typically approach cave combos from the bottom

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 05:38

You typically have the return square 16 px below a cave combo
So it typically moves you up onto the cave combo for the walk animation
I think
Is the idea
Maybe
Too late for brain to brain right now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 05:43

oh wow
So, it does seem like just a visual intent then.
Up to you if you think this needs a QR. lmk  then I'll do it.
or maybe just do it and wait for it to actually seem to break something
idk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 14:28

I think a compat rule would be best
if it broke anything, it would probably be decades old shit we might not hear about for months or years
