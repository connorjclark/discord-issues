Some NES bosses that have multiple NPC components (Patra, Gleeok, Moldorm, Lanmola) appear to have some weird additional HP distribution mechanics that both make setting their HP in the enemy editor unintuitive and can make reading it with scripts awkward. You can see examples of enemies juggling HP values around when used in combination with my Link & Enemy Damage And Healing Numbers script

https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=scripts&id=364

So basically what I'd propose here is a rule that makes it so the values entering in the enemy editor are consistently treated as the HP values _per hitbox_. A Patra with an HP of 1 would have each eye die in one hit, a Gleeok would have the same HP per head and take damage linearly (instead of having heads break in weird patterns of hits like 5-3-3-3). And the segmented enemies wouldn't do whatever awkward jank they are doing.

Of course I know anything involving enemies is godawful. If this HP distribution stuff isn't something that can be reasonably modified feel free to reject in full or in part.

No chance I'm touching this
I've been burned by enemy code enough already

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:32

Kinda figured 😦

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/10/2021 21:32

....if Dimi feels like adding it, I have no problem with that

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:32

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:34

Also @ DeletedUser since this damage numbers bug has been a pain in both our sides with Downfall. IDK if there's any way to fix it in the script but I do imagine having these enemy types behave consistently with the rest of the engine would be a good start

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 21:36

Yeah I could try that
I have no qualms with touching this, but I need to get off my ass and finish Sideview Swimming

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:37

Sounds good. I'm in no particular rush on this, just figured it was a point worth raising
The patra and gleeok calcs in particular gave me grief in LQftH2. I had to fix them with a script 😩

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/10/2021 21:39

unsure if I could actually remove the names of attributes based on QR, so might still have redundant "Head HP" setting

=== @ P-Tux7 09/10/2021 21:44

patras can't have just one number
they have different hp for kids and the core

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:49

It might be possible I made a stupid on that one. Would have to test. The way I remember it, setting HP on both resulted in the enemy not reflecting the values I set

=== @ P-Tux7 09/10/2021 21:49

oh well setting i have no idea
it works this way in z1 and by default in unscripted quest

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:52

Oh!
What the fuck
I set both HP to 1, removed the outer eyes from a Patra 2, same effect
So the outer eyes will die in one hit, inner eyes do not

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:57

WHAT THE FUCK

I've said I hate enemy code before
I should specify
NES bosses
Are about 5000000x worse than normal enemies

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 21:59

yup
At least this one shouldn't be hard to fix right? Ctrl+f for 24 in patra code blocks, find the one setting HP, and make it use the same attribute as the outer eyes?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/10/2021 22:10

twenty bucks that's how patra 2/3 were handled way back when
also i could have sworn one of the 2.55 alphas said something about a bugfix for inner patra eyes...?
should be in the notes because it was before 92

=== @ Moosh 09/10/2021 22:18

Well pre-2.5 I'm pretty sure everything was hardcoded
This particular enemy type I suppose just got overlooked in that transitional period

=== @ Saffith 09/11/2021 01:03

(replying to @ Moosh "At least this one shouldn't b…"): Ha, like we'd just write out the number!
`((enemy*)guys.spr(i))->hp=12*DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER;`
I've got patras up next to rewrite, so I'll take a look at them when I get back to that.

=== @ Moosh 09/11/2021 01:05

...damage multiplier is just 2 isn't it? I guess at least someone somewhere was thinking ahead, just not in the right ways

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/11/2021 11:05

oh
DAMAGE_MULTIPLIER is in init data now
so
