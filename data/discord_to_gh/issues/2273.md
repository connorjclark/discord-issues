Pressing ``F3`` to pause ZC and then pressing ``F4`` to frame advance does not advance the opening wipe while it properly advances other things like music and subscreen scripts.

...I.... thought I specifically fixed this?
is this in the latest nightly?

=== @ Orithan 04/01/2023 01:05

Haven't tested because the current nightlies have their tabs lagging on me

well this was reported and fixed 13 days ago
if you are on builds older than that, then yeah, that'll happen

Alright
That was fixed
But I am in the process of reporting another bug that does not seem to be fixed. One which seems to have to do with the subscreen
