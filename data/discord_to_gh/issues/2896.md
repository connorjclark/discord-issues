If you begin the quest by setting a sword in InitData, and then pick up a sword of a higher level, the slash and stab sprites do not update to the new sword.

If however you start with no sword, then receive it from drop on a screen or from a Special Item guy, the sprites will update normally if you pick up a higher level sword afterwards.

Basic Summary:
- Link starts with Wooden Sword, slash and stab is wooden sword. 
- Link picks up White Sword, slash and stab is still wooden sword.

- Link starts with no sword. Picks up Wooden Sword on screen or from guy. Slash and stab are wooden sword.
- Link gets White Sword on a different screen. Slash and stab update to white sword.

@ Whiterose I could not reproduce this with a new quest, did you?
If you used an existing quest project, it may depend on some QRs.

=== @ Whiterose 12/23/2023 08:13

its still bugged for me even on a new project thats totally new using the latest 2.55 snapshot

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 08:15

Can you upload a qst

=== @ Whiterose 12/23/2023 08:16

Literally all I did was make a new "Modern" quest, set Link's hearts to 16, put the magical sword as an item, and gave link the wooden sword to start.

=== @ Whiterose 12/23/2023 08:18

if he starts with no sword then picks up the magical sword on this screen, then it displays correctly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 08:18

It's easier if you upload a qst please.
Do you still have it?

=== @ Whiterose 12/23/2023 08:18

What, the testing quest?
I jsut made it just now when you said you were unable to recreate it with a new quest and said it might be because of an old file

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 08:19

(replying to @ Whiterose "Swing with wooden sword vs ma…"): Whatever you did to make this

=== @ Whiterose 12/23/2023 08:19

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 08:19

Thanks!

=== @ Whiterose 12/23/2023 08:20

I saved it in the wrong folder
thats why it took a bit to find

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 08:21

confirmed even latest too (3.0)

=== @ Whiterose 12/23/2023 08:22

confirmed?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 08:24

yeah, you reported as 2.55 but I found the issue is in 3.0 too
this is a weird one

=== @ Whiterose 12/23/2023 08:30

thanks god I'm not the weird one

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 08:33

yay found a range
good: A113
bad: A117
time to bisect

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) no clue on this one

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 10:12

i thought this was just a graphical bug but no
the sword itself is unchanged after picking up the next one

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 10:15

tested via using the sword on enemies before and after you pick up the sword, takes the same amount of hits, meaning most likely that the sword either isn't getting replaced, or a lesser probability, the new sword is maintaining the item data of the previous sword

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 10:32

@ Attempt how does the qr `"Old Engine Subscreen Quirks"` affect this?

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 10:32

lesse

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 10:34

the sword changes as it should

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 10:49

so woot a subscreen rewrite issue <a:Kitty_Vibe:915145632702930975>

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 10:50

hahaha, that fixed it?
probably a 1-line typo then

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 10:50

yee

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 11:25

Any chance this (2.55 build, not 3.0 build) fixes it? @ Whiterose @ Attempt

Windows: OH MY GOD A VIRUS
my computer will not let me check that file

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 11:32

?
should be able to click a continue or something

=== @ Whiterose 01/01/2024 11:33

I'm it it will allow me to now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 11:33

the stupid windows antivirus is becoming a virus itself lmao

=== @ Whiterose 01/01/2024 11:33

Technology being technology

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 11:33

honestly this is why I hate antivirus stuff
it is legitimately the highest likely threat to your computer lmao
as long as you aren't someone who goes downloading 500000GB of random torrent stuff from dodgy sources, opening random spam email attachments, etc

=== @ Whiterose 01/01/2024 11:38

Okay so far the graphics are displaying correctly. I checked both starting with a sword and picking up the sword
Now I am going to do one more test with a guy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 11:38

The fun part is, the change I made wasn't even to a line in the commit connor said he narrowed it down to lol
(though, it does deal with the same global variables, so)

=== @ Whiterose 01/01/2024 11:40

Guys also work
if its a special item and you pick it up
tested that because its when I first noticed it happen
so I wanted to check if there was something going on with guys and special item rooms
but all G, seems to be fixed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 11:43

wonderful

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 11:48

also, the 2.55 nightly that'll be out in ~30ish will be basically identical to the build I just sent
(aside from build date, and *having crash reports*, which only github-built builds will have)

=== @ Whiterose 01/01/2024 11:49

neat
I will go and delete the file you sent then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2024 11:50

note that the 3.0 nightly won't have this fix (which, should be obvious, given that it *already came out* just before I fixed this lol)
but next one will

=== @ Attempt 01/01/2024 16:57

works for me too fyi
was dead asleep
