1. ignore health modifier if flipper level is (x) or above
this is basically where if you give the player level 1 flippers, they can still swim but the counter drain is in play. getting the right level of flippers removes it. also, maybe a setting of 0 (or -1?) means that no flippers will stop the effect
2. (rule) disable liquid drain while holding up an item
3. i'm unsure about how to implement this elegantly, but perhaps a drain rate for the liquid that can be divided, instead of it being a binary on or off?
what can liquids even drain right now? is it only health or is it all the counters?

1. you can do that already
but you can use any itemclass, not just flippers

2. probably should fix that
3. that'd be rough
it's only health

oh yeah hmm
i was thinking that using magic (stamina) or a script counter could be used to have an oxygen meter
though, considering it only needs to detect link, a combo script might still be usable for that

The big barrier to adding more stuff to this was a lack of combo arguments, and that has since been fixed
This might happen after the dev break
(division and etc)
