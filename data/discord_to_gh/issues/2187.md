A screen setting that kills every other enemy and projectile once the screen's enemies that are set to beatable are killed. This is to get rid of statues, traps, Bubbles, Zoras, and fireballs in enemy and boss rooms to avoid an unfair death when you think you've beaten the boss. This also makes the boss room non-dangerous to pass through a second time if all the killable enemies are set to not return and thus auto-kill the others upon room entry, which is useful for minibosses without using a DMap Boss Room flag.

(This doesn't apply to damage and Shooter combos, but those can be easily removed via screen secrets)

If this is deemed to be a wasteful use of a flag, a QR could alter the "First Enemy is Ringleader" screen flag to doing this without adding a new flag, since this type of modern design probably would not need to be used by the same old-school quest makers who use Ringleaders.

just for reference

So...how about
combo trigger options
`->Kill Enemies`, `->Clear LWeapons`, `->Clear EWeapons`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 22:49

then instead of a screen flag
you could just have `Enemies->` + `->Kill Enemies` + `->Clear EWeapons`
on a combo in the room

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 22:52

would that work for you @ P-Tux7 ?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 22:58

yeah it would
are combo options more expandable than screen flags?

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 23:02

i thought there were more combos than screens so a bool in combos would take up more space, though given dynamic resizing screens might end up > combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:02

I'm generally more willing to expand triggerflags
as it creates more options for the user, so it leads to more bang for the size it takes

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 23:03

oh, that's a good point

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 23:03

...i ought to look at screen flags and see if there are any that should be ported to combo triggers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:03

`kill_em_all()` is what the `Kill All Enemies` item does when you pick it up, for the record

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 23:03

that is an incredibly good point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:04

`clear`ing a spritelist simply outright deletes everything in it

=== @ P-Tux7 03/29/2023 23:04

hahaha isn't clock or F11 state labelled "superman"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/29/2023 23:04

yeah
invincibility state
