Would be neat to have an in-engine counter cost & effect item. Such that, when used, you can spend MP for HP, or vise-versa, or whatever you decide to set the counters to

You can kinda do this with bottles

Actually, this could also be achieved with #1572

or that
I would probably make a new itemclass specifically for it if it were going to be done that way
though you can do this with bottles right now
except, I still haven't added bottle starting contents to Init Data, so technically you need a script for it still... should fix that.
but basically, if you make an empty bottle for, lets say `slot 26`
and you make slot 26 start with a particular potion inside it
that refills a counter by some amount
but, when used, becomes itself, so it never depletes
and you give that bottle a cost
so that using it costs mp or whatever
viola

Cello, that's dope

....though a new itemclass along the idea of #1572 would be a lot simpler to set up, so probably a good idea too.

you can do this with notes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/26/2022 03:33

oh, eww, true you can
