In the ending screen of any quest for a normal game, Zelda refers to you generically as Hero instead of whatever you entered for the filename.  Presumably this is supposed to be default behavior for if the filename is null for whatever reason?

This is on purpose- we ctrl+f'd link for Hero everywhere for reasons
It does, however, make for awkard language here

Thank goodness "Hyrule" isn't copyrighted either.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/25/2022 22:22

imo we could have stuck with Link here. it's silly to think a lawyer would play to the end of this and see Link and go AHA!

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 22:23

Ah, okay.  Thought it might be related to the other file icon issue I faced or something.

There was a famous-on-reddit video game lawyer...maybe we can hire him for a consult to get this settled once and for all lol
_checks the patreon balance_
yea that aint lawyer money

should probably use the save file name here

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 22:25

But wait, the name "Link" was a legal issue but nothing else was?

`A Hero To The Past`

(replying to @ Mega Moses "But wait, the name "Link" was…"): we're working on it
we'll be holding a contest at some point for new default graphics
and default quests
but we have plenty to get done before it's time for that

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 22:27

Oh wow, interesting

(replying to @ Mega Moses "But wait, the name "Link" was…"): > but nothing else was

keep in mind none of us are lawyers or ever talked to one about this. anything we've done like removing references to Link or changing from Zelda Classic -> ZQuest Classic was a best-guess, defensive measure
altho now I kinda wanna drop a couple hundred bucks to get a real lawyers opinion

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 22:37

Yeah, I imagine it'd end up getting really strange

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 22:40

Guess I'd better hold on to the current default classic module stuff for the future tho lol
