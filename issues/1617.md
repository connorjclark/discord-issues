Would be good if you didn't say extra things
because, uh, being the same family does not seem to be part of the bug at all

I got the bug testing both the Whistle here and the Boomerang in Demo ZX, I guess it goes further than that

I have a very good idea where this broke
however NO idea WHY it broke

...OH
BLEH

So, usually
the expression `!game` is always true in zquest
because the `game` object does not exist
....and I made use of this in updating the subscreen code recently.
Fun fact, `game` object exists during subscreen code! So that doesn't work at all!
so, uh, that just completely broke overrides
should fix
