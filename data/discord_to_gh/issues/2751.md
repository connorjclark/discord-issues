An expansion on the dither options for dark rooms using dither patterns that I have used for a while in my pixel mock-ups.

These look correct for what you'd want?

Sorry I was on babysitting duty.
Discord kind of compresses the images a little but they do look accurate

Actually where the dots meet sometimes puts them a bit closer together

On the edges here
Dont know if thats a discord thing or a ZC thing though

(replying to @ Whiterose "Dont know if thats a discord…"): think that's a ZQ thing just in the preview

=== @ Whiterose 10/17/2023 01:55

Aight then. I am sure it can be troubleshot in game with some adjusted settings
