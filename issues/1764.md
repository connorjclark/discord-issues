@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) you did something with temp files and compiling?
because

those are some weird file names
Any chance you could get that to say `Compiling the buffer` instead?
Used to always be `Compiling 'tmp'`, which, was more understandable than a giant path to a temp folder

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:46

It uses the os temp file convention
Also, can't you make this change how you like it? It's very simple
Just ... Don't print the file name

well that
needs to read the file name, UNLESS it is the buffer
the top one, yeah, duh, that's simple enough to change
but the error messages, not so simple

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:51

Can the idea of a buffer just go away? ZQuest could point at a real file instead?
Ain't no one editing in the buffer
Or if they are bless their souls

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:52

I use the buffer for pretty much every test quest
so

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:52

How?
Say more
Like just to include afile?

All of that was edited in the buffer

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:53

Ok, but why?

Wouldn't you rather have a set of real test scripts on disk somewhere not saved in random quest files

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:53

Sometimes the test script hardcodedly references things in the quest file
so it would be useless outside of that file
and, depending on what I'm doing, I could go through several of these test files in a day
I don't really need to double the number of files cluttering my ZC folder by saving all of those externally

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:55

so, in short, no I would rather not

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:56

Is have the name buffer in the temp file good enough
Otherwise...this whole compiler probably works directly with file paths so changing that for one type of input is probably difficult? But also something I'm not familiar with atm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:57

It would be much better if it could just replace the file name with `buffer` for the temp file
though including the word buffer would be better than it is now

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:58

Well, that's something I know I could do in a minute.
The other thing idk

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/20/2022 20:59

eh, I'll take a look myself then
....

It was already hardcoding that check
actually this should probably be easy

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/20/2022 20:59

Well there you go ez peasy
Just set a global or something if it is from the buffer
Because the exact path will differ based on OS

yep, that was simple enough
(meta) thread name was changed: ✅compile temp dirs
