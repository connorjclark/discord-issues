If you open the combo pages, then edit a combo, then SCROLLWHEEL while in the edit combo dialog, it will scroll to the next combo page when you exit the dialog

Pretty sure it's caching the mouse's Z position
needs to reset the cache when the dialog closes

....it doesn't just do this in the combo pages
it does this in the main fucking window as well
if you rclick->edit combo
