Looks like screen scripts are not executing at all in the latest nightly. Can make example quest if needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2022 14:02

what the fuck????

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 14:03

yeah pretty much my reaction lol

=== @ tacochopper 11/03/2022 14:03

want me to dump my footage here mitch

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 14:04

If you want but I don't want to dump that quest file here because it's a chore to compile it

=== @ tacochopper 11/03/2022 14:04

yeah fair

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2022 14:05

Is the 31st nightly the first one this occurs in?
If not, can you find which one it is please?\

=== @ tacochopper 11/03/2022 14:06

yeah it's the latest. downloaded it today because of unrelated glitches i was having in alpha 110
111/112, b 61, 31st october

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 14:07

Testing others, not broken in Oct 27

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 14:10

Okay, it broke between the Oct 27 and Oct 29 nightlies
and stayed broken through 29/30/31

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 14:12

The script is still slotted and assigned to the screen when opening ZQ.  "Run script at screen init" makeas no difference

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2022 14:28

....I really didn't want to hear that
that's the period I was working on classes
and literally nothing else

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 14:32

Yeah, I was looking through the changelogs and that was the only thing that stood out to me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2022 14:50

....what the fuck
when it goes to check to run the script, it's finding that the current screen's script is `0`
even when it shouldn't be

=== @ tacochopper 11/03/2022 15:00

yikes lol

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 15:04

Wonder if something in classes is somehow overwriting that memory address or something

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2022 15:04

....ok, so
it's actually running the script
for 1 frame
.....but the script is *empty*, so the first command is the QUIT command, which exits/clears the script

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 15:10

The solution is simple
Remove QUIT

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2022 15:10

yes, clearly, and let it run random memory instead
lol
....oh
for
fucks
sake
there's a copy/paste error
it's trying to run a combo script instead of a screen script

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 15:17

Looooooool
That makes sense though with Vlamart's bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2022 15:18

nightly incoming

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 15:18

It's accessing some combodata script trying to get Pos()

=== @ vlamart 11/03/2022 15:18

EXACTLY

=== @ tacochopper 11/03/2022 15:20

yeehaw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/03/2022 15:43

@ mitchfork #deleted-channel

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 17:26

Confirmed fixed for me @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)

=== @ vlamart 11/03/2022 17:26

Same

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 17:28

Did it solve your generic script thing too?

=== @ vlamart 11/03/2022 17:30

Yorp

=== @ mitchfork 11/03/2022 17:31

great
