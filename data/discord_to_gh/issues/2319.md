I've noticed Favorite Combos from older versions of 2.55 zQuest not porting correctly into newer zQuest versions.

113
In 113, it feels like there are favorite combos hidden off the right side?

huh

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/16/2023 19:28

See, originally I was trying to figure out why some Favorite combos were vanishing.

(same quest from above but saved in 133 and stuff done in)
But now I wonder if there is some weird array stuff going on.
As a side effect of this "port"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 19:29

yeah, hmm, methinks I made a mistake somewhere.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 19:30

oh, duh.

you'll need to load the quest from 107 or whenever

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/16/2023 19:53

So... is there any memory concerns from it saving some Favorite Combos in a weird place?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 19:53

no, because it's not saving them in a weird place
it's saving them in a perfectly normal place
I just didn't account for loading old quests favorite combos properly
(Due to the ability to resize the favorite combo window, I made the area wider than it can be visually- just to be safe that it won't somehow *display from out of bounds memory*)
(better to have extra unused good memory there just incase)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/16/2023 19:55

Okay then. So there was no memory issues. But then that means there may actually be a different bug that randomly cleared some favorite combos, and I have no idea when it happened.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 19:58

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ HeroOfFireZC"): ^Does this work properly?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/16/2023 20:04

Looks like it's correct.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 20:09

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "Okay then. So there was no me…"): if you find anything, report it separately with whatever info

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/16/2023 20:31

So, one question. What about quests already saved in 113? Are there still favorite combos inaccessible somewhere, or are the ones I see the only ones saved?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/16/2023 20:37

there might be some inaccessbile
(my bad)
(hard to fix without possibly mangling it if people already fixed it though...)
