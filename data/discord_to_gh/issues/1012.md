1. Test quest: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qVcAgOzrdR5wjVBoazz4dOXhXgC0E1ed/view?usp=sharing
2. Stand on moving platform.
3. Try to hookshot grab combos behind solid block, while riding platforn.

If hookshot head hits solid wall while returning after missed shot, weird things happened with chain rendering.

```ffc script moving{
    void run(){
        while (true){
            if (RectCollision(Link->X+6, Link->Y+6 ,Link->X+11, Link->Y+11, this->X, this->Y, this->X + this->EffectWidth, this->Y + this->EffectHeight)){
                if (Link->Z == 0){
                    Link->X += this->Vx;
                    Link->Y += this->Vy;
                }
            }
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```

I had problems with this back when I was making LaZPoC too. It was so bad I actually made my chain blank and drew a new one, but that's not a great solution
I think just moving the hookshot's position at all screwed up the chain drawing quite a bit
(since I did that to make the screen-wraparound hookshot)

Oh god this is a weird one
It... looks like its morphing into a diagonal hookshot?
what the hell...

okay, nevermind, figured out why it might bug out
really easy fix

(meta) thread name was changed: ✅🔒Janky hookshot chain rendering, when hero`s position is altered by script

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/10/2021 16:30

For those curious: there's a hookshot startx and a hookshot starty variable, and whenever stuff like conveyors move link, it updates those... but it wasn't being updated for the script move functions.

Is it possible to do this fix in 2.53.x branch, or 2.53.1 beta 55 is already final?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/10/2021 17:07

Possibly, yeah
