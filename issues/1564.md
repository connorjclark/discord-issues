This is my script:
```// NOTE: You'll need to set ZScript->Quest Script Settings->Script->Combos Run Scripts on Layer ... (whatever layer you want these combos to run on)

@Author("TheBlueTophat")
combodata script dynamic_overhead
{
    void run()
    {
        while(true)
        {
            if(Player->Y <= this->Y && Player->Y > (this->Y - this->InitD[0]))
            {
                Screen->FastCombo(3, this->X, this->Y, this->ID, this->CSet, OP_OPAQUE);
            }
            
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
Seems that this->CSet is returning 0 rather than 2. Note: I found this in A104.

oh for fucks sake
zoria doesn't know how to implement anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:13

err
so @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345)
that's cset2
the cset the combo is placed in isn't part of combodata, it's part of the *screen*
given, it's also returning the cset2 with the wrong bitwise shit, so it's still broken, but it isn't even what you want to begin with

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/24/2022 01:16

Oh strange
Assuming the bitwise shift was proper, what is it actually supposed to return then?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:18

err, well, for a combo with nothing set it should return 0
the problem is that the 4 bits for the 4 selected corners are also part of what's returned

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/24/2022 01:20

Wait, so `this->CSet` returns the `CSet2` box information???
<:orangebruh:783600717247283232>

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:20

the cset2 field and the cset2 box

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/24/2022 01:20

That seems so counter intuitive, especially since the position part worked fine and is analogous to what I would expect to be returned

The `CSet` was added before combodata scripts were even thought of
and again, Zoria has no sense for common sense
keep in mind though that `Pos` ONLY works for `this->` in combodata scripts
and does not work for any combodata that is not `this->`
or in any other script type

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/24/2022 01:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "keep in mind though that `Pos…"): can you elaborate what you mean
so if I did something like, `combodata combo = Game->LoadComboData(blah blah blah);` I wouldn't be able to get the `combo->Pos` of that?
only from within the combodata script itself when using the `this->` pointer
?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:24

correct
because if I load combo 52
....that combo could be placed in 50 different positions on the same screen
so how the hell would it know what to return?
Combodata *SCRIPTS* run with a specific position, so they can return that value

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/24/2022 01:26

Okay, noted

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:26

same for `Layer`
and `X`/`Y`
```
int Layer();
int Layer;
 * Returns the layer the combo is on in a combodata script, from the 'this->' pointer as 'this->Layer()'
 * Using this from any other combodata variable is illegal and undefined.

int Pos();
int Pos;
 * Returns the combo screen index of a combo from a combodata script, from the 'this->'
 * pointer as 'this->Pos()'.
 * Using this from any other combodata variable is illegal and undefined.
 * Read-only

int PosX();
int X;
 * Returns the X-coordinate of a combo from a combodata script, from the 'this->'
 * pointer as 'this->PosX()'.
 * Using this from any other combodata variable is illegal and undefined.
 * Read-only

int PosY();
int Y;
 * Returns the Y-coordinate of a combo from a combodata script, from the 'this->'
 * pointer as 'this->PosY()'.
 * Using this from any other combodata variable is illegal and undefined.
 * Read-only```
it does specify this in all of their docs
and if it seems odd, blame Zoria.

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/24/2022 01:29

what do you think would be the cleanest way to go about doing what I'm trying to do then from within the combodata script?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:29

```cpp
mapdata tmpdata = Game->LoadTempScreen(this->Layer);
int cs = tmpdata->ComboC[this->Pos];```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:31

the placed flag would be `tmpdata->ComboF[this->Pos]`

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/24/2022 01:32

Awesome, thanks.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/24/2022 01:32

fun thing is, `LoadTempScreen(0)` gives you a mapdata pointer that works just like `Screen->`
so, for any layer 0-6 that gives you a direct temp pointer

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 04/24/2022 01:38

That's nice. That would be useful for looping through each layer to do stuff.
