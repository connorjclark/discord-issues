Yes, your scripts are a lot of the inspiration, so that more people can use the features in their quests who aren't knowledgeable with importing scripts. And also the AI improvements can come with the default tileset to make the enemies fairer and better.
Because Emily banned scripts in the default tileset so all improved AI needs to be in-engine to see the most users using it and to make more quests funner.
