I have been unable to reproduce this intentionally, but on several occasions now, I've witnessed Lynels managing to seemingly navigate through completely solid tiles. All instances of this seem to be while entering the solid tile from the north. I've only seen it happen 3 times, 2 times happening while ZC is running in the background.

It seems to happen more consistently if the tile to the north of the fully solid combo is partially solid

Can you provide a replay? It'll be more likely to be fixed if we can recreate it on demand.
