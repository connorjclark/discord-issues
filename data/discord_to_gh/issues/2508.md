Just downloaded the build July 8th, around 6pm cst, and all lists are really slow such as scrolling through the dmap list, enemies list, etc (oddly enough not the item list). Have not seen this before this build
SCrolling through by hovering is fine

once opening it it is laggy

There was a bandaid solution implemented so that the programs don't boil CPUs by constantly redrawing every single frame from complete scratch. I believe this is purely visual, the lag, and you can still keyboard wizard it accurately.

that isnt what I am seeing, whether I scroll or keyboard it is still laggy

It was just the mouse wheel for this component type, FYI
missed that one

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 06:21

all components now have to set a "this needs to be redrawn" bit when something changes, which tells our allegro 5 code to redraw the screen. Otherwise, because I knew i'd miss something, I set it to redraw at least once every 15 frames, which is why it looks laggy here.

Another I found is the Doors dialog

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 06:44

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/10/2023 01:32

=== @ Deathrider 07/10/2023 02:15
