Kind of in the title. Instead of figuring out how to put in the include paths for ZScript, just make it a path we can chose in C:// (I hope I wrote that right lol)

All the specific ways of remembering how to do it suck for basic-ers like me, you know it's a good idea deep down üòõ

the problem is I don't think any of our file selector code is built to select folders
