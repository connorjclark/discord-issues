=== @ Attempt 11/20/2023 06:20

Sometimes quests with enhanced music tends to peak with some songs when they start, the volume going beyond the ZC Player's limits.
Journey into the Novel Ruins and Canaria, the Upwind March where i encountered the issue.

=== @ Attempt 11/20/2023 07:48

nvm i guess. it's a sound compatibility thing :p

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/22/2023 10:16

this temporarily fixes itself when you go into the ZC volume control (it'll revert the song to non-earrape)
maybe a volume variable is getting set to max somewhere?

=== @ Attempt 11/22/2023 11:20

mhm, it seems that it only occurs to scripted music changes, like a boss theme script or something so it could very well be

=== @ Attempt 11/22/2023 11:29

and it seems related to the compatibility rule where the script's music volume  affects the zc player volume rather than the music's internal volume since it seems to only occurs on builds before the fix.

=== @ Attempt 11/22/2023 11:50

so before alpha 117

=== @ Moosh 11/22/2023 21:38

fffuck
what script in particular is doing this?

=== @ Attempt 11/22/2023 23:58

no clue, all i know is that it seems to happen via enhanced music changes not caused by typical dmap warps or other in-engine methods of music swapping, at least i haven't encountered any that would do so.

=== @ Attempt 11/23/2023 00:05

tbh it could be for midi music changes too, the music's too loud to really identify it

=== @ Attempt 11/23/2023 00:28

and i can't seem to replicate it using scripts in the database
so i could just be all wrong about it being scripted music changes or it could be because they're using their own script, whatever that could be
or...i don't even know

could be completely wrong from the start

Could be related to loading a quest with this QR on/off then a second with it opposite.... the ffscript volume not being re-initialized... just a guess

more details from example qst provided by Phosphor https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876954819305275433/1178927986939003000

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/28/2023 05:54

as a bandaid, in zcmusic_set_volume / zcmusic_play, we could cap `vol` to 255.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/28/2023 07:53

Stared at the volume code for an hour and got nowhere

except for the small realization that some places (like read_saves...) check the QR for old script volume, but in title screen default.qst is always loaded so that code never runs ü§∑

=== @ Phosphor 11/28/2023 17:32

The bug consistently happens on a fresh installation of ZC with default settings

=== @ Phosphor 11/28/2023 17:34

The bug consistently happens during the session, then ceases upon restarting the entire exe with non-default settings
Restarting the program after changing the sound settings seems to always cause the music be much more inconsistent, randomly choosing between peaking the music, playing the music normally, or not playing it at all.

=== @ Phosphor 11/28/2023 17:40

Upon further testing, it's *always* random whether or not the music peaks, even on the first session, so changing the settings doesn't seem to be affecting it?

=== @ Phosphor 11/28/2023 17:46

I logged to see if there was any kind of pattern to it and there isn't, other than a slight bias towards peaking the music. 43% of the time it plays normally while the other 57% of the time results in peaking it. I was only able to observe it playing no music once off-camera.
I'm suspecting it's down to what frame you enter the screen or something

=== @ Phosphor 11/28/2023 17:55

So what if the issue is that the FFC script controlling the music is getting called every frame for a set time window? I noticed you can achieve the exact same clipping effect by layering the music on top of itself 60 times.

=== @ Phosphor 11/28/2023 18:05

So I suspect this may be the cause.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2023 04:38

On my windows machine, tried a local release/debug build and the official latest 2.55 build, stil can't repro this

I'm using the exact folder above. does this repro for you? maybe I need the music for Forest Temple too (just have boss music, so forest temple section is no music)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2023 04:40

omg yup that was it. I just added a random mp3 to the forest temple dmap I had locally, and now it goes off like a christopher nolan film in the boss room

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2023 04:56

Release mode, it is loud. Debug mode, it is silent. üëÄ

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2023 04:59

in the debug case (cuz I can actually inspect the data), when playing the mp3 that results in silence, the volume is `0` because `zcmusic->fadevolume` is somehow  `-842150451`. AKA 0x32323233. AKA --- obvious sign of an uninitialized value. Explains the randomness.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2023 05:03

(part of) the root cause - we gotta nix all these usages of malloc for structs üëÄ

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/29/2023 05:24

btw https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/346eec0325abe94ed9612304896cb14e273fbda5/src/zc/zc_sys.cpp#L8246-L8260 is the place where ZCMUSIC got created, but fadevolume was never initialized (like other calls to `zcmusic_load_for_quest` do)

I pushed a fixed to my fork, when it passes CI I'll do a new release soon.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2023 04:37

@ Phosphor is this fixed for you?

=== @ Phosphor 11/30/2023 04:37

Did you commit this to the 2.55 builds?
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2023 04:39

yes

=== @ Phosphor 11/30/2023 04:39

I'll check in a little bit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/30/2023 04:49

I haven't noticed it since upgrading
good catch!

=== @ Phosphor 11/30/2023 22:31

Still having issues here
No more peaking, however I'm having an issue where scripts fail to call enhanced music entirely until I leave and re-enter a screen/dmap

=== @ Phosphor 11/30/2023 22:35

Recorded it

THe first two attempts behave as expected, then all subsequent attempts play no music

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/01/2023 00:47

dest dmap has `fadeinframes` of 0, moving from original dmap w/ `fadeoutframes` of 2. To start, `play_enh_music_crossfade` puts the old music to fade volume 100% and new to fade volume 0%

then, `zcmixer.cpp` update function will only run the `if(mix->fadeoutframes)` branch. This only adjusts the old music fade volume _down_. The new music remains at 0 throughout.

@ Moosh is the bug here that `fadeinframe === 0` is setting the new music to 0% fade volume?
