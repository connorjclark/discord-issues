Encountered this in CUM. If you're holding up when you activate a save point combo or (or the scripted save menu) it'll interpret the held up input as an up press and defaults to quit. This isn't a serious issue since it still gives a warning prompt unlike retry in the F6 menu. But it is a bit of a jumpscare to almost throw away all my progress.
