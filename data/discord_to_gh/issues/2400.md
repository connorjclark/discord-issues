Small std_functions oversight. Weapons created with the new fast weapon creation functions don't default to having a direction if fired at an angle. This can mess with shields (scripted and I believe vanilla as well) and weapons with sprites that vary based on direction. They should probably each use AngleDir4() after setting their angle (as 4-directional weapons are far more common) so they don't all read as up facing
