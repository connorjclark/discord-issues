Okay so I'm starting a general progress blog on this in the hopes that embarrassment from not posting anything on a given day will motivate me to finish this stupid feature.
Currently, sideview swimming has actions for:
swimming
slashing
stabbing
pounding
charging
that last one I just did earlier today
Currently, I'm looking at charging being cancelled if you push forward in a direction too long (I think it's hopping code not being updated for sideview swimming)

progress todo before I call this feature complete (will add stuff as I think of it):

remaining actions (holding and casting, maybe more)
left/right facing only (no upwards or downwards facing, LA-style)
swim gravity (only applies when not moving, separate from regular gravity. Could even be negative if you want link to float to the surface)
sideview swim speed (should have 3 different speeds: horizontal, upwards, and downwards)
exiting jump height (if exiting from the top)
(meta, MessageType.pins_add)

haven't touched this because of computer peril, but computer peril is over so uh, back to this at some point

Long time since last update, but uh, new charger doesn't seem to be lasting. Seems I might have to take computer in for repairs at some point
On a more positive note, sideview swimming is pretty much done. The only thing left is the holding and casting sprite.
