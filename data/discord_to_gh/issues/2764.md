An option to scale screenshots saved via the editor/player to 2x, 3x, etc. Images shared on Discord in particular are hard to see at 1x on most monitors.

I know that this isn't the ideal solution to this, but this is why I always install the Browser Addon "ImageZoom."  It's an absolute life-saver for things like this.  I cannot browse without it.  I just can't.

It might have some other name, but it's similar or related.  "Zoom Image" is the name of the one I have installed on Firefox right now.

Is it important to keep at 1x for default?

=== @ mitchfork 10/19/2023 22:09

I would probably keep at 1x defualt just since that's best for exprting/ripping for ZC use

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/19/2023 23:05

Is that the only reason? Cuz we could detect that maybe and scale it back down perhaps...

=== @ mitchfork 10/20/2023 03:37

Dunno, might be good to get other opinions. I feel like I would set to 2x as my personal default and then back down as needed

=== @ Russ 10/20/2023 16:17

If we could rip from 2x, I‚Äôd be cool with that as default
But otherwise yeah, it‚Äôs annoying changing settings to get rippable tiles

=== @ mitchfork 10/20/2023 16:24

I could see a button in the grabber menu that lets you scale down the loaded image, but that doesn't seem trivial with preserving the exact pixel/palette data

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/21/2023 01:33

I'm not certain but I don't think it actually would be that hard to do either of those things. Those are already a thing with the build-in tile scaling feature.
I agree though, I'd prefer a larger export size if it was easy to scale things down when importing them,

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2023 00:05

does "ripping" mean grabbing a tile and grabbing a cset?
cset should be unchanged - it's just bigger pixels, same pal being saved
grabbing a tile...yeah that'd be bad if scaled up
i don't believe there is a scale-down feature currently in the tile grabber

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2023 00:08

though I did manage to grab a blown up tile into 2x2 tiles, select all 4 in tile page, right click scale'd down to 1, and it worked üòõ

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2023 00:11

Ideally the grabber step would offer a way to scale down/up by some amount. I don't have time to do that though - is it fine if we put the default to 2x (or 3x?) for these screen snapshots? Can find time in future to support scaling in the grabber.

my thinking is that as long as it is configurable that should be OK for now for quest creators ... but if the default remains 1x  we won't get the main benefit of ppl no longer uploading bitmaps for ants

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2023 00:33

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "though I did manage to grab a‚Ä¶"): yes, this is intentionally a feature

=== @ mitchfork 11/05/2023 00:34

...I didn't know that was a thing
Does it just use the top left pixel of each block?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2023 00:35

^ yep, pretty much

=== @ mitchfork 11/05/2023 00:35

Makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2023 00:35

no smarts to it
works well enough for most use cases
and works perfectly for downscaling something that was blown up

=== @ mitchfork 11/05/2023 00:35

I feel like adding smarts would make it worse yeah
In that case I'm fine with a 2/3 default

order is backwards, but this is 1-5 x
4 and 5 look same in discord for me on my resolution
1024x704 is 4x

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 05:26

Done!
