With this configuration that bottom trap must think it is colliding against that corner wall and instead of moving right to collide with the wall it immediately goes left. FYI this behavior is not present in 2.50.2

@ Moosh didn't you find this too in z3 build a few weeks ago?
but you found it wasn't related to z3 changes

I did find something funky with traps though that was to do with layers. I don't think this is related to that? My fix for the other issue was checking the move flag that uses script movement instead of engine
