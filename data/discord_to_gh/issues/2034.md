Basically I set up the shooter combo correctly but the fireball refuses to move from it's spawnpoint in the shooter combo, that is not ideal. The projectiles should move from the shooter combo regardless of solidity.

@ FireSeraphim ....those shooters have a `speed` of `0`
so of course the fireballs aren't moving
I see no bug here at all

upon giving both shooters a step speed, it works perfectly fine

';

=== @ FireSeraphim 11/17/2022 23:58

Wha? where's the speed option, I didn't see that in there.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2022 23:58

attributes
(there is a very blatant scroll bar.....)

=== @ FireSeraphim 11/17/2022 23:59

Oh, my apologies. Feel free to report it as a false positive

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2022 23:59

this is the 857245th time someone has missed the scrollbar there and made a bug report
I really don't understand
how it's so hard to see that scrollbar
lol
like, is there anything I could change visually to make it stand out better?
it's the same as every other scrollbar in the program
but specifically THAT scrollbar people keep missing
....maybe I can just force the combo editor to be a bit taller in large mode
because you can see exactly all the attribytes/shorts without scrolling, and can't see the attributes at all
that's probably the issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/18/2022 00:03

maybe I should just change it to subtabs again....

=== @ mitchfork 11/19/2022 13:50

I think it's just the only tab where there's a scrollbar like that, honestly
Or if there's another tab with one, I don't remember it

=== @ mitchfork 11/19/2022 13:54

And yeah, the fact that it cleanly cuts off the bottom options doesn't help because it doesn't look like anything is missing
Subtabs would probably be the way to go, but yeah, it has seemed like it comes up quite often

=== @ Majora 11/19/2022 14:08

Perhaps make it wider or make it flash for 3 seconds or make the bar part that moves a vivid color. Just throwing ideas out there.
