A combo that can be set to make Link jump when it is triggered, only if his z=0.  "Bounce" instead of "Jump" is intended to convey that the jump is forced upon the player by the engine and is not necessarily player-prompted.
Uses:
-A special combo that makes the player jump when they press a button on it, but without allowing them to jump in any area like they can with the Roc's Feather. A similar scripted combo is seen in Eiyuu.
-A special combo that can be triggered by an existing weapon such as the Hammer or Stomp Boots, launching the player to bigger heights than the ordinary Roc's Feather could. This could be considered the top-down equivalent of a springboard in platformer games.
-Small jumps during a cutscene to simulate tremors or surprise.
-An involuntary jump forced upon the player to simulate earthquakes. This could make quite the setpiece in escape sequences or bosses, for example.

Flags:
-Triggers Stomp Boots: The effects of Stomp Boots in the inventory are used for this jump.
-Triggers Hover Boots: The effects of Hover Boots in the inventory are used for this jump.
-Extra Roc Jumps Enabled: If the player has a Roc's Feather that has 2 or more jumps, then they may make (n - 1) additional jumps in the air as if they had jumped themselves. If not, they cannot do additional jumps while being bounced by this combo.

Attributes:
-Height: How much of a jump the jump is, like you would set on a Roc's Feather.
-Velocity X: A possible idea where the player's movement is disabled and they are forced to be thrown in such a velocity by the combo until they land. See the diagonal springs in Sonic games for a similar idea.
-Velocity Y: See above
-Hover Time: See below. 0 = no hover


I am unsure if the player can be made to hover without actually owning Hover Boots. If this is possible, it might also be possible to use this as a "hover boot launch pad" that gives you a jump with an attribute set for a "free" length of hover, similar to those tornadoes in Minish Cap.

These literally could not be optional, these are part of link's movement, not part of the thing that initiates the jump
...this.... sounds difficult to do right.

=== @ P-Tux7 04/02/2023 03:16

that's fair, this certainly isn't essential

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/02/2023 13:34

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "> -Triggers Hover Boots: The…"): you could set a flag that disables both of these if the combo bounces Link; it doesn't sound impossible necessarily
Might look at this if I have energy when my computer comes back

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/02/2023 17:01

yeah, though I certainly wouldn't make those SEPARATE flags

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/02/2023 17:03

if I were to do that, I would make it a `Cutscene Jump` flag- prevents you from moving, hovering, or multi-jumping during the bounce, which takes you to the set X/Y position (or with set x/y speed? same idea)
...also what the hell are the stomp boots meant to do?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/02/2023 17:33

They damage enemies when you land on them, and optionally make you bounce upwards
think goomba stomp

....?

=== @ P-Tux7 04/02/2023 19:25

i knew that "does this combo activate your hover boots if you have them" would be a desired customization and i put in stomp boots to be consistent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/02/2023 19:38

what would the stomp boots DO? like, what do you want that flag to do?

=== @ P-Tux7 04/02/2023 23:18

oh, it means that it allows your stomp boots to take effect if you have them
it is unimportant and can be paid no mind
i think the much more important of the two is the "if you have hover boots, use them" flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 01:20

If I were to add this, it would basically be:
-When triggered, bounce the player in the air (give them a set jump value) - hover/multijump/etc would work as normal.
OR
-When triggered, bounce the player in a specific arc to a new specific location - hover/multijump would not work, it's a "cutscene bounce".

Stomp boots...just...are what happens when you land on an enemy. They would not be related at all.

```
Type: Bounce Pad
Help: When triggered with 'ComboType Effects', bounces the player. Optionally perform a forced 'cutscene bounce'.
Flag 0: Jump value is Feather hardcode - the attribyte used for jump is either direct, or uses the feather hardcode of '(jump+2)*80'.
Flag 1: 'Cutscene Bounce' - on trigger of a cutscene bounce, the player's position is locked exactly to the bounce combo's, and the player then bounces in a set way, without control.
Flag 2: Ignore Solidity - used for 'Cutscene Bounce'. If not set, hitting an obstruction during the jump will cancel it on the spot, causing you to fall. Otherwise, solids are ignored during cutscene jumps.
Attribyte 0: Bounce Jump - same as roc's feather? add a flag like roc's feather for different options?
Attribyte 1: Bounce XDiff + Attribyte 2: Bounce YDiff - used for 'Cutscene Bounce'- the player will bounce from the bounce pad to the location exactly '+xdiff,+ydiff' from the bounce pad's location.```
@ P-Tux7 How does this sound as a basic write-up?

=== @ P-Tux7 04/03/2023 01:36

yes, that cutscene bounce idea is a very smart way to implement it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 01:40

this then also needs a global way to track if a cutscene-bounce is in progress
....I could probably tie that into the cutscene trigger internal workings
make a cutscene bounce just trigger a cutscene trigger effect, with some flags set

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 01:42

eh, probably not the exact cutscene trigger workings, but I can generify how that works a bit more
this is a big feature, so, might be a while before I get around to trying it, but with a good outline typed up the idea won't be forgotten.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 02:18

(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ P-Tux7 04/03/2023 02:23

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "eh, probably not the exact cu…"): oh yeah, a "cutscene" status would be nice, and would give the infrastructure link's handling for the jump for z3 cliffs
(not that i've ever particularly wanted those, but i know it's been discussed in devnotes before)

=== @ P-Tux7 04/03/2023 02:41

oh right, and the wallbonk for pegasus boots as well, which i'm more hyped for

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 04/03/2023 14:40

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "If I were to add this, it wou…"): Okay, but what about a bounce where you have control but hover boots don't activate?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 15:54

that's.... weird jank to code workarounds and hardcodes into the system for
I would rather not clutter the code with that if it isn't necessary
