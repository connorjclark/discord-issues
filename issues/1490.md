Right now it seems restricted to Level 3 on classic quests and can only be turned off by compat rules.  What if you had the burning desire to use it on a different colored level somewhere else?

what does this even do
and why is it worth the amount of effort it would take

Replaces indexed colour #XXX (one of the CSet 6 ones) with a hardcoded colour (it's not even a Misc. Colour IIRC) if the current DMap's Level is 3 *and* the Level 3 CSet 6 Fix is off
Under NESFix
Though yeah like, I think that's a waste of a flag

I can see an argument for per-DMap atmospheric Link palettes but just making his skin lighter - and a hardcoded colour at that - is NOT the way to do it.

(And due to Ring palettes would be a headache to implement)

ah, it is an NES fixes.
So, general rule of thumb
NES fixes stuff are fixing NES bugs
and, that's all there is to them
nothing else will be added for them
