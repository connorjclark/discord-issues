=== @ Moosh 10/07/2021 08:13

Itemdata scripts have a 1 frame delay after the first frame of operation when called from an item. This delay is not present when using itemdata->RunScript().

=== @ Moosh 10/07/2021 08:14

```itemdata script Test{
    void run(){
        for(int i=0; i<10; ++i){
            Trace(i);
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
You can use this script with frame advance to see the behavior in action. On the second frame the script runs it will not print anything and then will resume printing where it left off on the third.

Here's a link to the full discussion I had with Zoria on the issue.

Try replacing these functions with the ones in this file. It may solve it and has cleaner logic.

Rearranged some more logic and added some extra sanity checks.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 09:46

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Please try a build with this replacing `bool FFScript::itemScriptEngine()` and `bool FFScript::itemScriptEngineOnWaitdraw()` in `ffscript.cpp` and LMK if it fixes this frame No 2 bug without introducing new issues.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 09:55

Hmm, no
still skips a frame

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 09:56

Ahha
fixedlocally
change
In `zelda.cpp`, move this
```if ( !FFCore.system_suspend[susptITEMSCRIPTENGINE] )  FFCore.itemScriptEngine(); //run before lweapon scripts
    ```
under
```c
if ( !FFCore.system_suspend[susptLINK] )
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < (gofast ? 8 : 1); i++)
        {
            #if LOGGAMELOOP > 0
        al_trace("game_loop is at: %s\n", "if(Link.animate(0)\n");
        #endif
            if(Link.animate(0))
            {
            if(!Quit)
            {
                //set a B item hack
                //Bwpn = Bweapon(Bpos);
                Quit = qGAMEOVER;
            }
            
            return;
            }
            
            checklink=false;
        }
    }```
so you want this
```c
if ( !FFCore.system_suspend[susptLINK] )
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < (gofast ? 8 : 1); i++)
        {
            #if LOGGAMELOOP > 0
        al_trace("game_loop is at: %s\n", "if(Link.animate(0)\n");
        #endif
            if(Link.animate(0))
            {
            if(!Quit)
            {
                //set a B item hack
                //Bwpn = Bweapon(Bpos);
                Quit = qGAMEOVER;
            }
            
            return;
            }
            
            checklink=false;
        }
    }
    
    if ( !FFCore.system_suspend[susptITEMSCRIPTENGINE] )  FFCore.itemScriptEngine(); //run before lweapon scripts
    ```
that was the timing issue @ Moosh h

=== @ Moosh 10/07/2021 10:01

Would this further complicate the script timings as indicated in the doc?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 10:01

I did not test all of this with passive items,but I believe that the new logicis better
IDK
passive items can be separated out into their own functions and run prior to Link which would be best
needs a new suspendtype
a compat rule to suspend both passive and active items with general item suspend and some minor rewrites
this change alone may need a compat rule'Old Itemdata Script Timing' for older 2.55 quests

=== @ Moosh 10/07/2021 10:04

Hmm...according to ZScript_Timing.txt, item action scripts should already be under Link.animate()?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 10:05

but passive items should ultimately run before Link
this only affects 2nd frame or later of active items and when passive item scripts begin
the latter is a possible problem
the first frame of an actively used item still occurs in Link.animate
this also changes the timing for when itemdata->Runscript happens including its first frame.
so that may also need to be broken off and run with passive items

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 10:09

I found the problem and documented what needs to be done
**1.** need a suspend type for passive items with a rule to link that to suspending items in general

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 10:10

**2. **need a second function pair just for passive and runscript items
placed before Link in zelda.cpp
**3.** the core `itemscriptengine`  otherwise must be after Link in zelda.cpp

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 10:13

**4.**Test the revised functions with passive stuff.
**5. **Test it all with waitdraw.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 12:50

So, what particular reason do passive items run *before* link for?
Would it not make sense to have all items run at the same time?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 12:58

You missed an important `if ( !itemScriptsWaitdraw[q] ) continue;` in your code block

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:06

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:47

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "So, what particular reason do…"): passive scripts that affect his tile

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:47

. . . and? Why would they need to run before his animate for that?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:47

such as armour

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:47

They'd need to run before his draw
but I see no reason they'd need to run before his animate for that

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:48

his draw is inside his animate

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 13:49

....no it isn't??

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:54

Look at game_loop
where is it originating  if not from Link.animate()

5 different times
`draw_screen` is where *all* draws originate from

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 13:58

oh
very good then it can simply run after him and should be fine
I'm forgetting things rather easily at this point

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:08

butwait
is his base tile and/or scripttile not set in his animastion subroutine?
Am I that far gone?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:09

ScriptTile would not be
base tile would be
so, in fact, I'd think you'd want to run the script *after* that, so it can detect his tile change, and do something based on it
i.e. `Hero->ScriptTile = Hero->Tile+20;`
that would *not* work if run before his animate

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:10

then the cange tat Isuggestedisfine
although I would still advise a timing change rule
as I did for global scripts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:11

aye, of course

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:11

I also see where I missed the waitdraw check

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895584589941202964/895675033068904458/itemScriptEngine.cpp?ex=65e9cb60&is=65d75660&hm=4913cf70ada497d17f409ab831833ace83db322a7b57f6338b46d807367a0c79&

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:14

why do it in the if
and then in the else
why not just do it *before* the if
also the passive is missing a `doscript` check entirely

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:17

the passive doesn't need doscript
it's an item flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:17

. . . then what happens if the script isn't an infinite loop, and terminates?
script termination works by setting `doscript` to `0`
given, having a non-infinite-loop-passive doesn't make much *sense*

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:18

I'll go bac and loo at the original functins after I SLEEP
pretty sure that they never checked that
for that exact reason
but they can call quit
so
perhaps they did

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:19

`if ( item_doscript[q] < 1 ) continue;` is at the top of the loop in the old code
so was checked for *everything*
funnily enough, this block
```cpp
else if(item_doscript[q]==0)  //Item script ended. Clear the data, if any remains.
{
    itemScriptData[q].Clear();
    FFScript::deallocateAllArrays(SCRIPT_ITEM, q);
    itemscriptInitialised[q] = 0;
    continue;
}
```
will never run
because if doscript is 0 it does `continue;` earlier

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:20

```c
FFScript::itemScriptEngine()
{
    if ( FFCore.system_suspend[susptITEMSCRIPTENGINE] ) return false;
    //zprint("Trying to check if an %s is running.\n","item script");
    for ( int q = 0; q < MAXITEMS; q++ )
    {
        
        //zprint("Checking item ID: %d\n",q);
        if ( itemsbuf[q].script <= 0 || itemsbuf[q].script > NUMSCRIPTITEM ) continue; // > NUMSCRIPTITEM as someone could force an invaid script slot!
        
        #if DEVLEVEL > 0
        if ( runningItemScripts[q] == 3 ) //forced to run perpetually by itemdata->RunScript(int mode)
        {
            zprint("The item script is still running because it was forced by %s\n","itemdata->RunScript(true)");
            //ZScriptVersion::RunScript(SCRIPT_ITEM, itemsbuf[q].script, q & 0xFFF);
        }
        #endif
        
        //Passive items
        if ( ( (itemsbuf[q].flags&ITEM_FLAG16) && game->item[q] && (get_bit(quest_rules, qr_ITEMSCRIPTSKEEPRUNNING)) ) )
        {
            //zprint("ItemScriptEngine() reached a point to call RunScript for item id: %d\n",q);
            ZScriptVersion::RunScript(SCRIPT_ITEM, itemsbuf[q].script, q&0xFFF);
            continue;
            
        }
        else
        {
        ```
that is why I removed code that never runs
passive item scripts have alwas been this way

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:22

?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/07/2021 14:23

the function at present in 2.55 does not have a condition to end them
as they trigger on a completely differentbasis
and you can terminate them by unsetting their flag or by removing the item

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2021 14:24

```cpp
case SCRIPT_ITEM:
{
    zprint("Item script reached quit/end of scope\n");
    int new_i = 0;
    bool collect = ( ( i < 1 ) || (i == COLLECT_SCRIPT_ITEM_ZERO) );
    new_i = ( collect ) ? (( i != COLLECT_SCRIPT_ITEM_ZERO ) ? (i * -1) : 0) : i;
    
    if ( !collect )
    {
        if ( (itemsbuf[i].flags&ITEM_FLAG16) && game->item[i] ) itemsbuf[i].script = 0; //Quit perpetual scripts, too.
        item_doscript[new_i] = 0;
        for ( int q = 0; q < 1024; q++ ) item_stack[new_i][q] = 0xFFFF;
        itemScriptData[new_i].Clear();
    }
    else
    {
        item_collect_doscript[new_i] = 0;
        for ( int q = 0; q < 1024; q++ ) item_collect_stack[new_i][q] = 0xFFFF;
        itemCollectScriptData[new_i].Clear();
    }
    FFScript::deallocateAllArrays(SCRIPT_ITEM, new_i);
    zprint("Item script reached quit/end of scope for new_i: %d\n",new_i);
    itemscriptInitialised[new_i] = 0;
    
    break; //item scripts aren't gonna go again anyway
}
```
That is what would run if the script called `Quit()`
or reached end of scope
note
`item_doscript[new_i] = 0;`
and note the old passive code
```cpp
if ( (item_doscript[q] > 1) || ( (itemsbuf[q].flags&ITEM_FLAG16) && game->item[q] && (get_bit(quest_rules, qr_ITEMSCRIPTSKEEPRUNNING)) ) )
{
    //zprint("ItemScriptEngine() reached a point to call RunScript for item id: %d\n",q);
    ZScriptVersion::RunScript(SCRIPT_ITEM, itemsbuf[q].script, q&0xFFF);
    continue;

}```
which definitely checks `item_doscript`
