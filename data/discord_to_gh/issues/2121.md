When using `outputFile->Create(fileName)` in 107, it will create the needed directories and output file correctly. In all the December Nightlies I have, no directories or output file are created.

This quest has a script that generates a spoiler log for the randomizer.

And these are the scripts used. Create(filename) occurs at lines 3924

(file outputFile is a global variable)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 18:10

and can you just post what the filename would be

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/02/2023 18:10

To access the randomizer and toggle a spoiler log, stand here and press "A"

Files output as `sprintf(fileName, "DragonDuelSeed%s.spoiler", seed_string);`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 18:11

and the seed string would be just numbers and/or letters, I presume?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/02/2023 18:12

(seed string is a series of 10 0 - 9)
(as chars, not ints)

So, I just made a fresh test quest
did file->Craete
and it just fails
so, nothing to do with your quest

`Invalid singledir '.\'`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 18:31

.....and suddenly I can't compile the engine anymore
I am now VERY confused

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 18:46

ok, well, only the parser is failing compile
gonna need to have connor look at that
but

`.\Files\filefoo\Foobar.txt`
.....that's not what that path should read.
`sprintf(qst_files_path,"./Files/%s",str.substr(pos, dotpos-pos).c_str());`
....huh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 18:49

*sigh*
No changes in a year in any of the areas I THOUGHT to check
change 3 months ago in zelda.cpp that affects it

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 01/02/2023 18:50

I wonder if file input is also bugged.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 18:50

it's the directory creation code that's breaking
specifically

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 19:00

ahk, yep.
So, what I had done
is made it stop relying on `win_qst_dir` config
so that it wouldn't glitch out if that config was wrong
.....but the thing checking if a folder name was valid
didn't find `./` as a valid folder name......
so, fixed.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/02/2023 19:42

can we just remove the `valid_*` checks? just defer to the file creation failing if the path is bad.

also wth is the deal with `validate_userfile_extension` why bother checking the extension if you're just gonna allow anything under the sun lol
oh, that's an exclusion list. good.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 19:48

yeah, that's an exclusion list
of executable extensions
grabbed from some web list that had a list of executable extensions

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 20:29

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "can we just remove the `valid…"): also, the validity checks encompass a couple things
importantly, it explicitly disallows `../` pathing
to prevent you from leaving the designated folder

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/02/2023 20:34

that's a good point didnt notice that, but can do that by checking the path is within the cwd.
anything else it does?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2023 20:40

....probably not?
It has to be within `cwd/Files/[quest file name]`
