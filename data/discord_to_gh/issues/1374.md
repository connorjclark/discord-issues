Something weird has been happening to the Zelda Classic game player. When i leave it open for a while and try to go back to it, it's displaying just like this.

Full screen acts bugged.
And it only stops doing this if i close the player and start it back up again.
.
But eventually does this again if i minimize it and do full screen again.

Rainbow death crash.
This has been a bug in ZC for literally *decades*, it's a video driver issue that we can't fix.
