2.55 Alpha 108 Build 61

When the User goes to either the Tile Warp or Side Warp menu (F10/F11) and selects DMap, a drop-down menu comes down. If the User Right-Clicks within that menu, it will close ZQ out without saving.

You replicated easily? I did too. I'm so mad at myself. I finished building 3 screens and went to save, but changed my TileWarp before I saved. It crashed without saving and now I had to build the rooms again LOL.
