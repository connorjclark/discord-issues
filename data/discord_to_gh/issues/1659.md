"block combo" - "block all" flag?

When using a Boomerang or Hookshot to grab a key, if that key crosses a Pitfall Combo, it becomes the deafult wooden sword sprite as it 'falls' into the pit but is still pulled all the way to the player

Guessing that your `Quest->Graphics->Sprites->Misc Sprites` has the falling sprite set to the wooden sword sprite?
Dragged items shouldn't fall though, definitely a bug there

@ InfinityD4 should be fixed
