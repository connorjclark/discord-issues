If you go into the Subscreen editor, then edit any subscreen, __and then immediately click cancel__, it'll ask you if you want to exit despite having made changes.  

No changes were made, though.   At all.  So why is that box popping up?

This is in the unmodified Example255.qst included in the Version 3.0 preview.

yep, intentional
because it would be an absolute FUCKTON of work to track the "have you changed anything about the current subscreen" state

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/02/2024 10:39

...so, to avoid that, the options are `always pop up` or `never pop up`, and given that I lost a TON of work by accidentally cancelling while I was *testing the new editor*, it was clear that a popup warning was absolutely necessary

Ah good.  I'm relieved it's intentional, I guess.  Thanks for the update.  üëç   I like the notion.

the general quest has a global bool `saved`
and any time you change something in the quest, it does `saved = false;`
...I would have needed to make a `subscreen_saved`, and put `subscreen_saved = false` ***in every single possible spot in the subscreen editor***
so yeah, easier to just always pop lol ‚ù§Ô∏è
