I'd like the cross beams to have a flag where the power is a damage multiplier based on the current sword's beam power
Example:
Power: 2 = sword beam damage x2

Like how the spin attack takes the power of the sword and multiplies it based on the "power" slot

might as well do peril beam while we're at it

=== @ Guinevere 10/01/2021 03:55

sure why not
would be cool
and would make peril beams more like a desparation attack than just being able to shoot beams with low life

oh yeah. and also for the peril beams, it would be nice to make an option for the maximum hearts have a flag to switch it to percent of health than a specific amount of hearts so it can scale with how many hearts you have
