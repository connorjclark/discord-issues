Divine Escapes Warp Animation ID 1 seems to be broken in 2.55. The only point of comparison I have is to 2.53, where it worked, I think?

It sends a bunch of pixels upwards, but currently it also sends a bunch to the right as well, which looks kinda weird.

. . .
looks like they are angular instead of directional
because the `angular` variable is uninitialized?
so, pulling random memory?
fun
