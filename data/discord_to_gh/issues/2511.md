Guessing this is smart corners?

=== @ Phosphor 07/09/2023 20:02

Nope, it happens with or without it on
I suspected it as being smart corners too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2023 20:03

Huh

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 20:08

question: did you save after turning off smart corners?
cause I can only reproduce with smart corners on

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 20:20

either way, the problem is that it's snapping you to the combo grid, which is what smartcorners is intended to do... but I question whether or not it could be smarter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 20:26

if you can smarterer it go right ahead
it was my best attempt lol, and it did it's job mostly well
