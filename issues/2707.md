if possible at all.

Right now it's not even quest specific. It's just a visual toggle in the editor. Saving it to a quest file seems a little superfluous to me. Especially since many quests would not use a map's entire space for a negative layer area
Attempting to automate it like how Test Play tries to find the current DMap could perhaps work. But I wonder if that's also too jank? Just spitballing here...

Another cfg file just for that data \:)

=== @ Moosh 10/02/2023 03:21

lol. I mean you could save a string of quest file names and their layer settings to the cfg, then parse it from that. That too sounds turbo jank to me

Moosh, this is what is done for Test init data
So with ease we can have qst specific settings

yeah, the only jank is that it's in the cfg file so the settings won't be there if you send the quest file to someone else for example

I think that's worthwhile jankiness. Most quest development happens on individuals computers, and it's just a qol thing.
