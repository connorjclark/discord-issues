When trying to resize an array of size 1024 to 1024 (enforcing that it's the intended size), it caused the array to go invalid. Size traced to -1. After I added a sanity check it stopped happening, but it should probably have one internally too.
(meta) thread name was changed: ResizeArray() bugged if the array is already the correct size.
