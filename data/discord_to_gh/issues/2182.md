For the first frame or two of a new screen, the health bar in the passive subscreen is not drawn.

This did not happen in 2.53. I bisected to around the time generic scripts were added

First bad:

what kind of script draws it? a global?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2023 06:07

@ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 02/17/2023 06:08

Yeah, global active script. Pre waitdraw

=== @ Moosh 02/17/2023 06:11

Wait nope. Post waitdraw
I assumed because when the scripts were first written I don't believe waitdraw was even a thing, but at some point stuff got moved around

The state of the Quest Rule `qr_FIXSCRIPTSDURINGSCROLLING` in the loaded quest file would be good to know
(should be off for old quests)
aah wait

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:05

hmm, no, that looks probably fine?
OH
*facepalm*

I feel like this should fix it?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/19/2023 05:34

yeeep
so, that clear used to be at the top of that loop
but it got moved to the bottom for generic stuff
....which means its' being called an extra time at the end
This extra time is fine, if the QR is enabled
because, with that QR on, it runs the scripts again that same frame, later in the function; which re-does the draws
(without that, it doesn't clear them, but this means the draws are just carried over from the last frame, which is an old bug... which that QR is the fix for)
