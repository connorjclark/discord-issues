=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 01:27

yeah i can't see that lol
or do i just send a request to join

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 01:51

it's not for you
anyway, looks like the crash is caused by cascading failures caused by loading in corrupted map data

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 01:52

oh
yeah, like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 01:53

it's, like, accessing dmap 50000something

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 01:53

the data is pretty bad

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 01:53

which is very wrong memory

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 01:53

so what's happening in a test screen, for instance

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 01:53

so, uh, something is majorly broken with the map import/export

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 01:53

fwiw there is not meant to be enemies here - this is the same screen lmao

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 01:53

which given that was never upgraded from 2.50.2's jank bullshit, makes sense

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 01:53

oh great

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 01:53

it's complete garbage data

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 01:53

that explains everything

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 01:54

is there a way to merge these two quests for the immediate now? or is that probably a bit of a pipe dream

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 01:56

give me a minute

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 02:01

...huh, actually, this should be working with the new system, so something else is wrong

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 02:05

hah
it just wasn't clearing the temp screen variable in the loading loop
one line fix
and, it's in the loading- so the `.map` files are fine too

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 02:08

lmao fuck was that simple
that's incredible

=== @ mitchfork 02/26/2023 02:09

I'll ask so @ DeletedUser doesn't have to - this is for a 24 hour quest contest him and Sheik are doing. Is there any way to push out a nightly with this fix so that they can finish?

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 02:09

thanks Mitch

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 02:09

yeah one sec

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 02:09

he really wants Mitches Fault 2 out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 02:09

(was already working on it)

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 02:09

I spent an hour having a moment trying to get the importer to work lmao
I'm downstairs destressinf myself by doing dishes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 02:11

will probably be easier for me to just manually give you a build

=== @ tacochopper 02/26/2023 02:11

yeah just DM it to me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/26/2023 02:18
