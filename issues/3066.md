I'm trying to use Poses[] (ZScript_Additions, Line 8995) in a script but when I go to compile it I get this error:

[Error] Final Adventure\Scripts\Subscreens\FinalActiveSubscreen.zs Line 85 @ Columns 35-46 - Error T029: There is no variable Poses[] for the pointer (SubscreenWidget) on the left side of ->.

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> yep that is just missing
needs to be added as a zscript array where the indexes access `widg->pos_up`, `widg->pos_down`, etc

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) this is also an issue
falling asleep as I type, so, cant do tonight... if you wanted to add it it's just what I said above, matching the other similar opcodes for subscreendata

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) this looks like `->PosDirs[]` which is implemented?
`SUBWIDGPOSES`
