In 2.55's current nightly. If you allow for moving while spin attacking, you can spin attack across a screen boundary. This gets Link stuck in the spin attack state, while also creating a phantom sword weapon. Persists until F6 or something else, like getting hit, changes the Link->Action. Crappily cropped video to demonstrate:

Can verify.

=== @ Attempt 12/21/2023 18:43

oh yeahhhhh
this might very well be a compatibility bug
at the same time the phantom sword weapon still persists in a fresh quest, but doesn't lock link's spinning action, that part's been a thing for a while
in another older quest i've seen the locked spinning happen, but didn't report it bcuz i thought it was a quest specific quirk

=== @ Attempt 12/21/2023 18:47

but i guess not

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 03:56

> If you allow for moving while spin attacking

Where is this option?

=== @ Attempt 12/24/2023 04:07

oh, yeah that's worded oddly, what they mean is when you have more than 1 spin, you're able to move around while spinning
usually defaulted for the hurricane spin, but can be applied to the spin attack

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:25

There's a compat QR that causes this - `Scrolling Cancels Charge`. In scrollscr, the spin state is explicitly kept.

https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/74d24c557a74d874d8fa3dc5b50c8e32daff213a/src/zc/hero.cpp#L28375-L28378

This prevents the spin from stopping, and keeps the sword spin weapon alive (but now in the wrong place) until the spin stops.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:27

I see that with new quest - as Genny mentioned that isn't repro'ing the issue russ saw w/ action freezing
What quest was this @ Russ

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:30

_looks closer at the code_

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) this should have braces huh?
i guess based on the name of the qr maybe not?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 04:32

*sigh* that looks like it should have braces

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:32

well lets see what difference that makes if any

umbral cloud is where they ran into it, ralph's adventure is where i ran into it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:34

totally unrelated to the bugs at hand but at least doing as intended now there.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:35

so why is this a QR rule? why keep charge state across screens?
What possible quest is designed to need that?

=== @ Attempt 12/24/2023 04:36

<:LC_Shrug:923342196139249714>
no clue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 04:36

so, the compat rule is for it NOT to charge

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:37

yes, I mean why keep old behavior

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 04:37

because charging used to be canceled when scrolling

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:37

got tripped up in the negations

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 04:37

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "yes, I mean why keep old beha‚Ä¶"): for compat for old quests

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:37

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "What possible quest is design‚Ä¶"): ?
keeping bugs because they existed when the quest was made is not a good enough reason to bake into the engine forever
unless this would break a quest in a meaningful way I want to just delete this code.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 04:38

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "keeping bugs because they exi‚Ä¶"): it wasn't a bug, it was previously intended behavior
afaik

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:39

perhaps the author of the code did it on purpose (ok, clearly they did, as they went out of the way to restore these states), but does that mean quest authors new of it, or even if they did, that they count on it for their quest gameplay/design?

=== @ Attempt 12/24/2023 04:40

then if it's intended, then a whole other bug being how the sword doesn't stay on the player while spinning should also be taken care of

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:40

I thought thats what I was looking at here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:41

it's a bit offscreen here but barely vis on the right edge

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 04:41

no, that's just for charging across screens being allowed or not
should it cancel the charge state when scrolling happens, or remember your current charge
...if it's bugged, that's separate to that compat rule

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:42

my point was that if this code just didnt exist, this weapon would kill itself cuz link isnt ~~charging~~ spining anymore

=== @ Attempt 12/24/2023 04:42

we're talking about the actual spinning

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:42

ah

=== @ Attempt 12/24/2023 04:42

not the charging

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:43

(I meant spinning above - the weapon sprite deletes itself if no longer spinning...)

=== @ Attempt 12/24/2023 04:45

the charging compatibility works fine
the spinning has two separate bugs while scrolling
spinning between screens in old quests causes the bug where they constantly spin nonstop
and how spinning between screens in both old and new quests where the sword jumps to one side of the screen, causing the player to spin with no sword

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:46

it just seems like a terrible complication to even allow spinning when scrolling screens.

=== @ Attempt 12/24/2023 04:46

yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:46

Which is why I want to consider us just clawing it back.
the sword repositioning seems tricky, and then there's all the other bugs still left to diagnose..

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 04:47

ah
...i didn't even notice the *spinning* state there
that uh, makes sense to remove, yeah

=== @ Attempt 12/24/2023 04:47

yeeee i see no benefit in keeping it around compatibility or otherwise, and i think it'd be too much of a mess to make spinning actually work between screens altogether

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:48

Emily, did you think it was just holding the sword/charge and moving, instead of scrolling _while_ spinning?
just making sure I'm on the same page

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 04:48

I'm only half paying attention while I do other stuff lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:49

soooo lets remove `spins = lastspins` and see what happens..
that should keep all the charging bits
yeah that seems better. you still get frozen mid-spin during the scroll (ehh whatever) and launch a beam on the new screen at the end of scroll
but at least you dont keep spinning or have a ghost sword

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/24/2023 04:50

üëç

=== @ Attempt 12/24/2023 04:50

seems legit ü´°

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:51

remove all but `charging = lastcharging;` and that removes the beam too

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 04:59

this fixed it in umbral cloud too!
