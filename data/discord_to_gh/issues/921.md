at Nightmare's request

do we have a zelda text-less version of the 2.10 title screen
who even made it?

=== @ NightmareJames 08/18/2021 23:56

also, the AGN movies have to be eliminated, period
A tribute picture can replace
Unless we get WL's blessing

What about no title screen and you can just start playing games
Or is that too convenient

A start button to skip it immediately would be helpful

Even better @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)
