bahh scratch that i'm dumb
the thread will stay lol

=== @ P-Tux7 07/13/2022 16:31

guys.h was defining a variable, and guys.cpp was defining what it *did* when assigned to an enemy

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/13/2022 16:33

Do you know about declarations, definitions, and compilation units? Might help to read up on how a compiler builds programs individually one file at a time, and then combines the results together in the linker stage, to understand better why things are the way they are in C/Cpp

=== @ P-Tux7 07/13/2022 16:51

Oh I think I'm aware... I just thought it was declaring it *again* in the .cpp file after it had already been done in the header file, which would have been redundant

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 16:52

which variable?
and where?

=== @ P-Tux7 07/13/2022 16:52

the "is lined up" guy variable
nothing is wrong; i just misinterpreted it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 16:52

....there's an `is lined up` variable???
what are you referring to?

you know, ropes/traps
unimportant now
Okay so, can someone please give me a crash course/cheat sheet on what types of number forms ZC code uses? I know about bools, integers, and floats, but apparently there's bittages (i.e. int32) in play here as well.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 16:55

so, that is NOT A VARIABLE
that is a FUNCTION

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 16:55

32bit and 64bit micros have the same types. Let me get you a link, these should all be defined in cstdint

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 16:55

and there is a huge difference
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Okay so, can someone please g…"): `typedef` is a thing

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 16:55

https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cstdint

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 16:55

you can define and name custom types
and ^ that page has the set that we use
realistically, the only ones you care about would be
`int8_t`, `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`, `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, `uint64_t`

=== @ P-Tux7 07/13/2022 16:57

thanks!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 16:57

which are just the number of bits used in the name
and the `u` means `unsigned`
64-bit vars shouldn't be used unless they are *needed* for something
also, you can use the keyword `auto` when assigning something
which will make the compiler figure the type out, for you
i.e.
`auto diff = y-z;`
will be whatever type the compiler calculates `y-z` is

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 16:59

I don't know sqat about zscript but if you need help with C/C++ I can help out

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 17:02

`auto` can be very useful in some circumstances
for instance
```cpp
for(std::vector<int32_t>::iterator it = done.begin(); it != done.end(); it++)
{
    if(*it == ((nmap-1)<<7)+nscr)
        looped = true;
}
```
```cpp
for(auto it = done.begin(); it != done.end(); it++)
{
    if(*it == ((nmap-1)<<7)+nscr)
        looped = true;
}
```
the latter is a LOT easier to type

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 17:03

ranged for loops and functions from `algorithim` are pretty useful as well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 17:03

?

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 17:03

let me show you an example by transforming your loop

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/13/2022 17:04

If you dont give a hoot about the width or size of an integer just use int imo. This is most of the time
Oooh yeah I have clang tidy thing I wanna run to change all iterator type goop to auto

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 17:05

We have tried to specifically have `int` never be anywhere in the code
same with `long`

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 17:05

```c++
std::for_each(std::begin(done), std::end(done), [](int32_t i) noexcept {
  if(i == ((nmap-1)<<7)+nscr) {
        looped = true;
  }
});
```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 17:06

which was specifically so that things would be consistent regardless of 32b/64b builds
(replying to @ C1 "```c++
std::for_each(std::beg…"): ........whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 17:06

I guess if you have to support multiple micros, you gotta use standard int types

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/13/2022 17:06

Well it doesn't matter unless you care about bit representation or overflow somewhere

Which you almost never do in code... Like what c1 just shared

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 17:07

I just made the raw for loop into a `std::for_each`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 17:07

but
why on earth
is that at all better

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 17:07

It does the same thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 17:07

that looks more complicated and worse to me

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 17:07

I guess it depends

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 17:07

like, you're defining a damn function literal in there
instead of just

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 17:08

In my works production code, that stuff is all over the place

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 17:08

putting code in a for loop

=== @ C1 07/13/2022 17:08

ranged for loop is great too
it iterates on objects instead of iterators/indexes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/13/2022 17:09

(replying to @ C1 "```c++
std::for_each(std::beg…"): This could be find_if for early termination

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 17:09

aye, I didn't even notice
that with that you can't just `break` the loop

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/13/2022 17:20

I wonder if compilers reduce it to something sane for simple things like a integer loop

Gonna plug it into godbolt later

=== @ P-Tux7 07/13/2022 17:41

Why are there so many int32_t typedefs in the guy code?

=== @ P-Tux7 07/13/2022 17:43

https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/blob/b3eb6426adfb9b473fd94709c23a19f033b98f61/src/guys.cpp#L98
Like, what is "i" in line 111?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 17:49

`i` is a common shorthand for `iterator` or `index`
usually just meaning `I'm doing a for loop through something`
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Why are there so many int32_t…"): there are NO typedefs in the guy code
a typedef
has the literal word
`typedef`

`int32_t` as a type
is the most common type used in the entire source

=== @ P-Tux7 07/13/2022 18:26

I dunno... even though they're both C++ I'm able to make a lot more sense out of TheXTech's source code
https://github.com/Wohlstand/TheXTech/blob/master/src/npc.cpp
https://github.com/Wohlstand/TheXTech/blob/master/src/npc/npc_update.cpp
Can anyone tell me some obvious way these are set up differently to guys.cpp?
Like, I hadn't even looked at them until less than a week ago and I've already been able to fix a few bugs.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/13/2022 18:40

Nope
because I can't make any sense of those
so
...that second one is just one function
that takes up
the entire fucking file
why
and uh, neither of those have any class information, so
yeah those just look like a jumbled mess of stuff to me
it'd take like a week or two of poking at it trying to do things to even begin to understand it
and I don't know what it's doing
because I know absolutely nothing about SMBX
so
