just as the title said, this panel doesn't scroll when the mouse is near the bottom like the other three and that's an oversight if I've ever seen one.

...scroll when the mouse is near the bottom?
which setting is that?

mouse scroll
the problem is that the forth combo panel does not respect the mouse scroll setting
