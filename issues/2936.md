I'd list them but there's a few; both stuff that's internal to the engine and stuff that isn't returning a value when it should

Try running the "copy_resources" build target
This overwrites files instead of copying over only new assets in the resources
Or are you running from a release downloaded not built local?

std.zh compiles fine downloaded from a release, and locally for me

so uh, @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee), just gonna close this as a you problem?
(gotta actually use the latest std to get no compile errors)
