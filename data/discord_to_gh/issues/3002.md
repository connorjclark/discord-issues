It accesses an array using `get_free_paldata() - 1` as an index, but that function can return 0.

Same for `do_create_paldata`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/21/2024 18:47

Other `get_free_x` don't seem to have this issue.

@ Moosh FYI

think I'm gonna put this off until tonight because it's hurting my head but I looked into it and that -1 apparently was there for a reason. Just wasn't a smart one. Just removing the -1 breaks a couple things ü§¶

Looking at the methods around `get_free_paldata`, all these refs are 1-indexed, so 0 represents a null value.
Just need to handle when the max allocated paldatas have been made.
so the "create new pal data" commands should handle failure to allocate a new one.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/23/2024 00:05

alternatively, you can make script_paldatas a vector and remove any upper bound.

yeah I dunno what was confusing me earlier.
