If I set A button to sword and B button to the hookshot for example, then this is what happens when I press B.

Also, if i swap it so that the sword is on B and the hookshot is on A, then pressing A uses the hookshot as normal and pressing B does nothing at all

uhh
try `Hero->ItemA`/`Hero->ItemB` instead of janky old `SetEquipment`
