Was trying to place some flags on layer 1 of a screen; but the flags ended up being placed on layer 0. Seems to be the case with all layers. @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) would you know anything about this?

that sure is just using the current map and current screen, which entirely ignores layers
`zquest.cpp` in `doflags()`

just gotta swap that to make sure it uses the right layer/screen, which the code for should be at the top of the function

is this right?
