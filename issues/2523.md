This is an odd one and I can't figure out the cause, but I'm fairly sure it's not just me overlooking something. Line 23 where EGTentacle is being created is doing something that's causing the Tentacles array to become invalid. If I comment out the constructor and just pass the null pointer to the array everything works, but when the constructor is being called, the array becomes non functional and I get 
```Invalid pointer (72) passed to array (don't change the values of your array pointers)```
I have two more classes which also have arrays, one of which does so far as I can tell the exact same thing, but only this one is breaking.

Was originally testing on the Z3 build, but tested on the newest nightly too to make sure it wasn't an older bug

(Apologies if this is just a case of tired brain. I usually like to figure out exactly what the cause is. here the furthest I've gotten is "something's fucky")
