Right in the title. I could have sworn it was there before, but now it only shows a cutting sfx slot.

Were you looking in the Generic Combo before?

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 06:45

I don't believe so

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/19/2022 22:48

need a bit more info cause I'm not understanding what you mean
do you mean that Grass and Slash combos don't have a cutting sfx?

=== @ Jared 02/20/2022 03:06

The tall grass has the same walking sfx and slashing sfx

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/20/2022 03:25

tall grass has walking sfx?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 03:29

...ZORIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "tall grass has walking sfx?"): In his mild defense, it really ought to have the capability

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...ZORIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA‚Ä¶"): üò©

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/20/2022 03:42

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "In his mild defense, it reall‚Ä¶"): no but
the combo editor field `Slash SFX`
is what sets it
which is blatantly dumbassed

=== @ P-Tux7 02/20/2022 03:42

wtf
it clearly is not like that in LTTP
walking: "pfft"
slashing: "shr-r-r-ip"

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/20/2022 03:48

Fixed, I think

=== @ Jared 02/20/2022 03:59

Yay
