A way to start with an entirely blanked quest. For Ultimate purists. Everything is blank down to the bone.

You really don't want to... It's an absolute pain in the ass to test it without placeholder sprites or knowing what sound isn't playing/what tile is missing

Let me put it this way; I've been one of the biggest, loudest proponents of non-ripped-asset quests in ZC history, am currently making one, and there is no way in hell I wouldn't at least use the default tileset as structural support.
