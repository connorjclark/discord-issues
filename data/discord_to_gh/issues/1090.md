Something that I panned to add is a vector of npc strings to mapscr. By using a vector it uses space only if people add strings with the caveat tat you must add them starting with npc 0 and canna sip any. Used for friendly npcs that would always spawn, so it should be fine.

Note that some mapscr elements already use vector storage for this reason.
