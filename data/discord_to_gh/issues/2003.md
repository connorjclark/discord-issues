A discussed earlier. After some testing, seems to occur constantly when an eweapon or lweapon leave the screen instead of dying on it (was experimenting with arrows and most die at the edge of the screen, but a few still make it through). When the debugger gives this warning, `Hero->Step` gets stuck at 0, and the npc also stops moving. It doesn't freeze, but soft locks

Was this ever a bug or scripting mistake on my end?

probably a bug
seems like the array literals you were using
in canmove
are not properly deallocating
