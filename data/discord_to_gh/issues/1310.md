I just wondered why `this->Scale = ...` is not working in FFC Scripts

ffcs are not sprite objects
they do not use sprite drawing mechanics such as scale

...oh
I just thought it might be cool for animated cutscenes
Makin things moving closer to "camera"

But I guess I could also create scripted (0 Hitbox) LWeapons, using custom sprites for those kind of sequences

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/25/2021 17:31

Also a great thing to keep in mind
is lweapons of type `LW_SPARKLE` will automatically die when their animation ends once
so if you want to create animations that will run through once, you can spawn that on those and not need to worry about killing it before it loops
