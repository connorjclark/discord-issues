on Linux, but may or may not happen on other platforms

On Expanded view, with unmerged combo columns, the 4th column shifts depending on what's selected in the other columns. Selecting something in the first column has it appear normally, selecting something in the second column shifts everything horizontally left once, selecting something in the third shifts everything twice, and the fourth shifts it three times. This causes actually selecting something in the fourth column to be difficult.

above, something in column 2 selected, causing everything in column 4 to misalign

(replying to @ Entropy "on Linux, but may or may not…"): I just want you to know, this is a wonderful thorough report, and led to me finding the obvious problem in about 2 seconds
So, the array that contains the scroll positions of the 4 columns?

...and here i was thinking "crap, i forgot to write the version"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 21:06

I, uh, never resized it from size 3

=== @ Entropy 03/20/2023 21:06

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/20/2023 21:06

with you saying exactly how which column selected affects it, that's all I needed
turns out the variable after that array is the variable containing the selected column number
so it out-of-bounds'd that

=== @ Entropy 03/20/2023 21:08

:] well, glad it was so easy to fix

...I can't actually test it, because the bug doesn't appear to happen for me in the first place? windows probably handling it differently or something
but, if you can test it once the next Nightly Build gets posted ( #deleted-channel will get a message, probably not going to be tonight )
that would be helpful

=== @ Entropy 03/20/2023 21:09

ah
yeah sure I’ll try to remember

Can confirm the problem is now resolved
i am several days late sorry
