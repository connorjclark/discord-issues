Something to do with the mouse position is fucky with relation to eyeball combos, they should face the mouse in ZQ but they are facing odd directions instead.

k, working in the favorite combo panel which is a5draw, so, should be fixed for things as I a5-ify them

a5 reversion, so no a5 solution. Also, this occurs in non-a5 draws, so, still an issue.
