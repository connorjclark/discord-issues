=== @ P-Tux7 12/14/2021 20:25

So this is an idea where like Oracle of Ages, if you stand on a block destination (name?) and swap with a combo with this attribute, it sets the block destination to be "triggered" and renders the block unpushable if it has a pushable flag on it, just like any other pushblock that is pushed onto a block destination.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 20:58

So, switching pushblock onto block hole isn't triggering it already? ...makes sense...

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:14

Well I wouldn't know, I don't have a switchhook build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:14

oh, duh, I haven't posted that
(hoping A100 comes out soon, just need @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) to finish the last few QRs
pretty sure it wouldn't trigger though
since that's in the pushing code

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:14

But the fact that this was one of my friends' first thoughts when hearing about the switch hook seems to show it's important
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "since that's in the pushing c…"): Yeah I figured

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:15

also, pushblocks on layers still only trigger things on *their layer*
need to fix that

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:15

HOLD it
if you have two blocks and two destinations on different layers
that could mean you could have like, color or symbol coded blocks and destinations
make it a QR at least please

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:16

A block being switch-hooked onto a block hole on the same layer would switch places with each other, not trigger
without doing a lot of work....
blehg
so much to do still

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:18

perhaps a combo type or "Unswappable Block Hole" combo flag that gets checked and sets it to not swap

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:50

@ P-Tux7 hope you're up for some testing
because now:
-Block holes should apply on layer 0 only (+1&2 if the qr for pushblocks on 1&2 is on), UNLESS the new QR is *enabled* to make them do same layer only.
-Switchhooks should not be able to swap with `Push->Wait` combo types if they would not be pushable (i.e. enemies on screen)
-Switchhooks swapping with any push combo should trigger block holes that it swaps pushblocks onto

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:56

sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:56

Anything that is 'breakable' with the switchhook will ignore this, as... the combo breaks, instead of filling the hole
so a pushable `Bush->Next` that you swap into a hole would not trigger the hole

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:56

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "-Switchhooks should not be ab…"): you know
how does this interact with heavy/very heavy pushblock flags

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:57

It doesn't
If you use the `SwitchHook Block` combo type, you can require a certain level of switchhook to switch with it

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:57

whoa

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:57

but other than that, if it's switchable it's switchable

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 21:57

np

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:59

For fucks sake
`cmb2` is apparently a constant in some header somewhere
that's what I get for trying to name my combo variables simply....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:01

@ P-Tux7 here's a full buildpack

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/920411185940152381/920797901117071440/buildpack.zip?ex=65e8e7df&is=65d672df&hm=aa3d18dcbd169674426a8126fd0f59233dae9867a3c417a090b3dd324308dfa4&
Also, push combos that have been 'locked in place' won't be switchable
...which, while it includes block holes, sadly ALSO includes `Push Once` blocks that have been pushed

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 22:02

yeah that's what i'd hope
oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:03

To change that... would mean rewriting how push once's are handled

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 22:03

i dunno if you could swap them off in oracles, but it's not like zc has lttp/gb style "un-pushable" buttons

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:03

yeah
I've scripted such before easily
it was a lens puzzle, so I just used ffcs that were visible to lens only, and checking when a block was below every one of them
but, the whole `click into place` idea means they aren't going to move again
....the question is, should a push once click into place when you swap with it, even if you haven't pushed it?
that would make it `one push OR one swap`, consistently

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:07

oh, wait... hmmm
so, interesting tidbit
if you have a blockhole on a different layer, as it is now, the hole could eat multiple blocks.... because the hole itself isn't being overwritten
that's not right
uhg, and I forgot block *triggers*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:20

OOOKAY
So block holes are fairly easy
Block TRIGGERS are fucking hard

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:22

So, the way I have it set up now
If you layer multiple `Block Hole`s on top of each other
each can eat a block
first the one on the same layer as the block, then counting up 0,1,2
Block Triggers should ALL trigger
and, triggers on layers other than the one the block is on will become that layer's undercombo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:26

....I think that's handled for BLOCKS, now to handle it for SWITCHHOOKS
....frankly I should just make the switchhook run the block placement code....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:43

HOOOOOOOOOOKAY
If you thought pushblocks were jank
now, switchhooking a pushblock
will spawn a movingblock sprite object
and immediately trigger it 'clicking into place', which should *automatically* resolve all triggers the same as though it were pushed
building now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:56

@ P-Tux7 Here, if you could test the everliving shit out of this please

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 22:56

does it come with a quest with the switch hook set up
i know i had to edit the subscreen to get the bug net to show up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 22:57

uhhh

here have my test quest
doesn't have anything set up for pushblocks and stuff
but, it's what I used for the switchhook thus far

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:01

oh by the way
you can shave off a mb or two by deleting the .zips in utilities

try hooking the block after you've hooked it or pushed it

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:10

changed the flag to push 4 way many and same result

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:12

and in this quest (idk about the others) you can hook the block (but not swap) even before you've killed the keese
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/920411185940152381/920815632604340304/switchhook.qst?ex=65e8f862&is=65d68362&hm=71e5b81ba4c7fd7458167f2e48bc3095f344f3b616c5a8d8f62c7632832a8338&
and it seems like swapping a block onto the block trigger doesn't trigger it (i only set up the block trigger in this last one oops), but pushing it does (as normal)
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:13

hmmm
OK, so the hooking but not swapping effect is normal
the switchhook block combo type does the same if it's set to `only swap with combo 0` but you try to swap it with a non-0 combo
that's showing `yes this is switchable, but something's in the way`
apparently it's setting the pushed flag even if it's a many type....

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:15

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "that's showing `yes this is s…"): well it's weird because nothing's in the way

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:15

Something is; the block is already clicked into place

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:15

except for the keese existing, but that SHOULD make it just not hook, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:15

or it's a wait combo

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:15

oh yeah it's a wait combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:16

the wait combo is checked when it tries to actually swap you with the block, not when it initially grabs it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:19

...OH fun
the push flags are dir-based, so I need to set dir shit

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:22

well it would seem everything else is working as planned
though i do have a question - why do bush drops snap to the nearest combo instead of wherever the bush was destroyed? it's not like item drops are required to snap to combos
unlike, uh, combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:27

they... don't?
they drop at Link's position
before the swap

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:30

ohh i must have been doing some close-range swaps sorry

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:32

by the way, a few times i was able to get the switch hook to make the "poof" effect in this quest?
what's the condition for that happening?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:32

oh
there's numbers in the top-left
the top number is the effect style (0=poof,1=flicker,2=rise)
pressing the A button cycles through

=== @ P-Tux7 12/15/2021 23:33

oh thanks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:34

should have a new build in a moment with a couple fixes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 23:38

and a QR for making objects continue their scripts even while they are frozen by the switchhook

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2021 07:55

All sprite objects that are under the switch effect are paused; this includes the switchhook weapon itself, as it also flickers/rises with those effects. Such objects will neither move nor animate, and only will run their scripts if `Switchhooked Objects Run Scripts` is set.

Just make sure it works with blocks,  and on different layers

oh have we tested combos that are larger than 1x1 yet

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/17/2021 03:23

probably not
we'd need some sort of big combo feature
and that... oof

=== @ P-Tux7 12/17/2021 03:25

arent armos and generic combos resizable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/17/2021 03:26

ha ha yeaaaah, that's not any sane handlable system
and also completely Zoria's work

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/17/2021 03:26

the armos system is honestly not very well handled...
it grabs *any* armos combo and tries to position the enemy based on that
makes it impossible to have multiple big armos next to eachother

=== @ P-Tux7 12/17/2021 03:30

we should probably put a disclaimer somewhere that the switch hook doesn't work with resizable combo types, similar to how the diagonal hookshot/switch hook flag says it's experimental
