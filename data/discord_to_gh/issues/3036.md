When you're in the tabs of previewing the player, the animations go super fast, then slow down. It's very bizarre.
You can barely see the animation preview

What version?
Can you show a video?

=== @ Jared 02/14/2024 13:35

I will
It’s been in many old builds including the current
I will update version and take a video for you if it’s still broken
The only thing is that I don’t think it’s always there

I did notice only lifting tab lets you customize the preview speed

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I did notice only lifting tab…"): that's because only the lifting animation has a variable speed
the issue here isn't the speed itself, it's that the *framerate of the dialog is not correct*
either the actual dialog's framerate, or the rate at which the old `DIALOG*` procs the animation updates

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/16/2024 03:14

the dialog uses the "vsync" old gui event for timing
which is based on a high precision clock
I do not see how it could be incorrect.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/16/2024 03:14

Hmm, that was updated to new clock stuff?
Then not sure
That's the only idea I had

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/16/2024 03:15

So I want to see a video, so we can rule out the issue just being like, a two-frame short animation going by too quickly (but thats really what it would look like..)

but jared mentioned it varying in speed so I'm sure there's a real issue
just wanna see it tho

=== @ Jared 02/18/2024 02:26

Let me see if I can get a video

=== @ Jared 02/18/2024 02:28

You can see it at the end

It goes super fast then back to normal
