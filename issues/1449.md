The new compiler hangs ZQ if you attempt to compile again after a failed compile attempt, if you attempt to recompile if the compiler is still up.

....whaaat
I definitely have done this without issue

=== @ Orithan 03/07/2022 22:36

It somehow skipped the phase where the compile error window came up in ZQ

...that uh, shouldn't be possible
can you recreate this or did it just happen the once?
because, if just the once, there isn't much that can be done to debug it
```cpp

bool cancel = code;
if(code)
    InfoDialog("ZScript Parser", buf).show();
else AlertDialog("ZScript Parser", buf,
        [&](bool ret)
        {
            cancel = !ret;
        }, "Continue", "Cancel").show();
```
`if() do_popup_1()`
`else do_popup_2()`
one of the two should pop up
and if there's an error, it should be the `if`

Happened once

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚ùìüîì[CRASH] New compiler hanging ZQ after failed compile attempt.

=== @ Orithan 03/25/2022 00:59

And again it happened
This was in Alpha 104
There might be something short-circuiting the code that is normally supposed to handle this.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/25/2022 01:56

if there's any way to figure out how to reproduce it I can work at it
but if it's just occurring randomly, it could be something like rainbow death crash that isn't fixable

=== @ Orithan 03/30/2022 04:05

I'm doing work on One Screen Gollab in the newest nightly and ZQ is crashing for me every single time on a failed compile now
