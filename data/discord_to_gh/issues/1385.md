I was thinking there needs to be Keyboard Key shortcuts for certain mouse features in 2.55 Alpha, such as -Select Combo needs a Letter Key shortcut, Scroll to combo, Edit Combo and Replace All need single Key Shortcuts.

These choices appear when you Press the right mouse button.
It would make work faster if those commands had keys.
I do alot of Select Combo and Replace all - is why i am looking at this specifically when making ZC games.
it can be very tiring to the fingers is why.*

you can `Alt+Click` to select combo
`Alt+Shift+Click` to select cset

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/15/2022 06:05

What about replace All?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2022 06:05

`Ctrl+Click` to floodfill
not quite replace all, but still useful
Replace all is only in the menu
`Shift+Click` places only cset, not combo

Oh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2022 06:06

`Ctrl+Shift+Click` then, floodfills only cset
but, there are a lot of things and only so many keys

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/15/2022 06:06

Ok

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2022 06:06

right-click menus exist for a reason

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 02/15/2022 06:07

I just use replace all alot
For certain tiles.
