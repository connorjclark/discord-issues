An overhaul of the save file icons system.

Misc Quest Setting Menu: Save File Icons

-Number of Icons (the amount of icons total. this allows writing all icons to the .sav file upon loading the quest instead of having to "stream them in" to the .sav file on the fly as you obtain them.)
-Starting Tile: The tile that will be used for the first icon, and each succeeding icon will be this tile + n - 1.
Icon Progression Itemclass: The itemclass where the highest level of item you own is the "n" above. Set to Armour Rings by default.

I only posted stuff about the icons so that it could be split into more than one task
