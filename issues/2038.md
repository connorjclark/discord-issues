does `#include <stdlib.h>` help in zcmusic.cpp?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/20/2022 20:21

did this recently break? try a bisect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 01:10

I assume this is due to a `-Werror` thing you did recently in cmake?
that's my only guess

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 01:12

the problem appears to be that a macro is re-defind

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/21/2022 01:32

unrelated error type, and that is clang only.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 01:35

Hmm, no clue then. Will look into it more later

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 02:22

Adding this to `zcmusic.cpp` above `#include <aldumb.h>` fixes the issue:
```cpp
#ifdef _DEBUG
#ifdef _malloca
#undef _malloca
#endif
#endif```

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) is this still an issue for you?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/29/2022 09:34

I believe I committed that fix
so would presume no
though that's probably an inarticulate fix for whatever the problem is
I just fucked with it until the error shut up

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/29/2022 15:28

Nope, no longer an issue
On mobile, cant close
