If you pause ZC by clicking on the Window or pressing ESC, navigate to the Game Tab, and choose End Game (F6), nothing seems to happen. Clicking on the console again to bring focus back to ZC finally brings up the screen. Unsure why there is a delay now, pressing F6 does not do this.

> Clicking on the console

What console?
What's the most recent release this bug doesn't happen?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 12/13/2022 21:27

Er, clicking on the ZC Player window.

Going to the F6 option though the menus instantly brought up the Continue / Save / Retry screen as soon as you selected the option in Nightly 12-08-2

Found the issue - @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I reverted `d42c9` which caused this, btw.

...oh
but that brings back the F9 issue then
bleh
I'm done trying to fuck with the render code I suppose. @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) if you can fix the palette glitchiness on F9 or other exits then, that would be good
because it's only fixed during the `Saving...` prompt, not on an actual exit

Yea, can you make a bug thread and assign me for later
this behavior is worse so i just reverted without looking more into it, while i do other things
