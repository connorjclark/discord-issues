Unless there's a jank way to achieve this with combo cycling or some way with the new trigger system I'm missing, it'd be great to be able to essentially light arrows on fire if they happen to pass through a torch combo. It'd allow for slightly more creative torch and light puzzles.

"Ignite Weapon"
Added this like a couple weeks ago, fresh feature

Ahh, I'm blind since I saw the first checkbox but somehow ignored the others. It would be nice though if it could swap out the sprite of a projectile for a burning variant
At least the puzzle mechanic works though

=== @ Phosphor 06/03/2023 23:02

No idea if it's possible for a projectile to be easily hot swapped for another

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/03/2023 23:03

That's not so easy to add in engine, but could be scripted easily- and scripts can read if a combo has ignited a weapon.

=== @ P-Tux7 06/03/2023 23:23

Could a basic fire overlay be added to such projectiles?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/03/2023 23:23

Not easily in engine, no
Directions and different weapon sprites and bleh
It would be easier to change the sprite, which is not easy

=== @ P-Tux7 06/03/2023 23:29

oh true about the directions
though as for overlays i was just imagining them as 4 misc sprites that apply to all weapons depending on fire strength
certainly no "per-combo" or "per-weapon" combinatorial explosion

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/03/2023 23:30

yeah, that doesn't work, because like
arrows and brangs would not line up
different arrow sprites might not even line up depending on the quest
