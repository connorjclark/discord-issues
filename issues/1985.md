It's always seemed strange to me that the bottom 8 pixels of the screen weren't viewable in Z1. It's even stranger that this arbitrary limitation's been maintained in ZC when so many other NES quirks have been fixed. In my experience, it frequently gets in the way of puzzle elements along the bottom of the screen, say nothing of the eight pixels of real estate that can't be used for menus and the like. Is there any compelling reason not to add a QR to expand the screen size 8 pixels to actually make use of the full screen size?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/26/2022 22:09

nope.
The reason is everything is hardcoded jankery around the screen size.
I'm not touching that with a 50-foot pole.

=== @ Russ 10/26/2022 22:10

how hardcoded are we talking here?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/26/2022 22:10

painful

I'm pretty sure some ancient version of ZC didn't even have the limit at the bottom. Could be misremembering though.

this affects how eweapons/lweapons and enemies interact with the bottom screen border

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2022 19:44

...it *does*? Huh?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2022 19:44

oh and where link starts scrolling downwards/is blocked at if its at the bottom of the map
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...it *does*? Huh?"): err i mean all of those things are coded to assume the current bottom border position

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2022 19:46

....they are?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2022 19:46

like the y-value where sword beams, rocks, and arrows pop/die

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2022 19:46

I didn't think that was coded to account for the damn 8 pixels
and, well
unless you have evidence otherwise, I'd frankly not believe you
because I'm damn sure everything I've seen has been using `176` in engine for the bottom border

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2022 19:47

the POINT is it seems unchangeable
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "because I'm damn sure everyth…"): yeah like that
(i was addressing it to russ, btw)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2022 19:47

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "the POINT is it seems unchang…"): but you're saying that using facts that are.... just wrong?
not the best way to make a point
nothing afaik accounts for the bottom border aside from *draws*
and like, things like the bottom row of combos? those don't specially account for it or anything, they just hit the edge
...It doesn't seem changable, but not for ANY of the reasons you gave
more, just the general it being a pain in the ass
....which is why I specified that *I* was not touching it, and left the report open
rather than saying "This isn't possible" and closing it as denied

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2022 19:51

i'm sorry but what i had seen from observation, playing hundreds of quests, seemed to support the idea that the visible top and bottom borders of the screen are the "physical" boundaries for game objects' despawning/pathfinding too

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2022 19:52

I was wrong. Sorry.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2022 19:52

aye, not trying to be aggressive or anything, just correcting
You said it with such confidence that my brain just went `Wait, it WHAT NOW? Since when?`
