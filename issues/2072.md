=== @ Blaze0168 12/07/2022 16:25

Version used: 2.55 Nightly 2022-11-30
Seed Number 69-69 in 1st map with story mode on
The boss is located on the upper left side of the map. Stumbled upon him at the beginning, where it crashed once. Got there later to try again, where ZC always crashes when the boss uses the attack where he stands in the top-middle of the screen.

=== @ Russ 12/07/2022 17:12

Okay, question. Several attacks he does draw arcs of light radiating out from him. Do any of these work? Or does it crash before he‚Äôs able to use any of those attacks?

=== @ Blaze0168 12/07/2022 17:27

So far, any attack works, as long as he does not teleport to the top-middle. As it crashes before an attack comes out, I don't even know which attack that would be. Let me quickly check which other attacks he does depending on my RNG luck

=== @ Blaze0168 12/07/2022 17:32

Just now, I got him to half life and he teleported to the middle, then it crashed. So this time, not on the upper part of the arena. Maybe that would have send out arcs of light from him. So far, I only saw the following attacks:
1. Teleport, then shoots 3 light projectiles in a cone
2. Spawn two jumping balls
3. Teleport, then shoot beam of light

=== @ Russ 12/07/2022 17:50

Okay, that confirms it. It‚Äôs any attack that draws an arc that causes the crash

=== @ Russ 12/07/2022 18:20

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I don‚Äôt suppose anything has changed with arc draws?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/07/2022 19:45

Lots of changes in the 8 days since the last nightly. No idea if any relevant, but I kicked off a new build just now.

=== @ Blaze0168 12/14/2022 00:51

I have been testing it with the last couple of nightly releases, resulting in a crash every time so far. (not yet tested with the latest, but so far, no change so far. Didn't want to test too much around) Would I need to do anything apart from taking the new nightly and just paste it into the folder with the old release and save file? Or any other recommended way to either update or transfer save files from release to release?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/14/2022 00:52

To do a full test, it would be best to extract the nightly you are testing to a new folder
and then copy just the quest file
(you probably should be starting a new save in every build)

=== @ Blaze0168 12/14/2022 00:54

Okay, will try it out next time I get to do it. At least, my save is a fresh one anyway as this happened in my first run üòÖ

=== @ Blaze0168 12/16/2022 21:55

Alright, I tested it on nightly-2022-12-16 with a new file and still got the crash. At least, the seed is perfect to get to the boss right away as he is accessible from the beginning

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 21:57

ü§¢ this is one of the worst pieces of code in the source
arc is cursed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:04

looks like no way for the bitmap to have been destroyed, so likely the x,y values passed to floodfill need a bounds check

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:05

There is a known issue with that though- simply bounding the floodfill x,y within the region can sometimes place the floodfill OUTSIDE the arc, rather than INSIDE the arc

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:05

no not that `_soft_floodfill` checks the bounds...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 22:07

That's as far as looking at the code will get me. Best to get it crashing locally and see whats up

=== @ Russ 12/16/2022 22:46

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "ü§¢ this is one of the worst pi‚Ä¶"): It's just as bad on the user side

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:47

Arc is awful

=== @ Russ 12/16/2022 22:47

```//This code is awful. I completely blame Arcs using counter-clockwise angle calculations instead of ZC's standard clockwise angles```
```//Seriously, what are you doing reading this? There's plenty of other terrible things out there to read. Like Ayn Rand or the Old Testament.```
```//I'm as shocked as you are that this attack actually works as intended```
Some comments from Evan on the script in question that's crashing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:47

....it fucking uses counter-clockwise instead of clockwise? What??

=== @ Russ 12/16/2022 22:47

YUP
This function is absolutely abysmal

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:48

It's terrible right down to the allegro level

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/04/2023 06:16

What dmap, scr can I use on test mode to debug this crash?

=== @ Russ 01/04/2023 11:41

Dmap 28, screen 51 oughta work

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/08/2023 10:20

in flood.c

I'm not sure I understand but maybe it'll help?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/08/2023 10:23

noticing that it happens in a check for linear bitmaps

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/08/2023 18:49

Like something is corrupting memory. Gotta run with ASAN on.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:04

*bump*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:19

trying something on a whim
was able to reproduce the crash

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/21/2023 23:24

See those first few lines in the CMakeList?
uncomment those for ASAN
and try your repro running in VS
You'll need to disable sound, though (there is some problem there that will trigger ASAN)
Do with either RelWithDebInfo or Debug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:26

k my random attempt at fixing it did nothing as expected
time to try that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:34

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) uhhh

oh, I can't run it and attach I have to actually run through MSVC?
bleh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:37

err, so what do I need to do?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/21/2023 23:41

Right click the Zelda target, Debug.
set -s command line or otherwise disable sound
It should pause whenever memory is improperly accessed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:42

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "It should pause whenever memo‚Ä¶"): well uh

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1050085756330311730/1077737164160385104/image.png?ex=65e7adf3&is=65d538f3&hm=a6c69ca75ad5c7dafbd9ae0c44516338c472e635bfbda540168905f77a9dd471&)
exact same break it gave without ASAN enabled

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/21/2023 23:43

Also should have paused when improperly written...hmm

It's a plugin you also need installed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:43

ah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:44

...I have it installed already.

or am I reading this wrong
might be, cause I'm stoned
no, I'm not, it says install is 0B in size with that checked
though MSVC has an update available apparently, let me run that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:54

Here, btw, if you want to crack at it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:55

(replying to @ Russ "Dmap 28, screen 51 oughta work"): Set cheat to 4 and go here, enable invincibility, and uncap, it'll crash when the boss chooses the arc attack
test mode does not work on yuurand due to heavy scripting
that save has the whole main menu shit done, and has cheat 4 entered and saved, so you don't need to enter the code, just select cheat level 4.

=== @ Russ 02/21/2023 23:59

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "test mode does not work on yu‚Ä¶"): I was idly wondering how this would work the other day. Guessing either garbage player sprites or Rhone and subscreen doesn't open/items don't spawn and don't work when cheated in?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/21/2023 23:59

subscreen was totally broken
didn't bother poking at it once I noticed that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/22/2023 00:07

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "though MSVC has an update ava‚Ä¶"): No change, still just breaks on that exception. I have no further ideas here. @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) hopefully you can solve this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/22/2023 03:22

Betting $100,000 it works on 32 bit.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/22/2023 03:30

=== @ Blaze0168 02/22/2023 15:01

I can confirm that I can see a new attack, which I never saw before. Thanks for all the help üôÇ

=== @ Blaze0168 02/22/2023 16:50

nvm, seems like some change since the last time I played the last nightly. The latest nightly does not seem to have the mentioned fix yet, I assume üòÖ

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/22/2023 17:11

no, it would not
it will be up in A112... which can be expected any minute
