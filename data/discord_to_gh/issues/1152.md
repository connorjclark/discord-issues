Older versions of Armageddon Quest are broken because they have a bunch of invincible ghinis with a lanmola as the kill all enemy

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 18:52

Yeah I was gonna report this but needed to make some comparison videos. I'll do it later

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/06/2021 21:11

okay this seems pretty simple
lanmolas just handle their deaths differently

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 22:28

i wonder, should we test this on all the other multi-enemy enemies?
moldorm, manhandla, patra, and... gleeok?
(as for batrobes/summoners i know those work as ringleaders, at least in 2.50.2)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/07/2021 14:04

Lanmolas have never been ringleaders
In theory the income value might help here
But ringleaders tended to be Z1 quests and lqnmolas have never been such
This coupled with the lanmola death bug rule makes them somewhat unsuitable

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/07/2021 15:08

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "Lanmolas have never been ring…"): demonstrably false.
You can literally open up 2.10 and test this.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/07/2021 15:09

Either way, this was because lanmolas got a bit of a rewrite in 2.50, presumably to make them less buggy with the enemy editor

=== @ P-Tux7 11/07/2021 15:14

one quest already used them for that purpose - armageddon quest

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/07/2021 15:40

Oh? As did that?
Well, you can apply it to the core enemy.
And the .10 src exists to use as a point of comparison.

we seem to already know how to handle this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/08/2021 00:54

Okay I'm actually tearing my hair out
I have the source code for both 2.55 and 1.92 open
I'm trying to understand just what exactly changed to disallow lanmolas to be ringleaders

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/08/2021 00:57

the thing where it's stopped is that "dying" is never set as true for the main enemy, it handles it's own death on it's own

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/08/2021 01:11

1.92 also checks for dying, and the only time dying is set is if hp <= 0

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/08/2021 15:55

Okay, figured it out, and it's absurdly dumb
In old versions, the handler enemy set it's own id to something else in the initializer

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/08/2021 15:56

So when the check to grab the first enemy of that id and assign it the ringleader value happens, it would grab the first segment of the lanmola

(meta) thread name was changed: 💊🔓Lanmolas dont count as ringleaders
