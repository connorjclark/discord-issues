Idk if this is already possible in engine (without like dummy screens, or a maze of identical combos to set up, or other jank) but I was thinking about having a boss/normal lock block, or screen secret state require multiple states (dmap and/or global, including combinations of the two) being triggered to itself activate.

The only specific use case I have right now is the poe flames gimmick. You murder a poe, it triggers a secret in its room, and then when all 4 are defeated, a secret triggers in the final room. 

(TotK spoiler:
||Every Temple/dungeon has you activate 4 or 5 switches to open the boss door and the order you reach them in can vary||) 

The way I imagine this could work is having a checkbox that un-grays a text field where you specify what level state numbers, comma separated, are needed. 

The main benefit to this is being able to activate the triggers in any order, making design less railroad-y. As well as cutting down on combo bloat. Most importantly, to cut down on reliance of scripting (however minimally.)

You can do this with crystal switch states and trigger groups

Oh trigger groups, yeah that sounds like it'll do it. I'll have to fiddle around with the trigger stuff then

(have each state affect an invisible combo on the boss screen, and those invisible combos use trigger groups)
(or visible, to show progress)
||just like the visible latches/etc in totk||
