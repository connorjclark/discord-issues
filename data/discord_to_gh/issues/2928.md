Since we got a warp back feature,  I think this would would help make it easier to have the ability to set the return warp automatically especially using Passageways in NES dungeons.

Knowing "what links here" is a hell of a lot more work than knowing what screen you were on when you last clicked "follow warp", for the record
also, how would it handle multiple things linking there?
...or, would you just want to be able to quickly set the warp to whatever the warpback currently points to?
That won't necessarily be a thing that points to that screen, is the thing; if I follow a warp, then spend an hour doing other stuff all around the quest without following any other warps, for that entire hour the 'warp back' will still point to the same place
