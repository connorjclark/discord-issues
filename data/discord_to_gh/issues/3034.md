When attempting to leave a dark room screen with torches that combo cycle between each other, as soon as I hit the edge of the screen, ZC crashes.  It does not crash if the screen is not a dark room with these combos present.

Wonder if caused by recent combo cycle fix (edit: nope)

@ Joaish can you upload a qst file please?

=== @ Joaish 02/04/2024 12:49

Is it ok if I DM the file?  I don’t want this qst to be public yet
