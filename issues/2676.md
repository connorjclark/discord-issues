>when I need my quest to be free of errors but ZScript's internals are producing them too

oh also this function isn't documented correctly. it has rotation arguments apparently

Okay I think I've fixed this one, but it's got a bit of history I feel the need to share.

```void DiceFace(int layer, int x, int y, int p1, int p2, int p3, int p4, int tile, int cx, int cy, int cz, int cset){
    if(DiceCenterZ(p1, p2, p3, p4, cz)>=0){
        int pos[13];
        
        pos[0] = x+cx[p1];
        pos[1] = y+cy[p1];
        pos[2] = cy[p1];
        
        pos[3] = x+cx[p2];
        pos[4] = y+cy[p2];
        pos[5] = cy[p2];
        
        pos[6] = x+cx[p3];
        pos[7] = y+cy[p3];
        pos[8] = cy[p3];
        
        pos[9] = x+cx[p4];
        pos[10] = y+cy[p4];
        pos[11] = cy[p4];
        
        int uv[9] = {0,0,  0,32,  32,32,  32,0};
        int csets[5] = {cset, cset, cset, cset};
        int size[3] = {2, 2};
        
        Screen->Quad3D(layer, pos, uv, csets, size, 0, tile, PT_MASKTEXTURE);
    }        
}```
So here's a function using Quad3D from Forbidden Ascent. You might notice contrary to the docs, the arrays are sized 13, 9, 5, and 3 rather than the numbers listed in the docs. I ran into this bug during that quest's development and assumed the docs were incorrect, sizing them accordingly so it would go away...So turns out the docs were not in fact incorrect

The function `ArrayH::getValues()` would return an error any time it hit the last index for the size specified if the array was exactly as long as that size. And every function using this either took size as an arguments or used  hardcodes. Up until the batch drawing functions which would just always hit that error.

So I just swapped the order of the conditions in this for loop, it should see it's reached the end of the array and quit 
```for(word i = offset; BC::checkUserArrayIndex(i, sz) == _NoError && num_values != 0; i++)```

I think this shouldn't cause any compat issues because it was just returning an error erroneously, not actually accessing the array an extra time. But just making note of it because I found it mildly amusing
Also spotted problems with a couple of  the other batch drawing functions in the process. I don't think these things were ever tested
