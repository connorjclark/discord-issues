Requesting some way to include a file relative to the quest file from ZScript. For use in tilesets and collaborative quest organization. Deedee expressed interest so I'm making this as a record of the idea:

^ This needs to, if added, be a checkbox in the compiler settings dialog- a quest-specific setting would make sense (which makes it actually use a QR behind the scenes.... I hate that more and more every time I think about it)

the compiler/script settings thing needs to go

?

just make it part of Options and have those buttons just open up those tabs in the options

it has a button literally right there when you go to compile
which is when they matter
(`Docs` launches the `ZScript_Docs.html` using your default program for opening htmls, and `std_zh` opens the `include/std_zh` folder in your file explorer, for the record)

Quest script settings specifically

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/23/2023 14:54

that's not compiler settings
quest script settings, fair.
(The qr search searches both, though)
(actually with a checkbox for whether to include the script ones or not)
(so, really, qr search is the better way to use those)
compiler settings is perfectly fine where it is
