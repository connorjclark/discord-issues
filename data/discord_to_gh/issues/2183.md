Latest Nightly, Feb. 16.  In Compact Mode, with 1 combo column, Scroll to Combo will mess up the combo table offset.  This is what's adusted when you use Shift+Arrow Keys

It seems like this also happens at 2 columns in Expanded mode.
At 2 columns (Compact) or 4 columns (Expanded only) this does not happen

already fixed in a branch
(The damn column height is an odd number of combos, and it uses a `/2` in the scroll to calculation, and *didn't snap it to multiple of 4*, because it never *needed* to before)
....but, I fixed this in the middle of changes involving removing small mode
so, this fix is waiting on merging that branch

You'll note quite a few things in this image being missing from latest nightly. All of those are in that branch.
