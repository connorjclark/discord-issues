In the title. I noticed now there's text boxes for both in ZL, but I feel like premade options would be nice as well.

bleh
can you just use the Video Mode menu in ZC/ZQ?

=== @ Jared 06/18/2023 23:34

Oh, yes! I didn't know that existed
It works fine, but I guess I was just thinking for the future
Cause I could have sworn they USED to be premade

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/18/2023 23:44

They were, because you could only use those premade values and nothing else
it was changed when proper scaling was added
(also, it was only premade for ZC, zq had no options)

Ahhh okay
