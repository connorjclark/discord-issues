Attribute: Step Speed

Flag: Re-Use Boomerang To Summon It Back (that is, if a boomerang exists on-screen, you have the boomerang currently on a button, and press that button, the boomerang currently on-screen will return back). Useful for if you miss your target with a Magic/Fire Boomerang, and can be used for trigger/crystal switch puzzles.

The fuck? I thought I sent a message. How do you create a thread without a message?
So anyways...

Flag: Re-Use Boomerang To Recall It
(If you have the Boomerang currently equipped to a button, re-using the Boomerang will recall it as though it had hit something. Does nothing if Boomerang is already returning. Useful if you miss your target with the Magic/Fire Boomerangs, and also comes in handy for trigger/crystal switch puzzles.)
