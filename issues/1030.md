I would formally like to ask about adding more fonts to the string editor and I personally happen to have a huge collection of fonts from various games, including Castlevania 3 - Dracula's Curse, Chrono Trigger and a few others. Here's the DL File for my personal font collection: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VQ0wm05uV8EQVqXrzeklGwviaUHQUZSF/view?usp=sharing
@<role: Developer> Heads up!

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 17:09

reminder that all fonts must be reduced to one colour

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 17:09

don't need to ping all the devs

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 17:09

(for lttp, zc outlines the text using code in a string setting)

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/18/2021 17:10

aye, my apologies.

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/04/2021 22:48

@ DeletedUser I vaguely recall you showing off screenshots of a build that had more fonts and I'm pinging you because I still kinda want the actual Castlevania 3 font in ZC
Please reply to this thread when you can.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 00:20

oh yeah where's the allegro font tool
nvm i'm dumb

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:05

@ FireSeraphimIwasgoingto add a `userfonts.dat`with twenty slots into which anyone could make a file and use those fonts via a module

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/05/2021 07:06

mind if I paged @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:06

I suppose that once 
I install vc2019 I coud add that. It is not that difficult
(replying to @ FireSeraphim "mind if I paged <@!2424224362…"): I do not  mind,but even if I did it isn't my server so as  long as it is permitted do as you wish.

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/05/2021 07:07

aye

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:07

It's about one total day of work to add this feature.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:09

I may just bake it into fonts.dat as ten user fonts and be done

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:10

I do however think that a custom userfonts is best with a command to load it n ZScript so that you can hot swap fonts adhoc.
this would allow a lot of freedom but it needs a lot  of GUI shyte in ZQE to support it

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:14

as it is not up to me now I do not have say on if this is going to be included if I make it and I want assurance that it will, ere I waste time creating it
I short I will not even begin on such a task unless the concept is preapproved.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:14

The question I have is, how much would it add to embed a few custom fonts in the .qst?
like how SFX are loaded?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:15

how much what?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:15

would that add too much bloat to the quest file?
if not, I feel like that would be a far better system

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:15

Fonts are bitmap images
you'd store tem externally
but if you do tat tewn ZQ cannot preview te messages

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:16

Why couldn't they be stored internally though?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:16

hence why I thought that a ten font userfonts.dat was the best solution

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:16

just write the contents of the bitmap to the quest file, `pfwrite()`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:16

I suppose they could
but that has the same problem
https://www.allegro.cc/manual/4/api/fonts/load_font
if you have a better idea there is the documentaton

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:17

I mean, it can `write_bitmap()` to a tempfile and then load the tempfile
if the load_font requires it be a file

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:17

that only supports GRX
IDK if the fonted output would wor

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:18

`or any bitmap format that can be loaded by load_bitmap()`
if you read the full sentence

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:18

and again, there is the string editor and te subscreen to cnsider

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:18

`a GRX format .fnt file, a 8x8 or 8x16 BIOS format .fnt file, a datafile or any bitmap format that can be loaded by load_bitmap().`
For string editor/subscreen, the user fonts would just be appended to the dropdown lists

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:18

Sure
I do not ind this
but it reuires team effort
not e alone sitting and doing it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:19

aye, certainly

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:19

and the complications of working with an eternal repo pus the new vs version mean it won't happen fast
coding this is not that hard
for the basic font loading
I'd do it in ZScript first
then you can add the other crud
incuding the file sel dialogue to add a font
it will need a somewhat complex dialogue including storing a font name and a pulldown for the slot (1 to 10)
and will further deprecate Tango to a point

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:22

well, it'd be kinda like the `SFX` dialog

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:22

so that is a bonus

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:22

you select a slot to edit, then name it and load a file

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:22

sure
I just want a team effort to add that jank

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 07:22

should be fairly simple, though I'll want to build it in the new system, so won't just be pure copy+paste on the sfx one

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:23

Adding a major feature like this is not something I a wiling to do solo
I am more than happy to do the skeleton implementation at some point and let you do all of the GUI crud

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:25

I still need to do the basic ffscript stuff fr rgbdata and palette
so I need to reserve registers and ASM opcodes for my use
first
twenty to thirty
I don't want to resolve erge conflicts on an external repo and futz about

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/05/2021 07:27

in general when anything artificially pads a task to increase the amount of required time I just say no.
so reserving these allows me to avoid merge conficts
and thus not waste time

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 15:24

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "would that add too much bloat…"): i can't imagine so
allegro fonts are 1-bit images
i'm sure one page of 8-bit tiles would take the same amount of room as 10 or even 20 allegro fonts

=== @ P-Tux7 10/05/2021 15:26

and it should add almost zero bloat if the user does not ADD any, just like sfx and 8-bit tiles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/05/2021 15:27

aye, fair

=== @ FireSeraphim 07/22/2022 09:45

Bump

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/22/2022 09:47
