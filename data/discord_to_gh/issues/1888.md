Old report: #1871
Combo insert offsets need to be handled in `zq_tiles.cpp` for `Combo Pools` and `Liftable` properties.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 23:39

Turns out it's not just the [i] and [Shift]+[i] that undo the offset.  I just did a Copy -> Move to these combos and they also didn't copy over the liftable properties.
... odd.  Now I can't repeat that.  Eh.
I mean my bush combos are all messed up in terms of lift data and they weren't before I did a giant move, but if I now try to move them to blank combos they retain the lift data.

More testing is needed.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 23:44

err, move would absolutely do it
because what `i` is doing
is just `move`'ing every combo after that spot
those are all the same one function

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 23:45

Rightright.  I'm just a bit befuddled because if I try it with one or two combos, it suddenly _doesn't_ offset anything.
But I'll defer to your code determination here.  I'm just going to play around with it on my end to see what's what.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 23:46

Are you `move`'ing the combo that has liftable properties?
Only the combos that are moved would change

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 23:46

Yep.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 23:46

err, sorry
rather
only moving *the combo that is selected* would change
so

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 23:47

I even moved the liftable bush combo and its undercombo in one fell swoop two combos over, and suddenly they kept their liftable properties.  At least the one that had any did.
Two combos next to each other moved, I mean.  Two spaces to the right.

moving the combo that HAS the liftables configured
would not break anything
Moving the combo that is set as the lift undercombo or other combo gfx, WOULD break

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 23:48

Mm, gotcha.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 23:48

because, basically what the problem is
is it's just copying the combo
to a new spot

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/21/2022 23:48

<tries it>
Can confirm what you're saying.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 23:48

....but it *doesn't change the combo ID that is set in the lift properties*
so it would still point to the old number
because, it needs a special check to know to update itself on all combos where it appears as a liftable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 23:52

oh, this should be really easy
I thought I had to add a new whole loop here
but duh, combo cycling already has to be here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/21/2022 23:54

...pools require a whole new loop
ah, but
I was thinking of tiles when I was thinking how hard adding new loops was
apparently combos are easier

new bitty loop and a couple new things in the loop above

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2022 00:00

building now, hopefully you can give it a test shortly

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/22/2022 00:01

I'll see if I can stay up for a bit, sure.  I'd love to.  Thanks! ‚ù§Ô∏è

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2022 00:01

hopefully my PC doesn't explode in the meantime

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/22/2022 00:01

I've definitely been looking forward to this fix the most.  Selfish of me, but it's a really really big improvement to ZC and the users' experience.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2022 00:01

(Every time windows updates, it like, crashes my display driver or something, meaning I get absolutely no video from the PC, and need to hold the power button to force-reboot it)
(and, now, it's happened a couple times NOT related to windows updates, too!)
(fucking beautiful....)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/22/2022 00:02

Fun.  Sorry to hear.  How're the temps?  Always good to be on top of those.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2022 00:02

my room is the arctic
and my pc has like 3 fans

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/22/2022 00:02

Envy.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2022 00:03

but
my pc also
has a >10 yr old graphics card
which is far to expensive to get a new one of

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/22/2022 00:03

Luckily video card prices are dropping dramatically.  I'd contribute a few hundred for one.

(only ZQ should really be new, but, good to package-deal them)
(mostly because like, saving in that ZQ, would make an old ZC yell at you that your quest was 'saved in a newer version')

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/22/2022 00:07

Works like a charm with Moving.
Aaaand [i] works too.
You're fantastic.  üëç
Get me that paypal, dawg.

On it.  Grr, phone needs a  text to confirm and it's all the way across the room.

That'll do.  Thanks again!
It's not a coffee, but maybe it can process a coffee.

To illustrate my sleep habits, you sent that message at 8:16 PM Eastern.  I was probably offline and asleep at 8:14 PM.  

Terraria is my favorite commercial game.  They released in 2011 for $10, and have been releasing **free** huge content updates every few years for another eleven years since then, never charging a dime.  They've since skyrocketed to the 9th best game in the world, and have earned the coveted "Labor of Love" award on Steam.  I would buy that game ten times over for the amount of hours I've gotten out of it, with over four thousand to date.

Emily, you are currently the prime developer of a game that has given me over twenty years of brilliant amusement and a creative outlet unmatched by any other.  I've never even purchased ZC and I've gotten more hours out of it than Terraria.

How could I not support such a noble effort somehow.
Thank you for the bug-fixes, the amazing features that grant even more hours, and have widened my face with unlimited smiles! <a:cheers:828087164604252190>

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2022 09:26

(replying to @ Employees Must Wash Hans "To illustrate my sleep habits‚Ä¶"): I'm in your timezone. To illustrate MY sleep habits, I'm still up.
Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/22/2022 09:26

Wild.  Certainly! ‚ù§Ô∏è <:hugheart:1012188325790089317>
Use it in good health.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/24/2022 09:03

This might not be fixed.  I had just remade this particular Combo pool (My most used one at this point.) and then everything slid down again after I got last night's build and was already offset again after I immediately slid in some combos near the top.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1021391932905234432/1023157675372056646/unknown.png?ex=65ec25d7&is=65d9b0d7&hm=75affb876979063a5a1a5979645758c40ffe9309a2bf3a378636a569af6dd0c1&)
That top row shouldn't be garbage.
I'll keep y'all updated.
Yep, the bug's back.  Just tried it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2022 09:04

wtf
OH
for FUCKS
SAKE
I forgot a single `&`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2022 09:07

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>
so what it was doing
without that `&`
is making a copy of every combo pool
correcting that copy
....and then the copy stops existing because it goes out of scope.
Yay.
(With the `&` it doesn't copy, it references the original)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 09/24/2022 09:08

A mighty symbol indeed.
