Similar issue to this mentioned in the CPU usage bug. It only very slightly noticeable. But I can tell it's playing at a slower tempo than a107.

Compare the default piano melodies on Zquest.

I can sort of verify this at well, The midi music on my end is like 5% to 10% slower
somewhat subtle but noticeable at the same time
