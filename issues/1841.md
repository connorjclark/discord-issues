HitXOffset doesn't seem to change the x position of the enemy's hitbox.
HitYOffset does work normally though

AHHH
i think i figured it out
it doesn't work for wizzrobe type enemies
walking enemies work fine
*also found out that negative makes it go left, my bad, haven't looked at a graph with x and y in a bit*

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 02:13

yeah, negative x is left, negative y is up

=== @ Attempt 09/07/2022 02:13

ye
got my stuff backwards
but yeah wizzrobes hitxoffset don't work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/07/2022 02:16

interesting
