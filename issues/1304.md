Bitmap draws have to be drawn to the same layer they are being blitted to in order to be drawn to said bitmap.
After talking with Emily this is a definite bug and needs to be fixed.

Can you replicate this in a fresh quest with a minimum-sized script?

Test quest
Script is in the buffer
Press L to change layer which the circle is being drawn to

So, in this example
you're blitting to the bitmap on layer 1
and then  blitting from the bitmap on layer 0
doesn't show that draw
because it hasn't happened yet
...I see no bug with what this test quest showcases @ Orithan, this seems completely correct
If I change it to blit the bitmap on layer 1
it displays, regardless of whether the circle draw is layer 0 or 1
which is correct

if there is a bug, this test quest fails to showcase it.

(meta) thread name was changed: ❓Bitmap draws need to be same layer as what bitmap is blitted to

=== @ Orithan 12/25/2021 22:21

I was able to reproduce this bug in the test quest file

...Could it have something to do with the build I have? I'm running on the test build that fixed the overhead layer combo issue
