So anyone can keep up with latest ZC development updates without having ether multiple ZC folders, or issues caused by overwriting ZC internal files.

The easiest way to do this
is to keep all of YOUR files outside the ZC folder
so like, make `ZC Stuff` as a folder
and in that folder, have `ZC` which is the ZC folder
and `Quests`, `Scripts`, etc as separate folders
outside the ZC folder
then you don't need to ever touch any of your files when updating
the only thing you would need to do is update your controls (unless you copy your old config, which is *usually* ok, though can very occasionally cause issues)
and copy your save file, if you care to keep it
