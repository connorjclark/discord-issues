Yesterday I proposed this entire redesign for the save/file menu mostly to improve the save the save/file menu and help Zquest Classic move away from the Z1 Menu (because continuing to have that menu could get in the way of the dev team's endeavors regarding the de-copyright infringing of ZC). I made this mockup with an eye towards ZC's known rendering limitations. I first showed a slightly earlier mockup yesterday and we had a discussion leading to this revised mockup. 
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) would you be so kind as to summarizes the previous talking points?
