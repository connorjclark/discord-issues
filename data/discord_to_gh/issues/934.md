This could have several behaviors that are seen in official Zelda games.

For starters:

Shooting through it with an arrow could give it fire properties

As well, if a torch combo is on screen it could make a screen count as "lighted" in the context of dark rooms. This could be helpful for a variety of reasons, such as if people don't want the candle itself to provide light, if they want temporary light from lit torches or if they want a screen where you have to light torches to permanently light it up.

Nooope, not touching this until rewrite.

=== @ P-Tux7 08/22/2021 18:50

didn't you make them for mm2d
also lit torches are extremely screwy in zc as-is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2021 18:50

that's a script
this is feature requests channel, so, for engine

=== @ P-Tux7 08/22/2021 18:51

oh well

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2021 18:51

also, it's a bad script

=== @ P-Tux7 08/22/2021 18:51

so the issue with lightable torches would be that every combo animation timer runs on the same cycle
so let's say you light up one torch
the next torch you light up would either extend the animation of the first torch, should the combo be set to restart animation upon being cycled to
or it would extinguish when the first torch extinguishes, if the combo is NOT set to do that
you'd have to make each unlit and lit torch a separate combo

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2021 18:53

^not necessarily
you could make a bunch of combos, each of which lasts for 1 frame before cycling to the next
then they'd effectively run on their own timers

=== @ P-Tux7 08/22/2021 18:54

neat also that's viscerally disgusting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/22/2021 18:54

yep
but yeah, this should wait for full rewrite
I think in the rewrite we'll probably have real fucking darkness
like, with circles of light, ala lttp
because having that in engine would be nice

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) did you do something with arrows through torches, or was that just an idea?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/02/2022 04:56

It's the next major feature I was planning to touch
I've just been focusing on bugfixes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/02/2022 05:00

(meta) thread name was changed: arrows through torch combo effect
this thread is horrendously outdated lol
was just digging through archived reqs

=== @ P-Tux7 02/02/2022 14:55

so animated arrows are part of the 4 way weapon fix right
