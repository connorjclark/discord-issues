Layers do not appear to be drawing correctly in the latest nightly. They seem to be drawing the contents of Layer 0 to that layer.

In the latter case the layered stuff on Layer 1 is causing the contents of Layer 0 to be drawn above the player because said Layer 1 Combos are overhead combos

=== @ Orithan 12/20/2021 03:07

In the former case Layer -2 is drawing above Layer 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/20/2021 03:59

Oh fuck wait, overhead combos are involved?
Thank god, something sane to deal with

I'm THAT stupid, huh?

I think this is irrelevant because you said this was fixed for the next build in another channel, but I am still running into this problem here.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 05:38

Oh?
#deleted-channel still in this build?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/21/2021 05:49

I know I fixed overhead combos being a problem

=== @ Orithan 12/21/2021 06:17

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "#deleted-channel still i‚Ä¶"): Yes. I don't see a new build in #deleted-channel after the one you linked me to

That one is newer than the download in this thread

=== @ Orithan 12/21/2021 08:04

It still has the problem

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:31

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Orithan https:‚Ä¶"): Tried this. It still has the problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2021 04:39

so what exactly is happening wrong?

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:42

The bug I reported
Layer -2 is rendering over Layer 0, Layer 2 is background on all screens in the first screenshot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2021 04:44

dmap flag layer 2 is background, screen flag layer 2 is background, or both?

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:44

Both

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2021 04:44

They are a toggle
both being enabled disables it

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:45

...
I think it would be clearer if it was listed as a toggle on the screen data end
It didn't used to be a toggle

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/22/2021 04:47

It was *supposed* to be a toggle
but zoria doesn't know how to do shit right

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:48

Oh
Its still listed as Layer -2 in screen data

=== @ Orithan 12/22/2021 04:49

There now it's working
ZC still has oddities with viewing Layer 2 as background even with the appropriate setting is checked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 02:57

What oddities?

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 03:02

Namely the preview for other screens does not use the Layer 2 as background property when the view option "View Layer 2 as background" is checked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 03:03

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) ?
(For the record, the view as bg option also is toggled by the screen flag)
(...or, should be, at least)

=== @ Orithan 12/23/2021 03:05

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "(For the record, the view as‚Ä¶"): The screen flag toggles it fine and it works with adjacent screens that also have the flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 03:09

So adjacent screens just ignore the view option?
Pretty sure @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) could probably fix that easily enough
