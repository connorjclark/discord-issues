It would be nice if there was a keyboard key which could advance your currently selected combo +/- 1 combo in the combo page, since sometimes related combos are laid out in series and it would be a lot easier to just press a key to advance to them than go back and forth between the combos with the mouse. I suggest the `[` and `]` keys for this, since I think those aren't already occupied by a shortcut, but I'm not very picky about which keys could be used for this.
