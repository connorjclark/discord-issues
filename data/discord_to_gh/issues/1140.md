Apparently, the "Start with 999 rupees" quest rule was misinterpreted when updated for newer quests in 1.90. Apparently, it's a quest rule intended to start you with the level 2 wallet. However, this seems to have been forward ported as starting with actually 999 rupees. The intended behavior should be starting with a *max* of 999 rupees, not starting with 999 rupees.

=== @ tim 10/28/2021 04:49

looks like i also misunderstood that one
i was under impression of amount and not wallet back then, but never used the rule

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 04:59

really easy fix, might be able to fix this right now

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 05:07

ah yeah that was before 1.92 init data

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 18:35

(meta) thread name was changed: 1.90 compat bugs
This ended up being a bundle cause there were way more than just that issue for 1.90
spawning graphics didn't initialize as wSPAWN, because 1.90 stuff is handled in it's own if statent

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 18:37

message strings were broken by being 1 too short both width and heightwise, a bug I fixed a while back for everything but 1.90 quests cause, again, those are handled in their own if statement

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 18:38

subscreen couldn't even be opened, because, again, subscr speed initialized as 0 instead of 1 when only the 1.90 if statement runs
(I'm surprised it lets you unpause though. I would have expected a softlock)\

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2021 18:39

Fun

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 18:41

1.90 quests are going on the watchlist for "might have broken stuff"
So uh, tha tmeans I'm gonna be binging 1.90 quests in the near future... fun.

=== @ tim 10/28/2021 18:55

ping me for anything 1.90/1.92 related
can verify and test old versions

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 18:57

newfirst edit, type "zelda" cheat, give yourself bow and arrow, speed to first dungeon

ok so it seems like arrows are meant to go that far inside dungeons inside 1.90, i know at least one quest that takes advantage of this that doesn't work right in 2.50
https://www.zeldaclassic.com/resource-listing/entry/83/

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 18:59

(i don't know of any quests that use the left/right thing but i did it just to test; it seems like it doesn't work unless you stand right next to the wall so the arrow spawns "inside" it for a frame)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 19:01

(tested it out on the overworld as well, it seems like arrows go all the way up even in 2.50 so we're good there)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 19:02

none of the dungeon arrow triggers in these locations work in 2.50.2

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 19:11

i think keese tribbles also grow up into vire tribbles in 1.90 quests
when they SHOULD grow up into blue vires
and lanmolas/manhandlas need per-segment drops enabled in 1.90 quests

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 19:13

i can't remember if it applies to any extant 1.90 quests but the "old hammer range" thing should apply to 1.90 quests if it wasn't already

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 21:51

Okay uh this might be harder to recreate than I thought
because we don't seem to have the 1.90 source code

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/28/2021 21:52

^ aye

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 21:54

it looks like it's blocking them some of the time but not all of the time
so I assume it's pixel and step speed based, where it clips farther before getting blocked

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 22:06

@ P-Tux7 it would be helpful to know the specifics of when this change was introduced. Currently it checks for quests made before 1.92.
The arrow clip, I mean

=== @ tim 10/28/2021 22:13

i wanna say 2.10 was the big version where it changed

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 22:13

that's odd because 1.92 and 2.10 seem very similar

=== @ tim 10/28/2021 22:14

i think i tested this with ptux in 1.92
do you recall?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 22:14

i don't sorry

=== @ tim 10/28/2021 22:15

problem is 2.10 doesnt run in w10 or dosbox
it might run in wxp vm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 22:18

apparently you need command line arguments to run it

=== @ tim 10/28/2021 22:21

i could try later tonight to force it to work

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 22:21

dumb question can the 2.5 launcher launch THAT .exe

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 22:21

the guy who told me this is currently away, I'm not sure if they're offline or not

=== @ tim 10/28/2021 22:21

i found this arrow issue in uh

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 22:22

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "ok so it seems like arrows ar…"): ^
that's the quest, a 1.90 one

=== @ tim 10/28/2021 22:22

this is the one i reported back then
altadd

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 22:45

@ P-Tux7 what version was that quest saved in?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/28/2021 22:48

nevermind, seems to have been saved in 1.90
okay, hmm

=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 23:00

yeah both ALTADD and my test quest are saved in 1.90
top video is 1.90 player
bottom video is 1.90 QUEST in 2.50.2 player

Seems to be a good guide for running in older versions
I'll keep this handy
@ P-Tux7 could you do me a favor and see if this persists in 1.92?
we have the source for that, and I'm really hoping it wasn't fixed before then

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 02:55

yeah i'll try
which version do you have the source for?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 03:27

1.92 b114

=== @ tim 10/29/2021 03:27

that's the thread i pulled the dosbox config from
rambles also reposted it at some point

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 03:40

Disregard that, I figured out what line of code broke this behavior
So the old behavior can now be recreated 100%
And it clearly does exist in 1.92 b114
I need to check when exactly it got added though

=== @ tim 10/29/2021 03:41

i must've tested it in 1.90 and not 1.92 then

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 03:42

er, I mean
The old behavior exists in 1.92
As in it wasn't fixed by then

=== @ tim 10/29/2021 03:42

OH i misread

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 03:42

And it doesn't exist in the initial version of 2.10 (just checked)

=== @ tim 10/29/2021 03:42

so my thoughts may be right
i can do a quick test in b183

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 03:45

Okay, out of curiosity
2.10.3 was the final release of 2.10 right
before 2.11 dev started

=== @ tim 10/29/2021 03:46

that im not sure about... let me see what i have

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 03:46

there's a dark period between 2.10.3 and 2.11 beta 11 where this change got added
we don't have any source code between those two versions

=== @ tim 10/29/2021 03:47

my copy of 2.10 is from 1/1/2005
let me see if i can open it

=== @ tim 10/29/2021 03:52

all i seem to have is that date which is build 0
you have a copy of 2.10.3?
can you check the file date

=== @ tim 10/29/2021 03:57

and hell if its newer than what i have i'll take a copy and see of i can run it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 04:02

It seems like 2.10.3 was just a ZQuest update looking at this

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 04:07

Also it's only the source code
I don't think I can build it
(can't find a date for 2.10.3 or 2.10.2 in the source files... figures)
but 2.10.2 seems to be the latest 2.10 build

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/29/2021 05:10

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i think keese tribbles also g…"): as far as I can tell, the source code already has code for this
Does anyone here have an example of a 1.90 quest with tribble enemies so I can test this out?

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 17:43


https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903143138741350410/903700503517610044/TRIBBLES.QST?ex=65eb4e2d&is=65d8d92d&hm=6e57a4b2d65e3998b7526640a3fe13894d4490e84bafdedd35755947e79c1312&
so go to cheats, type "zelda" and cheat yourself the White Sword and then wait for the tribbles to grow up
if the keese tribble grows up into a blue vire, GOOD. if it grows up into a black vire, BAD
and now test the zol you see by hitting it with the white sword. if it dies in one hit, GOOD, it's a regular zol. if it doesn't, it's a zol tribble, which is BAD
so in summary tribbles in 1.90 quests are supposed to grow up into their ORDINARY versions not tribble versions
also sorry, gels and zols look identical to their tribbles in 1.90 (both use the same tiles and cset 9), nothing i could do to expedite that

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 03:06

Was half-tile weapons hitting you supposed to be off in this version and 1.84? @ DeletedUser
And perhaps 1.92 as well

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 03:30

I'll work on this tomorrow.  I spent a lot of time on ZC tonight.  I need to do some other things

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 10:40

I can't remember if we agreed to have it flaggable or not
I'd prefer to have it togglable via emulation flags for 2.50 and below to avoid issues TBH
And let rules take care of it from 2.50 plus

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 12:48

That's the plan
I'm asking if it's currently in ZC or not
Or if all pre-2.5 quests are broken

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 12:51

I'll put it on my list to review.  RN taking care of 1.  5th Quest Whistle addition and 2.  Next recording, in addition to IRL stuff. Probably deal with it next week or on my next major time off.  🙂

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 13:10

no problem, i've got this

=== @ P-Tux7 11/04/2021 08:06

oh, something else i need to check in 1.90 (and possibly 1.92/2.10) is lanmola spawning
in quite a few quests i've seen they can't move at where they spawn, implying that they used to spawn in psuedorandom locations like other dungeon enemies
come to think of it i should check blue wizzrobe spawn patterns in those versions too...

=== @ tim 11/04/2021 17:24

is it mostly screen edges?
ive def seen stationary in the middle of the screen though... not sure what causes it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/04/2021 17:28

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "in quite a few quests i've se…"): Is it Hookshot 1 you're thinking of?
Cause I know it's an injoke there

=== @ P-Tux7 11/04/2021 17:50

no i mean 1.90-2.10 quests lol
(replying to @ tim "ive def seen stationary in th…"): more like middle to the left
i think that's where they always spawn in z1 (you know like how gleeoks always spawn in one place), and someone fixed it from 1.90 to 2.50, but failed to make the old behaviour still apply to 1.90 quests in 2.50

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 00:37

invisible enemies in 1.90 were completely invisible a la zelda 2. not cloaked.
i need to test if this applies to their projectiles
i'm not sure if the amulet was in 1.84 because 1.84 was 1.90 with half the inventory missing but let's make the version check "1.90 or below" just in case

=== @ P-Tux7 12/24/2021 03:39

ok so according to haylee apparently swimming in 1.90 (and 1.92? idk) had something a la smart screen scrolling but ONLY when swimming
also in 2.50.2 it seems that the whole "bomb explosions last longer and can kill aquamentus with one bomb" isn't enabled in 1.90 (and 1.92? again idk) quests automatically?

=== @ tim 12/24/2021 03:51

why would it
that's not how it was intended in 1.90/92

=== @ P-Tux7 12/24/2021 03:54

i admit it's not high priority but quests should generally play the same as the version they were made in
and also because iirc there's already a quest rule for it so it's not a big deal to toggle it being turned on automatically in said quests

=== @ P-Tux7 01/23/2022 00:06

ok so the aquamentus thing is somehow a 1.92 only thing. it takes two bombs to kill an aquamentus in 1.90 and the compat rule name is correct.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 09:41

This channel is kinda useless now that compatibility reports are a thing

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/08/2022 09:43

@ P-Tux7 if it's not too much trouble, could you recap the specific issues that you don't think are fixed yet? Either here or in compat rules, either works
I just need to sort out what's a bug that needs to be fixed and what's an observation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 13:20

(meta) thread name was changed: 🔓1.90 compat bugs

=== @ P-Tux7 02/08/2022 18:15

yeah i am
i've already made a few channels and have been in the process of testing a few more
turns out that lanmolas and manhandlas do NOT have per-segment drops in 1.90 - that was a bug introduced in 1.92, just like the aquamentus 1-hit bomb kill

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:49

check if lanmola spawn location is hardcoded in 1.90 and check if "entering screen on a water combo + ladder causes softlock" bug from 2.50.2 is still extant in Puzzle Quest
