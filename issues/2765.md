I have some trouble distinguishing the valid screens from looking at this.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I personally disagree
though being able to configure which 2 colors it uses would be nice

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/20/2023 03:05

Maybe misalligned is the wrong word, but the pattern does differ in a way that makes it hard to read. I'm not sure any checkboard would be easy to read for me here.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/20/2023 03:07

You can't truly disagree that it's hard on _my_ eyes.
As it is, this doesn't feel like a good default.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/20/2023 03:11

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it's far easier on my eyes than either of the other options

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/20/2023 03:13

Yeah static is garbage, and I get the x not being loved. But can't we just do Black?

=== @ Majora 10/20/2023 04:45

personally I vouch for solid black. checkerboard on slightly different checkerboard is cursed. our monkey brains were not meant to perceive this much artificiality

=== @ Moosh 10/20/2023 05:19

wow I just changed one of the checkerboard offsets (tile editor) because of a request I remembered from a couple people. Should've kept a more careful eye out so I could've spotted this one too ü§¶

=== @ Moosh 10/20/2023 05:21

I think the off centerness of the pattern is helpful here because of the possibility of a fully gray map square but more odd to me is those black lines around the edges which might be a bug

=== @ Moosh 10/20/2023 05:22

Oddly I wonder if the "bug" is the solution here though. Give the map squares a black dropshadow while in checkerboard mode so they stand out more?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/20/2023 05:30

Looks like I introduced that off-by-one with my recent minimap refactor.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/20/2023 05:36

The checkboard is drawn to an a4 bitmap, and the rest is drawn with a a5 bitmap. Since the minimap bitmap is now just the size bitmap and _moved_ to the right position, I think the pixels happen to not align just so for w.e. reason. Fix is to draw the background checkboard on the a5 bitmap instead.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/20/2023 06:54

the a5 part of the minimap is handled here now btw: `src/zq/render_minimap.cpp`
