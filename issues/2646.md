I am running into a new and bizarre bug where the game basically freezes a few seconds after you load a save file.

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2023 17:24

Admittedly so far this is only happening on my own quest, I am testing it now with other quests to try and narrow down what the problem is

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2023 17:43

I can fully confirm it only happens on my quest, after much testing

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2023 17:46

I strongly suspect it's something to do with my main loop setup in my quest's master script

close this, I can fully confirm it was the setup of the main loop in my master script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 19:13

do you have `Jit` enabled in the launcher?
Do you have `Jit Precompile` enabled in the launcher?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2023 19:39

no

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 19:41

your main loop itself looks fine

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2023 19:41

also please check line 300 of the master script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 19:41

but, you didn't post any of those functions
so I can't see inside them

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2023 19:41

the main loop

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 19:41

```cpp
//UpdateGhostZH1();
//SlipperyIce::doIcePhysics();
//LinkMovement_Update1();         
//Waitdraw();
//UpdateGhostZH2();
//LinkMovement_Update2();
BombsScreenShake();
updateAttackDefenseCtrs();
//Waitframe();
```
...really only 2 functions I don't recognize
can you post the code of `BombsScreenShake()` and `updateAttackDefenseCtrs()`?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2023 19:42

The second one is from a script you wrote for me recently

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 19:42

which script

one that hijacks a couple of custom counters to display Link's Attack and Defense stats in the subscreen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 19:44

*sigh* so, question time. If you comment out `updateAttackDefenseCtrs()`, does it stop freezing?

=== @ FireSeraphim 09/06/2023 19:44

yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 19:44

fuck me
It's calling the new `CurrentItemID()` function
and that's the only thing in it that looks suspicious

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2023 22:04

`ri->d[rEXP1] = current_item_id(ity,checkcost,checkjinx,checkbunny) * 10000;`
checkbunny fn being converted to a boolean
`clang(-Wpointer-bool-conversion)` yeah that's gonna become an error.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/06/2023 22:05

I can't account for this being why a script would freeze, though.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/06/2023 22:06

hopefully that's the cause
and it's just... doing something weird
