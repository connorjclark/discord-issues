So I have two examples, the first does not work but the latter does
```class foo{
    int damage;
    int spr;
    int sfx;
    int spr2;
    int sfx2;
    
    foo(int damage, int spr, int sfx, int spr2, int sfx2){
        this->damage = damage;
        this->spr = spr;
        this->sfx = sfx;
        this->spr2 = spr2;
        this->sfx2 = sfx2;
    }
}```
Working one:
```class foo{
    int damage;
    int spr;
    int sfx;
    int spr2;
    int sfx2;
    
    foo(int _damage, int _spr, int _sfx, int _spr2, int _sfx2){
        damage = _damage;
        spr = _spr;
        sfx = _sfx;
        spr2 = _spr2;
        sfx2 = _sfx2;
    }
}```

And here's a hybrid of the two that makes me think the this-> pointer's responsible. This one also doesn't work:
```class foo{
    int damage;
    int spr;
    int sfx;
    int spr2;
    int sfx2;
    
    foo(int _damage, int _spr, int _sfx, int _spr2, int _sfx2){
        this->damage = _damage;
        this->spr = _spr;
        this->sfx = _sfx;
        this->spr2 = _spr2;
        this->sfx2 = _sfx2;
    }
}```

Fixed @ Moosh @ Deathrider
issue with `this->` and assignment
