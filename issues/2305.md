Alpha 113, in prior versions the mouse would hide itself when unpaused and on the ZC window. Now it's always visible and blocking the view of ZC.

Interestingly, moosh had feature-requested being ABLE to make it do this via script
#2163
probably worth adding that while fixing this
Notably, most of the mouse code was ENTIRELY rewritten to not use AL bullshit
so this is not a specific tiny issue, this is just "oops, something was rewritten wrong"

Fixed, pushing. Still working on the feature request mentioned above.
