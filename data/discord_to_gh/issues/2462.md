Not sure if this is possible, but is there any way we could scroll through `Select Palette` and see the changes on the screen as we scroll through the list? I feel like this would be SUPER helpful in picking a palette instead of clicking okay and looking every time.

(tagged as open, unassigned- so, the standard 'on the list' tags)

Yes please
Doing work for Phosphor's tileset and this would make it easier to tell if various combos look right in various palettes

Hotkeys: "Next Palette", "Previous Palete".

=== @ Phosphor 06/21/2023 22:33

Can't you just do ctrl and + or -?
You can rapidly check through palettes with that
Well actually it jumps forward by 10 palettes whenever inputted
shift and + or - jumps foward or back a palette one at a time

I've tried everything you've said, @ Alucard648  and @ Phosphor  but none of them worked. I'm in the latest version.

(replying to @ Jared "I've tried everything you've…"): Strange? I'm doing it here in the May 31st nightly

(replying to @ Jared "I've tried everything you've…"): 1. Hotkeys are configurable
2. There's a ZQ option to disable all palette hotkeys to prevent accidentally changing them (which exists because it was widely requested)

=== @ Jared 06/23/2023 00:28

I don't think you're understanding what I'm asking.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/23/2023 00:29

No, they were talking about something else

=== @ Jared 06/23/2023 00:29

I'm asking if we can change palettes in the drop-down as we pick but NOT hit the okay button
Oh okay

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/23/2023 00:29

I'm aware of what you requested

=== @ Jared 06/23/2023 00:29

That wasn't meant to be rude or anything btw.
That came off way wrong lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/23/2023 00:29

They were just suggesting an alternative that already exists

=== @ Jared 06/23/2023 00:30

Oh okay. Yeah that was good for like 10 palettes but nowadays we have a lot more than that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/23/2023 00:30

(i.e. doing it not in the F4 menu to preview it)

=== @ Alucard648 06/23/2023 21:52

Numbers also don`t work as of NB 2023-6-15

=== @ Alucard648 06/24/2023 15:34

Thanks. Now it works.

. . . . I went to look at how difficult this would be, and
it was DEAD DEAD EASY.
