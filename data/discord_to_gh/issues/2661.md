So a question for all questmakers: Do you ever use the Favorite Aliases list? I am planning to remove this feature and merge it with the regular favorite combos list, thus reducing the need to frequently tab between drawing modes. This would in turn reduce the number of slots for favorite aliases and other special drawing types down to the same 140 used for combos. Would anybody be significantly impacted by this change?

I don't even think people typically have thousands, if not just hundreds of Aliases to need a Favorite Alias list.
