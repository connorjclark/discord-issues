The big bug here is that either scrolling or warping will cause ZC to freeze for a second, and then instantly crash-to-desktop on arrival on the next screen.
------

I'll open by saying I made two additional test quests after experiencing this bug.  The second one only has two screens and two warps, which I can scroll to and warp between freely without an issue.  That was just to see if it was actual scrolling or warping that was the issue.  That test quest was made with standard NES Fixes quest fules set at first.

I also made another quest file that does the same, but with the enhanced SNES rules.  No crashes.
-------
So, this quest that crashed had me delving into the following:

1)  Opened by selecting the Enhanced SNES Rules.  Then,  I made three Dmaps.  #0 is Overworld.  #1 is a cave / Interior.  So is #3, but that has the "Wavy water effect" Dmap flag enabled because I wanted to test Sideview Swimming there.

2)  Three new Midis were added and assigned to the Dmaps.

3)  I got curious and went into the Enemy Editor and modified Enemy #123,  "NPC 1 (Standing)" and give it Goriya graphics, gave it an arrow weapon, and set its Damage and W-Damage to negative ninety in the hopes that it could heal the player. I placed that enemy as enemy #1 on the screen and put Flag #37 down somewhere.  It never spawned on-screen in-game.

4) One screen east of the upper-left corner (Where we start the quest.) I also got curious and wanted to put a Moblin, but found an enemy named "Moblin" which ended up being a Guy. So I put it in the list, but found that it was showing up as "<None>" rather than "Moblin."  In fact, all Guys show up as <None> rather than their name-sakes.  I tried to leave them in, but walking onto that screen just initiated the freeze and crash.

5) I erased those enemies because I thought they were causing the crash, and created a cave on Dmap 1 and put down some dive warps, Switch, and Switch Block combos in there along with a level-key for a lockblock in a chest combo and some enemies.

I think that's about it.  It's not a very interesting test quest.

^ There's the quest file.  Godspeed, y'all.  Password should be blank.
Here's the other files that it made though, just in case.

Windows 10 64-bit, 21H1.   Launched from ZCL.
I didn't even get to test sideview swimming, or any swimming.  It just crashes when it scrolls or warps.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/08/2021 22:45

It's not the Overworld Midi.  I changed it to the standard Z1 Overworld and it still crashed when scrolling East.
I'll try deleting the screen to the east and remaking it and see what happens.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/08/2021 22:46

**YES**.   Deleting the screen to the east and remaking it with __only__ combos and nothing else avoided the crash.
But warping into the cave on the first screen did still crash it.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/08/2021 22:48

Here's the test quest where it no longer crashes if you scroll to the east, but still crashes if you go into the cave on the start screen.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) - I was asked to tag you.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 09:28

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) this is a you issue
sprite.cpp line 1856
``spr_spawn_anim_frm=(spr_spawn_anim_clk/wpnsbuf[spr_spawn].speed);`` it's a divide by 0 issue with speed
easy fix

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 09:36

The issue was with enemy's spawn animation
If you had a speed set to 0, it would crash
fixed now
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíHard Crash in 2.55 Alpha 98, the first Sideview swimming one, when scrolling or warping.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/09/2021 12:56

Neat, thanks.  I'll test it again on next release.

My concern is that the crash occurred even after I removed those NPC enemies from the screens that had them.  Even entering a cave that only had Keese and Moblins crashed after warping from a screen that had an NPC on it at one point, but was then erased from the enemies list of that screen.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/09/2021 22:49

I encountered a Hard Crash again.  This time, I was actually able to enter the cave on the starting screen without it crashing.

The crash occurred when I killed the blue Moblin in the first screen of the cave.  I haven't made any modifications to this test quest since I uploaded it.  This is the test quest with the deleted and remade screen to the east that didn't crash.

I did cheat myself a L1 sword.
L4 cheat is 4.  No password on the quest.
This is using the revised build Emily posted today.

more of the same issue

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/09/2021 22:58

<pat-pat>    

Thanks for looking at it.  üòï

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/09/2021 22:58

it crashed when you killed something
because it's the death poof
that's crashing
dimi fixed an instance of the spawn poof crashing
but not the death poof
and not even all the instances of the spawn poof
building a full fix now
(this is why you make sure you don't divide by 0!)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/09/2021 22:59

I try and avoid that mistake in all walks of life, yes.  Wise words.

<downloads>
That was quick.  Thakns.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/09/2021 23:02

Yep, no crash.   Remind me, did the original NES TLOZ have no death poofs?   Not being sarcastic; I genuinely don't remember.  >..<
Because I don't have any.   At least it didn't crash.

you need to set the frames/speed on this
it used to be hardcoded
(or you can enable the rule `Compat->Hardcoded Shadow/Spawn/Death anim frames` for the old behavior)

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 10/09/2021 23:49

Yep, worked fine.  Thanks.  <:NPCNurseThumbsUp:573570441697034281>
set the frame data to 2 frames, 4 speed.  Didn't crash.
