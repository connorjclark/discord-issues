Two things:
- Basically, a hurt sprite for Link (like in ALttP for example)
- Non-hardcoded (assuming they are), selectable/editable colors for when Link flashes when hurt (an use for this would be for GB Zelda tilesets to allow for GB zelda-accurate hurt colors for Link without needing like 3 csets just for that)

How long would the "Hurt" sprite be on the screen for?  Because the player can walk _immediately_ after being hurt, so I'm wondering if that "hurt" sprite would also need to be animated so they can walk while being hurt.
I'm imagining a player that looks like they'd just been knocked back, but while they're in that state, they're also moving around because someone's using the keyboard to move, and it looks like the character is just kinda hovering around on the ground for 3/4 of a second while not moving their body to do so.

i was thinking during the knockback.

so that'd be pretty short
probably not something for the engine this version
but easy enough to script if you wanted to?

there also are kinds of harm that don't cause knockback - i think if a fireball hits you at the right angle you don't get knocked back
