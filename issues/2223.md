I did a search, and only saw this thread (https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1081411843387576452/1081411843387576452) which is not quite the same issue I'm having.

I'm using Alpha 112, so my bad if this has been fixed, but it seems like the solidly set here is ignored. I did a test where the entire liquid combo is not solid, and Link moves to the same position.

Test quest is included, it's map 1, screen 0C, should open right to it by default.
