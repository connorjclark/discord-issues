In LTTP, Link's sword creatse sparkles (basically LW_SPARKLE) which move up the tip of Link's sword while charging / sit in front of the tip when charged, and then his spin attack also creates sparkles around the sword. 

Some approximation of this, creation LW_SPARKLES on the LW_SWORD during LA_CHARGING and LA_SPINNING, would be a neat option in-engine (though it's not that hard to do with scripts, so low priority).

^ More priority to this, because it resolves a major issue of 8-bit sword sprites not being able to display charge progress

In LTTP, Link's sword creates sparkles which move up the tip as he charges, then appear near the front of the tip when charged, and then continues to make sparkles around the sword during the spin attack.

Something similar could be achieved by creating LW_SPARKLEs on the LA_SWORD during LA_CHARGING and then during LA_SPINNING, which would be neat. (Although this can be mostly handled by scripts, scripts have no way of telling how far along the charge progress is so you can't really do the move-forward-on-the-blade effect). Alternatively you could wait for the sparkles to appear at all until charging is done.

would use an item flag to enable, and a `Sprites[]` sprite for the sparkle

Ah, whatever works
it is worth noting the position of the sparkles shifts a bit. The ones on the tip seem to move from side to side a bit.

^ Review LTTP before implementation
