It looks like when a counter being displayed in the passive subscreen changes (possibly only if it changes via DCounter), animated items drawn in the passive subscreen either pause or reset their animation.
Present from the original 117 Alpha to current Nightly.

*sigh* yeah that would happen wouldn't it

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/08/2023 17:50

It shouldn't mess with the animation clocks? What if... the tiles the items use are written to by CopyTile at some point prior?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2023 17:50

....why would that matter?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/08/2023 17:51

It sounded like the animation shouldn't be resetting... which it is.

@ HeroOfFireZC does this fix?

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "It sounded like the animation…"): no, like, it shouldn't, as in I should change that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2023 17:53

...I mean, CopyTile wouldn't affect... anything

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/08/2023 17:54

Thanks, that looks so much better now. I was just misunderstood the discussion about the bug happening / not happening, and thought I needed to specify something that could be unique to my scenario.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2023 17:55

aye, it was a 1 line fix
I had to take a line that was above an if
...and put it IN the if
lol

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/08/2023 17:55

Well then, as far as I can tell that's all the 117 bugs I encountered, surely there isn't some subtle one yet undiscovered...

@ HeroOfFireZC big thanks for the comprehensive bug reports you filed over the last week!
