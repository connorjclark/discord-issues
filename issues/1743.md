What it says on the tin. Would be useful for implementing algorithms in ZScript (e.g. pathfinding, etc).

Welllll
It looks like I've done a thing successfully
...just gotta document it all

YOO
Dope

At first I tried to implement this with `std::vector` because that's what I'm familiar with
but, that lacks `pop_front` or `push_front` capability
...and a quick google tells me trying to use that with front access is stupid, and `std::deque` is far better sorted for my needs.
`deque` == `double-ended queue`, so, made for insertion and removal at both ends.
```
/////////////////
///   Stack   ///
/////////////////

long Size;
 * Read-only. The size of the stack, given as a LONG.
 * This means that a stack with 5 items will have a size of '5L'.

bool Full;
 * Read-only. Returns true if the stack cannot hold any more elements.

void Clear();
 * Clears the stack of all elements.

void PushBack(untyped val);
void PushFront(untyped val);
 * Pushes the given value to the back or front of the stack.
 * If the stack is at max capacity, does nothing.

untyped PopBack();
untyped PopFront();
 * Removes the back or front element of the stack, and returns it.
 * If the stack is empty, '0' is returned.

untyped PeekBack();
untyped PeekFront();
 * Returns the back or front element of the stack, without removing it.
 * If the stack is empty, '0' is returned.

untyped Get(long ind);
 * Returns the element at the index 'ind', which is a LONG value.
 * This means that '0L' is the first element, '1L' is the second, etc.
 * If an invalid index is given, '0' is returned.

void Set(long ind, untyped val);
 * Overwrites the element at the index 'ind', which is a LONG value, with the value 'val'.
 * This means that '0L' is the first element, '1L' is the second, etc.
 * If an invalid index is given, nothing happens.

void Free();
 * This will deallocate the stack pointer, so that the pointer ID may be re-used.
 * There is a limit to how many stack pointers may be allocated at once,
 *     so be sure to free them when you are no longer using them.

void Own();
 * Grants 'Ownership' of the pointer to the currently running script.
 * When the script terminates (at the same time any Local Arrays in the script
 *     are cleared), the pointer will be automatically freed.```
I used `long` for the sizing, so, accessing using indexes will be a bit weirder than arrays
but, that means that the max number of elements is `2,147,483,647` instead of `214,748`

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) adding to thread, incase you're interested in what I've done here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:45

Small thing, but I wouldn't call this a stack if you can access front and back. Why not call it Deque since that is what it's wrapping?
Could also just call it Vector, since Deque is a dum name
@TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) did you need a Has method too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:47

Well, `Queue` indicates add-end, read-begin
`Stack` indicates add-end, read-end
....but those are the two commonplace names that would be less likely to confuse people.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:48

I think Array or Vector themselves are pretty generically used across other languages to support both modea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:48

I've only heard `vector` in either a c++ context or linear-algebra context, myself

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:48

Not in cpp tho

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:49

or, P5Js I think I've heard it too, but that's usually referring to an X,Y position/direction vector
which is entirely different

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:50

Ex in Js arrays support both

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:50

I could call it `Array`, but well

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:50

via push, unshift, pop, shift

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:50

having an object called an `Array` that is not the same as `int foo[5];` seems purely confusion-causing
because you can't do ```cpp
int foo[5];
foo->push(1);```
you have to create the special type for it
and use the functions
which is probably why C++ went with `vector` instead
though `vector` in C++ does not handle front-end access
so it isn't even properly comparable to that
Summary being, names are confusing, there are a lot of 'technically' more accurate names, that would be more likely to confuse people, especially given that a lot of people who start using ZScript have no prior coding experience

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/15/2022 21:52

C# does List instead but is even more generic (can insert anywhere)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:53

While `list` does sound better
it's a more common word in general
so making that a reserved keyword would be more likely to break old scripts
which is another concern we have to deal with
`switch`/`case`/`default` already did a number on old scripts due to that, though, they are important enough to keep the names they have in most languages
I don't feel like many people likely have variables named `stack` though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 21:57

also, webdocs added

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 07/15/2022 22:13

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) did you…"): For what I was adding not yet, might still be worthwhile though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2022 22:14

I'm done with this for today, but, further requests can certainly be made
