Request in title. Would also nice to have the option for a sound when the trap collides with a solid combo.

I think traps MAKE a sound when they collide with a combo, but it's not settable per-enemy.

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "I think traps MAKE a sound wh…"): Constant traps do, but not line-of-sight
