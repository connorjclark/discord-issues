See title. Video demonstrates throwing from a grounded state, then throwing whilst airborne.

I presume this is because the jar in the video is instantly colliding with the player

=== @ Phosphor 06/22/2023 20:48

Nah it's probably it somehow colliding with the floor, because if thrown atop a nonsolid combo like a sideview platform or ladder, it does not instantly break

..I don't know if I handled sideview.....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/27/2023 12:57

so uh yeah throwing is just using `z`
throwing won't work properly in sideview at all lol
not enough energy to fix now, will have to do later

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/02/2023 03:31

Fixed!
Also, `LW_THROWN` weapons.... were just ignoring their weapon script. That's also fixed.

@ Phosphor test when you get the chance?

=== @ Phosphor 07/03/2023 14:35

Yeah I can

=== @ Phosphor 07/05/2023 16:05

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Phosphor test wh‚Ä¶"): Confirmed

=== @ Phosphor 07/05/2023 16:08

Huh, does the pot in sideview follow a parabolic arc or a hyperbolic one? I noticed it keeps a constant slope of descent after the initial throw, as if it's following an asymptote

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2023 17:06

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It has a step speed for horizontal and gravity for vertical
but it can't fall more than the terminal velocity
same as any other weapon/enemy/the player

=== @ Phosphor 07/05/2023 19:24

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "It has a step speed for horiz‚Ä¶"): I guess that'd be more like a parabolic arc until reaching terminal velocity. Both velocity vectors would be static, so it'd appear to move at a constant rate diagonally

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/05/2023 20:26

yeah, pretty much

=== @ Phosphor 07/05/2023 20:46

Just thought it was weird at first since I usually see games approximate projectile motion with a parabola. I guess those games don't have terminal velocities
