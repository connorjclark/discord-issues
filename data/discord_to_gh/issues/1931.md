Scrolling from one map to another does not properly change the cset.  The first time it keeps the cset of the previous map.  Going back through the warp changes the cset to that of the new dmap but transfers the pallete back to the first dmap
Quest where the bug happens.

I fixed the issue by getting rid of the Z2 lantern script

No, don't
Can you test if the bug is fixed
The way it was
Please

@ Jigglysaint ?

=== @ Jigglysaint 10/12/2022 16:18

testing it now

=== @ Jigglysaint 10/12/2022 16:21

Okay with the Z2 script, the cset still changes before the fade out but the destination dmap cset is correct

=== @ Jigglysaint 10/12/2022 16:29

okay even without the script the cset changes before the fade out and scroll
but the destination cset is correct

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2022 16:30

k, that sounds correct
