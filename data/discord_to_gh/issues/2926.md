Getting a report that AdjustMusicVolume only works if Broken ZScript Volume Access is enabled, or at least it is the case for spc files

Also the case for GBS files, Moosh is aware of that though

@ Moosh

It not working specifically with trackers rings a bell, though IDEK why it wouldn't. Is it working with midi and regular enhanced music?

=== @ Moosh 12/23/2023 17:05

Possibly related to tracker volume not updating with regular volume controls until you reset the area?
Music emulation stuff is scary. I wouldn't call this one "not a bug" but possibly not one I know how to fix if so
because I know at least some of these formats just straight up do not give control for adjusting stuff mid playback

set volume not implemented for GME

> case ZCMF_GME:
>             // need to figure out volume switch
>             break;
it's just a a4 audio stream so this should be basic

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 20:55

I fixed that in zcmusic.cpp. I did not verify the zscript part.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/09/2024 19:07

Considering this fixed

=== @ mitchfork 01/09/2024 19:59

is this fix pushed in the jan 8 nightly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/09/2024 20:52

should be
Ctrl f music/gme in the changelog folder to double check

=== @ mitchfork 01/09/2024 21:02

it's there. I just tested the script access and it is adjusting the volume but there's a difference in behavior now

=== @ mitchfork 01/09/2024 21:04

```    Audio->AdjustMusicVolume(0);
    Audio->AdjustMusicVolume(100);```
in old versions of ZC this would kill the currently playing music track. Now it doesn't

=== @ mitchfork 01/09/2024 21:06

...there does seem to be `Game->PauseMusic()`, but that is deprecated per the documentation
http://puu.sh/JYsNF/a00600893d.png
there's no other way that I see to kill a currently playing enhanced music track

=== @ mitchfork 01/09/2024 21:11

(replying to @ mitchfork "```    Audio->AdjustMusicVolu…"): Would like this behavior as-is though. lots of cutscenes across my projects are broken by this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/09/2024 22:06

Was that working just before this change? I don't see how it could be related to this recent change but maybe some less recent music change

=== @ mitchfork 01/09/2024 22:13

I don't have an easy way of checking because the music volume adjustment wasn't working at all for gbs until this

=== @ mitchfork 01/09/2024 22:16

but possible that the greater moosh updates changed this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/09/2024 22:18

the great moosh

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/19/2024 04:02

(replying to @ mitchfork "there's no other way that I s…"): Game->PlayMIDI(0);

=== @ mitchfork 01/19/2024 04:02

that just works for enhanced music?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/19/2024 04:02

yeah
or at least, it was how you'd do it in 2.53

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 04:03

I presume playing any midi by script would change from enhanced to midi, no?
`PlayMidi(0)` does directly just call `music_stop()` though

=== @ mitchfork 01/19/2024 04:03

ah i see

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/19/2024 04:07

(replying to @ mitchfork "it's there. I just tested the…"): @ Moosh could you check this out?

=== @ Moosh 01/19/2024 04:36

So what I'm seeing here:
- When using the "Old (Buggy) ZScript Volume Access" flag, the behavior is consistent between both versions
- When using the new volume stuff, it still works, but you need to move the AdjustMusicVolume(100) to right before playing the new music instead of directly following the mute

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 04:38

(replying to @ mitchfork "...there does seem to be `Gam…"): also btw
that says deprecated by other pointer types
because EVERYTHING audio related on `Game->` is deprecated
by `Audio->` existing
(so, `Game->PauseMusic()` is presumably deprecated by `Audio->PauseMusic()` existing)
(unrelated to issue at hand, but, noticed scrolling up)

=== @ mitchfork 01/19/2024 04:39

(replying to @ Moosh "So what I'm seeing here:
- Wh…"): I think this is right
In older versions you needed to set back to 100 directly following mute because it also affected wav SFX
but that's properly decoupled with the new volume stuff

=== @ Moosh 01/19/2024 04:40

So this would indicate old volume code just kills music if volume hits 0. This IMO is pretty useless to keep because of the PlayMIDI(0) thing. I could of course add a QR for it if you really want to be using the new behavior but want it to do that. Is this a thing you need? I imagine it'd overall take longer than just doing find in all files in your script and replacing those blocks with PlayMIDI(0)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 04:40

...except, uh, apparently `PauseMusic` doesn't exist AT ALL, and `Game->PauseMusic()` was a misdocumentation in the first place
(ZORIAAAAAAA)

=== @ Moosh 01/19/2024 04:41

bruh

=== @ mitchfork 01/19/2024 04:41

loooool
(replying to @ Moosh "So this would indicate old vo…"): Yeah that's reasonable I think
It always felt kind of hacky the way I did it anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 04:42

`Audio->PauseCurMIDI()`, using the ZASM command named `PAUSEMUSIC`, exists though
presuming Zoria just documented wrong
probably read the zasm command name and just used that as the function name
HAHAHAHA
BUT IT GETS BETTER

=== @ Moosh 01/19/2024 04:43

Believe you can get a janky enhanced music pause going by combining other commands.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 04:43

THEY DO NOTHING AND DON'T WORK

=== @ Moosh 01/19/2024 04:43

fuckingggg Zoriaaaaaaa
I mean to his credit this indicates he at least tried at one point and I wouldn't want to do this either because midi is AAAAAAAAAAAAAA

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/19/2024 04:44

these ARE in the docs, without anything indicating that they don't work

=== @ Moosh 01/19/2024 04:44

but why document it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/19/2024 05:04

his entire philosphy was "document and promise features first, add them later"
