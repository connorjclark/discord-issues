should the isInfo case offset `ref` by `NUMSHOPS`?
also, should declare `ref` variable first and do all bounds check on that, so help GCC evaluate the range of the term. I think only one of these errors are real b/c it doesn't know about the first bound check.
lots more errors like this, and too-small char buffers for sprintf functions, here: https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/actions/runs/5947716133/job/16130232290
