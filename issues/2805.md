Here's a big one. This is from running `hero_of_dreams_1_of_8.zplay`

The biggest total time here is 15% `getTileModifier`, which is already being addressed.

`do_layer` (9%) spends all its time in `overtile16`

`masked_blit` is a big 6%. I changed that to `blit` to see what would happen, and some particles get drawn over the subscreen (example: `classic_1st_lvl_1.zplay`). Is this only for clipping the top where the subscreen is when drawing the map screen? If so, maybe we can use a simpler blit w/ a clip rect instead.

I believe with that subscreen clipping fix QR turned off, stuff like Tektites or Pols Voice can clip into the subscreen.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 19:11

This particular call to masked blit occurs always, I think what handles that is somewhere else in this function

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 21:17

> and some particles get drawn over the subscreen

(had this backwards - some particles are _no longer_ drawn over the subscreen)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 21:20

the intended draw operation starts with this in a temp bitmap

then uses masked blit on this other bitmap which contains the subscreen...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 21:37

Aye, that seems needed with that setting

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/01/2023 08:55

Making some progress on removing that masked_blit and even the temp_buf. Will likely need to accept a gfx change like this : https://screen-draw-refactor.surge.sh/ but arguably it's a slight improvement. (Don't see it? look around the top of the rocks)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 09:13

lol, no one will notice that
so, seems perfect

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/01/2023 09:33

before and after

(the NES fix for "Subscreen appears above Sprites" QR is off for this quest)
so I'm considering this a bug fix even, given the QR text

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 09:36

huh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/01/2023 09:37

i didn't grab the same frame for the before/after but the point is the jumping enemy should go over the subscreen, as the QR text says should happen when off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 09:39

yeah, just... interesting
(that was more of a `huh, weird` than a `huh?`)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/01/2023 09:40

oh ok
lemme try again

there we go

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 09:40

does appear to be a bugfix as you say based on the text

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:33

`draw_screen` is now ~35% (from removing masked_blit, temp_buf, and adding a cache for tilemod) 🎉

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:39

nice!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 21:12

full report on how removing the temp_buf / masked_blit changed things ( https://github.com/connorjclark/ZeldaClassic/commit/27f66826cd78fceff07560fa61f489deb8f30cd5 ): https://hoten.cc/tmp/compare-report-screen-draw-refactor/

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 21:13

it looks as I've described it above - all these quests have "subscreen draws above sprites" QR _OFF_, so it makes sense that now some sprites don't get drawn over by individual subscreen elements. But I'm wondering if somewhere in this giant report is a bug with like...msg strings (which I had to change in this commit too) but that I'm just not finding
sooo @<role: Developer> if people could just randomly look around https://hoten.cc/tmp/compare-report-screen-draw-refactor/ that'd help. point out anything that is a problem. I haven't found any yet..

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 21:15

you can check "show only unexpected frames", then click on a frame (the second track, so you see the new version), then _hold right_ to cycle through all those quickly enough

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2023 21:16

the tektites

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 21:16

kinda fun if you enable the delta mode and you get a strobing effect..
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "so I'm considering this a bug…"): @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2023 21:17

they're jumping over the subscreen, but the difference is that the frame is either drawing above or below

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 21:17

did I read this QR text correct?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 21:18

Seems correct to me, so that would be a bugfix not an error

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2023 21:18

yeah that seems like a bugfix (assuming the top is the old and the bottom is the new)
sorry brain isn't on

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 21:19

i found this tho
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1168985501521428500/1169747735612764170/image.png?ex=65ea2f79&is=65d7ba79&hm=1f50f045823cdb1a7744ce42b2bbe6615b3188204a8e17ea1214e72faa4ae312&)
I'm gonna argue that if there is no way to keep this under the subscr always (even with this flag off) w/o a temp_buf / masked_blit, the perf cost just isn't worth it
but let's look for more..

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 21:21

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I'm gonna argue that if there…"): ?
What's wrong here?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 21:22

before the sword was under the subscreen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 21:22

... Yeah, the sword is a sprite, just like the tektites
Same bugfix
No?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 21:23

yeah its the same but kinda feel different ... but then again if the tek is there and you can hit it with your sword you want it consisent
sooo yea all the same.
is this really how NES zelda 1 works?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 21:23

It's obviously a weird behavior
But it's what that rule says it does

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 21:23

dems the rules

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 21:23

Might be NES, or might be older zc compat

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 21:24

we don't make them we just support them forever

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2023 22:51

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "is this really how NES zelda…"): yep
