This problem is returning!  I go to play ZC for a few minutes and suddenly closes on me and I go to reopen ZC, Mcafee has quarantined ZC.  I don't know if it's just me. This is the latest nightly.

Mcafee is a virus, sooo
(...frankly most antivirus programs behave more like viruses)

You would think McAfee is a real antivirus since most users have it on their computers.
I have to go through the headaches trying to disable the virus putting my computer at risk just to play ZC!

> most users have it on their computers
....where do you get that idea?
MOST people do not have mcafee
most people I know would avoid it like the plague
and would never put that shit on a device

=== @ cbailey78 12/13/2022 19:22

It was just my guess.

Anyway, I really don't know what we can do against antiviruses
they really just don't like the most stupid shit
and would rather destroy millions of legit programs than let a virus slip through
....which really is worse than most viruses

Just exclude the folder where you keep ZC from your virus scanner.
I suggest removing third party virus scanners and just using Windows Defender.

pahaha, as though WD is any better

McAfee should be ProVirus!
