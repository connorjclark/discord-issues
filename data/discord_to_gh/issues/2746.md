Basically, I'm asking for a button (like the jump buttons for the numerical color specifiers) that makes the color you have selected appears in the slidey tool in the top/middle.

I'm pretty sure there was a reason this wasn't a thing
like the calculation was too difficult or something

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/15/2023 04:36

I thought that might be the issue, however there are plenty of ways to reverse-engineering hue/saturation/brightness
I don't know off the dome how to do it but I don't think it's too different from how stuff like, say, photoshop lets you represent RGB colors as HSV

@ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 05:39

looking at how this works I am chuckling right now. So how does this palette editor calculate the HSV values? Well working backwards, it calculates the final color by mixing the RGB of a hue color with a gray color using the value slider on the right. It gets the gray color my mixing white and black with the Y position of the color crosshair. Okay then. So how does it calculate the hue color it's using? Big fuckoff array.

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 05:42

So I could try to reverse the process with color math but it might not be 100% accurate because there is no fancy color math happening here. Just a bunch of linear interpolation

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/15/2023 05:55

I think close enough would be a lot better than trying to eyeball it, especially for the color-wise uninitiated

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/15/2023 05:59

likewise, if it makes it more straightforward to be able to reverse engineer the colors (without much extra effort), I don't think the color picker needs to replicate how it chooses colors to perfect precision to how it does now; consistency between the values it produces and the position of the sliders is more important than making sure they produce the exact same colors as if you produced a color currently by using the sliders

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 06:00

yeah I'm looking into it right now. It does seem like a useful feature

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 06:07

So which works better do you think, having the jump buttons jump to a color or having clicking a color jump to that color?
Imagine the former, cuz there's some places where the latter could make you lose your place when editing

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/15/2023 06:22

Former
Latter would be annoying for the reason you described, yeah
For some reason I vaguely remember it working like that in the past but maybe I'm buggin

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/15/2023 06:24

It might be worth reorganizing the color picker in general
Since the layout is crazy all over the place
but that's a separate thing, and idk how hard that is (hopefully not very, one would imagine you could just use different pixel values to change the positions of the UI elements)

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 06:26

I wanna reorganize it but that'd be the start of a complete rewrite and I told myself I wasn't throwing myself down that rabbithole just yet 😛

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/15/2023 06:28

word

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 07:12

Oof, this is really off the mark. Like not just a couple pixels off from the original values, it's  giving a visibly different color and differrent spot on the chart. Which I guess shouldn't come as a surprise, the math is completely different and seemingly even the range of hues is weighted differently.

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 07:29

here's a demonstration of how skewed it is, the image from ZQ on the top, the range from my functions on the bottom. They definitely did something to give the hues a more even distribution

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 07:33

This seems like it'd be easily fixable if I knew what functions they used to generate that array but for now I'm left kinda stumped

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/15/2023 07:40

oh interesting
do you mind elaborating on which function you used

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 07:41

https://easyrgb.com/en/math.php
RGB->HSL from this page

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 07:43

Gimp's color picker for example looks more like mine than ZC's. I'm wondering if maybe the old ZC devs just took an image of the gradient and like...stretched and squashed it so the colors would be more uniform

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/15/2023 07:43

that'd be crazy if so
lmao
uhhh
I wonder if it's using HSV instead of HSL?

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 07:44

I thought maybe so too, but that didn't seem to work either

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/15/2023 18:45

(replying to @ Moosh "here's a demonstration of how…"): Question though, do these _need_ to match?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2023 18:45

^

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/15/2023 18:45

If the gradient is slightly different but the colors it produces are the ones you expect, would that not suffice?
That's what I was trying to get at earlier
As long as it's consistent between the numerical values and the gradient, I don't think it needs to match whatever archaic formula was used before
And worst case scenario the gradient could be swapped out in the future if the original one gets reverse engineered or whatever.
if the numbers and gradient to line up though then that's a diff issue.

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 22:32

Because the gradient is different, it gives _completely_ different colors
Selecting a green was giving me a yellow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2023 22:33

So you'd need to fix that part

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 22:33

And selecting a red was giving me pink, ect, ect

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 22:34

And I did find a very janky workaround by checking the array to find the hue, that much is possible. But the saturation and lightness were also completely wrong and giving useless data
That one I couldn't easily find a way to reverse
I think the only way to accomplish this is to totally rewrite the color picker widget, which I of course don't want to do yet

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/15/2023 22:35

(replying to @ Moosh "I think the only way to accom…"): well, that would probably be best

=== @ Moosh 10/15/2023 22:36

But yeah that is the plan eventually, and when I do that this will be trivial
just for now it has me stumped.

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 10/16/2023 17:07

Gotcha gotcha
