When selecting a combo in the FFC editor if you change the palette of the combo then exit, then the combo table in the main screen will shift to that palette.
I'm not sure where this issue arose from but it's present in older alphas.
Alpha 104 had this error.

Can confirm. I reported this a while ago as well
