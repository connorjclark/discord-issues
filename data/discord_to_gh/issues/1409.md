So you know how 2.55 fixed that thing in 2.50 where an Aquamentus etc. would make BOTH the enemy hurt and boss hurt sound when hurt? If you save a 2.50 quest in 2.55, it fixes that whether you want it to or not.

Luckily, this does not apply to PLAYING quests, as the old behaviour works for 2.50/3 quests in the Player, only SAVING them in ZQuest.
