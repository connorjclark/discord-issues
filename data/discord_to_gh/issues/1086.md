After writing to ABXY, upon opening the subscreen, the subscreen selector selects an invalid item position. Sometimes it's invisible sometimes it's where an item I removed via script used to be. I am selecting nothing and I must scream. This is incredibly annoying for multiple character systems where I want it to remember who had what items

Here's a quest and script file demonstrating the bug. L and R swap characters.

Also noted another oddity, in that newly added items are added to Y and X buttons before B and A. That priority seems backwards

=== @ Moosh 10/09/2021 05:38

Trying to figure this one out again, to at least be able to sidestep it, it appears when the item position goes invisible the cursor is selecting item 0. Or at least something that assigns item 0 when I put it on a button
That's item ID 0, not subscreen item position 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 08:43

I don't think the `->ItemA` `->ItemB` etc are really built to work well with the engine subscreen
they *override* your item selection

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 08:50

They've been working well after I overwrote the default subscreen entirely. But that subscreen was not playing kindly with giving and taking items from the player

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 08:52

the engine subscreen is a fucking mess
everything about it is bad

=== @ Moosh 02/12/2022 08:56

It's pretty cringe, yeah
Did scrolling functions for X and Y ever get added?
That always worked for selecting items pre 2.55
And if setting them directly will always have bugs with the engine default, might as well. Not everybody has the patience to reinvent the wheel sadly

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/12/2022 09:18

...nope, don't seem to exist
`SelectXWeapon` and `SelectYWeapon` need to be added

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:04

@ Moosh ```
void SelectAWeapon(int dir);
void SelectBWeapon(int dir);
void SelectXWeapon(int dir);
void SelectYWeapon(int dir);
    * Changes the A/B/X/Y button item (respectively), in the same manner the engine subscreen cursor
    * moves. DIR_RIGHT/DIR_LEFT are equivalent to how quickswap cycles.
    * A/X/Y versions do nothing if the QR allowing items to be set for that button is not enabled.```
(first 2 are unchanged, latter two built to match)

(replying to @ Moosh "Trying to figure this one out…"): It's cause of this
```Awpn = value/10000;
            game->awpn = value/10000;``` this is a simplification of what ->ItemA does
Awpn is your, well, A button weapon

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 18:43

game->awpn, on the other hand, is the subscreen position of what you're selecting

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 18:44

the problem here is getting an awpn from the A, well, weapon
cause remember, the subscreen has weird hybrid item classes

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 20:20

actually, found a simple solution, even if it's not the best: cause there's a way to convert slots to a weapon type, and there's only 256 slots, so I can loop through all the slots and return the first one that matches the current weapon

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/14/2022 20:21

it could be more optimized if I knew how to get the count of used subscreen items, because I doubt there's a lot of quests that use all the subscreen slots
I also put in a "if ItemX != value you're trying to set it to"
just so calling it every frame won't lag the game out like Link->Item[]

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) if you'd rather find a more elegant solution, feel free

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/15/2022 03:16

Sounds pretty clean

Oh boy, it's been a long while since my quest was using any part of the vanilla active subscreen.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:07

there is a flaw, in that the cursor doesn't actually save whether the last item you selected was an A button, a B Button, etc
Technically has been there since 2.50, plan on fixing it at some point

=== @ Moosh 02/16/2022 04:07

Does it differentiate?
Like the selection cursor doesn't care what it's selecting until you press a button to assign it doesn't it?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:08

Currently, it just loops through B, A, and I forget the order of X and Y, in that order, and grabs the first one to set the cursor to when you open the subscreen

=== @ Moosh 02/16/2022 04:09

Gotcha. Makes sense

=== @ Moosh 02/16/2022 04:10

~~Now to make a puzzle quest involving activating the bugfix to access otherwise inaccessible subscreen regions contained in closed item loops~~

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:11

you can notice it in stuff like Isle of Rebirth in 2.50.2 or whichever where you have, say, the candle on B, and then you go to select the sword on A; since the sword was the most recent thing you selected, it really should be on the sword when you open the subscreen, but it defaults to the candle cause that's what's on your B button and B button gets priority
but that's an unrelated bug to this one; just another flaw with the subscreen I need to fix at some point

=== @ Moosh 02/16/2022 04:12

A little funky but not as bad as what it was doing before

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:12

ye

=== @ Moosh 02/16/2022 04:12

And for my purposes, goddamn I have fallen in love with DMap subscreen scripts

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:12

it'll at least no longer select invalid items, and will actually try to grab your selected items
subscreen scripts are great

=== @ Moosh 02/16/2022 04:13

Recently added a fourth subscreen tab with three sub tabs. And was momentarily concerned for my ZASM usage until I remembered that one script in 2.55 can hold as much ZASM as the entire 2.53 script buffer 🤦

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:14

lmao yup
it can hold expontentially more ZASM

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 02/16/2022 04:17

(10000 times more ZASM, to be precise)
(all because we fixed a dumb typo error thing)
