I know this is probably a tall order since no one has touched this stuff in ages, but here goes:

I'd like some improvements when it comes to playback of tracker files, what specifically comes to mind for me is .nsf and .gbs, other formats might be applicable too, but I'm less aware of their shortcomings if so.

For .nsf it's just more broad support that is needed. Most widely used expansions aren't supported (FDS, VRC7). Some VRC7 using files run fine though, but most of them don't.  These chipsets were fairly rare when it came to games that used them, but most composers who still make chiptune tracks for the nes/famicom use them. 

For .gbs, it's less of a support matter and more of bad playback. Some files just don't play properly in ZC, missing instruments or having instruments sound widely off compared to the official game.

There's been a lot of recent changes to how GME and DUMB (the libraries that plays these formats) are included in ZC. Specifically, we now build the latest versions of them instead of using old ones.

Wait until the next nightly (the latest one has a timer bug that affects music tempo) and give it a spin, let me know if anything has improved. Both libraries have had changes since they were added to ZC, so perhaps there's been some improvement.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 03:02

For anything beyond simply integration (are there formats these libraries support but ZC hasn't used yet?), you'll have to engage with the library developers. For example, for NSF you should talk to the people behind GME. https://bitbucket.org/mpyne/game-music-emu/wiki/Home

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 03:38

Next nightly should hit #deleted-channel in ~20m FYI.

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 13:49

oh, neat
that sounds really good, actually

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 14:14

downloading latest, .nsf files that uses the VRC7 now indexes properly in ZQ, which is nice. They are missing channels during playback, however.
I don't really know what exists
But this music library seems long since discontinued

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 18:03

Right, it's not actively developed but the guy does respond to things occasionally.

Missing channels---does that mean some sounds aren't playing in a track or that there are missing tracks? (I don't know what channel means in this context)

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:06

oh
a channel in the context to music is like... think of an instrument in an orchestra being missing

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:09

A channel is generally limited to one sound wave type, like square wave, etc
so VRC7 tracks play with missing instruments, essentially

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:12

assumedly the not playing ones are the extra channels added by the expansion chip

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:15

Got it. Will you reach out to the GME people about this? If they fix it I can update ZC.

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:15

uh, probably not #socialanxiety

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:16

But there might be better playback libraries that could be used?
idk

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:17

No. That is definitely not an option.

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:17

it seems kinda awkward to go ask them to update in the first place, since it's not the original authors
oh
because of the old architecture ZC uses?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:18

Because no one is crazy enough to support all these formats in one place
Except whoever made this one

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:18

this is true I suppose
and you can't incorporate multiple ones? And be selective which one focuses on what format?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:19

Anyway, the sooner they get a bug report the sooner someone will fix it. Just give me the nsf file that is not working and eventually I'll file a bug

is mostly anything VRC7
but compare playback of this in other players and in ZC
etc

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:20

It mostly works we aren't gonna toss it out because one format doesn't have support of the enhanced version... We just need to let them know it doesn't work.

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:20

yeah, no I get it
I just wished this worked, essentially
so I was spit balling solutions

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:24

Oh, and what software do you load it in to that does work?
https://r32.github.io/wasm-c/ that sound like you expect for the file you gave me?

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:31

I use a foobar2k plugin, give me a few mins and I'll check this web player

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:35

I'm only getting the drums in this web player too, actually

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:36

weird

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/08/2022 20:38

Ok jw. Web player is unrelated just the first thing I found online
What's missing when played in ZC?

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/08/2022 20:38

hard to articulate, but all melody outside of drums
for this specific file
