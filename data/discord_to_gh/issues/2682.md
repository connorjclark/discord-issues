When working in "Auto" combo mode, the floating Combo Brush that shows you what you're about to draw reverts to the combo you've selected in Normal combo mode.
Ideally it should actively predict what you're about to draw, the same as it does in Pool mode.

Yup
was just talking this in Pure. Getting it to draw "something" should be trivial but getting it to preview the combo being drawn might be a bit of an adventure
