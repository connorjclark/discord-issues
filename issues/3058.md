Isn't it just like a single calculation or function somewhere that determines how it works, it can't possibly be a mass of spaghetti governing how to generate the colors. 

For clarification I mean specifically make transparency more intuitive somehow so that it's more of a tint or something instead of just calculating the middle point between two colors or whatever it currently does. 

Idk

My dream would be for there to be different blending modes for translucency, like addition or multiplication. Yeah you usually won't be able to show the true multiply color product with the limited palette, but who's to say it can't just approximate it with the closest available color like it already does with the already-existing color mix mode?

an addition, soft light, or overlay color mixing mode would make fancy lighting layers a lot prettier than right now, where light shining through a window onto the ground looks like a square cloud floating above the floor. Multiply would make translucent shadow sprites and combos blend much better with surrounding graphics
