There should be a list of numbers denoting what layer different objects appear on, including their default. The reason being is that I am faced with the troublesome task of putting "held items" on the highest visible layer available. If there were a list of layers things will generally appear on(in different states, if necessary) I wont have to write such garbagey and hard to maintain scripts. Thank you.

Most sprite objects appear between 2 and 3, and most 'overhead' objects appear between 4 and 5, where those categories are split

I have been requested to write a script that moves both the held item and Link to the top layer during his item collection animation. How does one even access the held item information anyway
