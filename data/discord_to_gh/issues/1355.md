Rules for A, B, L, R, EX1-4 to be dedicated to using the highest item of an itemclass, if you own it. The itemclass for each button is set in Game Data
-Z1/Z3 swords
-Jump Button (Roc's Feather) for sideview quests
-Z3 Bracelet, Z3 Pegasus Boots, Run Button, and other scripted items
...this is probably gonna suck but I see people asking for a jump button script all the time.

So I at least have a better motive for requesting it than some of my silly "why not" ideas
