I'm pretty sure I set everything up correctly but for some reason, light beams (spotlight combo) on a moving FFC will not pass through unsolid light trigger combos. "Blocks light" is not checked

Latest nightly sep 29,
Map 1, room 0x18 (24)


Also, the FFC light beam is shifted/displaced when passing over the light trigger combos. Only the placed ones (black squares).

The same light trigger combo is on a moving ffc at the bottom of the room and it seems to interact normally with the moving light beam. 
Also I set the light beam's width to 16. The question mark button doesn't specify if it's pixels but I assume it is. 

Kept testing as I was writing this and light beams placed normally (not ffc) also do not pass through the unsolid light trigger combos.

so, the offset
....is because the compat rule `Broken Lightbeam Hitboxes` is enabled.
Also, I'm not sure that targets WORK on ffcs currently- don't think that was implemented
.....but the `Blocks Light` flag is not working properly for some reason still
....oh wait no
that's an error in the test quest as well
the unlit version has `Blocks Light` checked
....but the lit version, that it turns into when hit with the beam, does not
so it gets hit, stops the beam, lights up, and then next frame the beam goes through
so, @ Majora, 0 bugs, multiple user errors

works perfectly fine when set up properly

wait, but no
nevermind
because the beam is *activating* the trigger on the ffc
but it isn't blocking
....bleh
because activating it is handled in one section of code
but the blocking is handled with the typemap of mirrors/etc per *combo position*
so is not set up at all to read ffcs
which, would be an issue from when triggers working on ffcs was first added, which.... was that me, or was that Deedee?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2023 10:18

regardless, it would require the same type of work as allowing FFC mirrors and such to work
which is.... a lot.
*technically* a bug I suppose, but the fix would be to add to the `?` button for `Blocks Light` a line saying `Does not work on FFCs.`

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "*technically* a bug I suppose‚Ä¶"): ^ I'll leave it to you deedee whether you want to actually make this work, or add this to the info text. Whichever is fine by me, not gonna ask from you the effort of doing this if you don't have the energy for it, because.... oof, this does not seem nice.
