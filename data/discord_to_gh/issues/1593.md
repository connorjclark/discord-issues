at least (non animated) GIF, and bonus for PNG. The purpose would be to be able to have crude/basic cutscenes and other visual flair. For instance, a "splash screen" when you enter a new area. This could work like enhanced music, but if possible within a subfolder. if not integrated into the quest file itself like a MIDI.

Even though ZC has generous tile space, in my opinion making cutscenes/etc. out of tiles is hideously inefficient. I make this suggestion with the assumption that it would be slightly less work in the long run to implement image importing

I know doing anything with the GUI immediately saps the will to live, so the compromise would be that images can only be displayed/manipulated via scripting. The slightly less compromise would be adding a tab to Screen Data that just asks what image to display (and the pixel coordinates of the image's top-leftmost pixel that defaults to 0,0) , and things like scrolling/rotation/whatever are left to scripting. The image would just be a simple object that draws under the hero on layer 0. bonuses include being able to have it be on other layers the way you'd do so for normal tiles. 

Image dimensions could be capped at some multiple of 256x176. Probably 3x, both for file size reasons (maybe GIF can be larger than PNG) but also not to upset allegro 4 or the ZC engine code too much. 

and uhhhh that's all I got. I can't think of other considerations but the overall point is just to have one GIF/PNG exist on a screen as a simple object.

You mean something like this?

Or this newer video of it implemented in an actual quest

nah I mean cinematic shots. You know how in A Link to the Past in the intro, it just shows you the overworld map and then zooms into hyrule castle? if they wanted to say, show a frontal angle of the castle they'd need to draw the tiles for it instead of just being able to zoom in. that kinda thing, if that makes sense.
(also 10/10 on the oblivion guard dialog lmao)

But yeah, ZScript can import images last I checked. They have to be indexed still but you don't need to eat up tile pages to do cutscene images at least

=== @ Majora 05/05/2022 04:01

oh shit really? I had no idea.
hell yeah

=== @ Moosh 05/05/2022 04:02

I'm pretty sure that's how I did that second one. The first one I manually ripped like 200+ images into ZQuest and it was _pain_
FMV is still not a good idea in the slightest. It's painful and wasteful no matter which way you slice it

=== @ Majora 05/05/2022 04:04

oh yeah no I don't mean full motion videos. videos are ass. just y'know the occasional uniquely/artistically drawn shot once in a while with maybe some basic "animation" like panning/scrolling or parallax
also forgive me I switched back to discord halfway through your video because I thought it was a tile-based cutscene and did not see the actual punchline, holy fuck i'm dying.

=== @ Moosh 05/05/2022 04:04

lmao
I thought it was weird you didn't react to the punchline

=== @ Majora 05/05/2022 04:05

ITS SO SMOOTH
i'm like "wait a minute 200 images??? [immediately resumes the video]"
just gonna add that to the ol' youtube downloader to preserve for posterity

addendum to original post: apparently what i'm requesting already exists so unless my original post mentioned anything that doesn't exist, it is entirely redundant.

Can't do animated gifs
but any other basic image type should indeed be loadable
