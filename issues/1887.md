```cpp
static void a5_timer_rest(unsigned int time, void (*callback)(void))
{
    double start_time = al_get_time();
    double current_time = start_time;
    if(callback)
    {
        while(current_time - start_time < (double)time / 1000.0)
        {
            callback();
        }
    }
    else
    {
        al_rest((double)time / 1000.0);
    }
}```
`a5_timer.c`
that uhhhh
that is definitely an infinite loop
`while(current_time - start_time < (double)time / 1000.0)`, nothing there changes those variables
so that condition will ALWAYS be true

....and a damned simple fix.

What's funny is that I fixed this already but it got reverted during the midi slowdown stuff
