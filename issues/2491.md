Could we get a feature so that zc remembers if the View L2/L3 as Background buttons are pressed upon reopening the editor? I use this often since if I use L2/L3 as a background layer I'm usually doing it across an entire map and not just random screens, so it's a minor annoyance to have to repress the button.
