The clickable area for all elements is offset vertically in the launcher on OSX

This bug has actually been around for a really long time, it is still present as of `nightly-2023-10-22-3` for OSX

In case it's a M1 vs Intel issue, here's some other specs
`Chip: Apple M1`
`macOS: 13.2.1 (22D68)`
`Display: 13.3-inch (2560 √ó 1600)`

It's possible this is windowed mode only, I can check on fullscreen later

=== @ colin 10/24/2023 06:20

Just checked, click targets are placed appropriately in fullscreen.

The top bar appears when fullscreen but is hidden under the system top bar in windowed mode. The click offset seems to be about the same height as the top bar. Maybe the top bar is being included in the click position calculation when it shouldn't be?

I had the same issue on OSX and checking the "Ignore monitor scale" checkbox (for ZC Player, Editor & Launcher) fixes it for me

=== @ colin 10/25/2023 15:57

yeah that works, notably the top bar reappears if that setting is active

its default size is a bit of a size for ants, but resizing works

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 07:41

@ Rebonite do you also have a M1?
all good on my intel mac. last I tried with a M1 window sizing was wacky tho, wonder if that's the common cause

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 07:45

(replying to @ colin "Just checked, click targets a‚Ä¶"): huh, I can never get a windowed app under the top system bar on my mac. Monterey. Is that a feature of newer Macs?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/28/2023 07:47

nah its a setting in General. Still no repro w/ that on.

=== @ Twilight Knight 10/28/2023 11:35

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@ Rebonite do you‚Ä¶"): yes (for work, I could never afford it myself üòÇ)

=== @ Twilight Knight 10/28/2023 11:36

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "nah its a setting in General.‚Ä¶"): if it's possible to detect M1, maybe those "ignore monitor scale" checkboxes could be ticked by default for that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/29/2023 19:09

1. Does resizing window just once also fix for you both?
2. Does fullscreen mode zplayer have things cut off?

I have a fix for the reported issue here, but for the fullscreen problem I found on this M2 only I don't yet.

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 19:23

will check now

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 19:31

I made a screen recording that's processing, but here's what I saw

on `nightly-2023-10-29-2`:

When `Ignore Monitor Scale` is false, the click targets are incorrectly positioned and the top bar is hidden

When `Ignore Monitor Scale` is false, resizing the window causes the top bar to get exposed and the click targets are properly positioned

When `Ignore Monitor Scale` is true, the click targets are correctly positioned and appear to be correctly positioned even after resizing. The top bar is exposed in this instance

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 19:38

let me check some fullscreen stuff too

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 19:39

> Does resizing window just once also fix for you both?
Looks to be that way

> Does fullscreen mode zplayer have things cut off?
I've seen no issues related to cutoffs with respect to zplayer or zquest, all issues I've noticed here apply only to the launcher

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 19:41

fullscreen launcher looks to have correctly positioned click targets as well, I show full-window in the recording, but actual fullscreen seems to work
so the incorrect positioning appears to only be when `Ignore Monitor Scale` is false, it is windowed mode, and the window has never been resized

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/29/2023 19:42

Yeah the fullscreen thing the allegro ppl with M1 don't see either. It's only on my M2..

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 19:43

^ you referring to zplayer there?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/29/2023 19:43

Btw all the monitor scale thing does is multiply the size used to create the display. So it's just that for some values of that things are busted on Mac. Maybe it's only when the height exceeds a certain value
(replying to @ colin "^ you referring to zplayer th‚Ä¶"): Yes, however it'd be zplayer and zeditor.
I'm afk but I'll try later setting ignore monitor scale to true, and seeing what height effs things up
Perhaps it is whatever the height is minus title bar and dock.

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 19:45

it sort of seems like it's related to the top bar? Like, maybe the calculation is assuming the top bar is still present, but OSX hides the top bar automatically in certain cases for whatever reason

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 19:53

oh hilarious; ok the offset is even *worse* if you have the OSX menu bar set to always be shown

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 19:54

resizing and everything still works as before though

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 19:55

I can't reproduce zplayer/zquest offset at all though

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 20:03

I think you're onto something about this happening when the application's a tad tall. Check this out

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 20:07

so, the top bar isn't being hidden by the system bar or anything, it's just being cutoff
hacky solution, if osx, just use 90% of the default monitor scale? üòõ
(for launcher)

=== @ colin 10/29/2023 20:47

`static void allocate_crap()` lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/29/2023 21:02

yeah it's def it being too tall. and allegro doesn't know it got adjusted until a resize event comes in.
But then that makes it all squished! cuz it fucks with the aspect ratio

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/30/2023 03:24

The nightly coming out in the next hour should have the issue reported here fixed. Please test and let me know, thx!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/30/2023 03:25

@ colin btw what IDE is that? Atom?

=== @ colin 10/30/2023 03:54

CLion

=== @ colin 10/30/2023 03:56

it's a JetBrains IDE, I did a lot of Java work in IntelliJ and so I think I'm permanently in that ecosystem of IDEs due to familiarity

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/30/2023 03:56

Yeah jet brains be good

=== @ colin 10/30/2023 04:26

works üëç

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/30/2023 04:46

thank lordy

=== @ Twilight Knight 11/02/2023 17:47

I've been able to test this just now and also confirm it's fixed @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
