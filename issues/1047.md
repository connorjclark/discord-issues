Attempting to load DoR in the latest nightly is yielding some seriously strange results. Many combos have wonky CSet2 properties and cset offsets

Here's what one of the sample screens look like

Here's what one of the combos looks like in the editor

According to Russ CSet2 was set to 1 in 2.53. Now it's 15
Clicking a combo and clicking OK also changes it to 11

well this just jumped to next on my list... but I'm in the middle of adding #975

. . .

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 05:51

Same combo when viewed in 1.92
So it's meant to be shifting the tile back 1 cset

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 05:51

hmmm

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 05:52

Here's how the sample screen looks

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 05:53

Combo page in 2.53 looks consistent

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 05:53

so, the error is that `-1` is being wrapped improperly

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 05:53

That would seem to be the case

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 05:53

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 05:54

Hopefully this is the only combo field being interpreted incorrectly...
Cause it'd suck to start a quest and then run into the discovery that my whole combo table had been corrupted :/

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:19

definitely @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic/commit/0be2f8f5328ba3a67e5b9e9ff437f0722bc83ffa
this isn't a problem I foresaw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:21

see if you can figure out a good way to handle this, Dimi....

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:23

....also, why would you `vbound` and then `%12`? the modulo is supposed to be doing the bounding there, so the logic is slightly off

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:25

So, it seems that the issue is of sign
because the 0-16 value range
was treated as `-8 to 7`
....so, uh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 06:31

something like
```cpp
if(loading_old_version)
{
    int cs = temp_combo.csets&15;
    if(cs&8) //sign bit
    {
        cs |= ~int(0xF); //bitwise shit to make it correct
        temp_combo.csets = 12+cs;
    }
}```
...won't work perfectly, but will fix most situations
it won't fix it if csets 12-15 were being used
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 's change to fix, when she's up to it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:05

....except wait, no
I know a better way to fix this.... dammit
now it's in my head so I guess I have to code it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:42

see how this build treats you

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:43

gimme a sec while windows detects a new virus ü§¶

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:43

fun

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:44

"No current threats" fuck off and let me open the damn file
...what the fuck windows

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:45

windows is real nice sometimes
in all the worst of ways

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:46

I genuinely have no idea how to allow this build :/
Every other one, it gives me the warning, I tell it to allow it, bing bong goodbye
Here it pops up for a second, the immediately deletes the file

maybe it'll like a zip better

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:50

That fixed it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:51

confuse the virus-like antivirus via compression

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:51

It's weird because it still catches it and gives the exact same warning, but doesn't auto delete if it's in a zip

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:51

great job windows

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:52

Also I can add exclusions but only at an exact path. eg, a file named zelda.exe in my downloads folder but not any file named zelda.exe
That seems like an important distinction to be able to make

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:52

yep I hate that so much
guessing it doesn't like `*/zelda.exe` as a path, huh?

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:54

That would imply being able to specifiy a path as a string, rather than with a file picker dialogue ü§î

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:54

oof
probably a string somewhere in the registry.... totally safe to edit, right?

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:54

Maybe if I hack up some registry shit it'd work, but it's not worth that level of effort

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:55

Anyway, to the issue at hand
there's a compat QR, should be enabled when loading any quest saved before *this build*
with it on, cset2 will work exactly as before

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:56

probably sound like a boomer here but this just shows how infanitilized tech is becoming.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:56

also, independently fixed the issue with negative values

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:57

I recall I used to complain about odd issues with windows usability but at least back then they could trust the user to use their own shit
And yeah, DoR appears to load properly now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:57

now do `pick ruleset: modern`
and see if anything changes
(or disable the compat rule on the last tab)

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 07:58

Modern ruleset doesn't appear to have changed anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 07:59

k, so most of the issue was the separate bug
the QR affects the wrapping of csets, so if you have `CS 11, CS2 +1` that will go to `CS 12` in old quests, but `CS 0` in new quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 08:01

Any chance you have time to test #975 ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/26/2021 08:04
