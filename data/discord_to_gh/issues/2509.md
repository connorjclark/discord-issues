You seem to in some scenarios be able to hit them at an angle, in which case the player is not moved to the centre before the screen starts scrolling.

It's decently easy to replicate, but hard to get every time.

It's very easy to trigger by accident randomly, however.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 18:06

Need a replay file please

This looks very hard to reproduce otherwise

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/12/2023 09:38

How do I get one of those?
I've not really produced one before. Do you also need a quest file for it to work with?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/12/2023 15:36

I think everything you need to know is in docs/replays.md
Yup, need the qst file too

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/12/2023 15:37

Best way is to enable the "record test mode" option (in zquest launcher settings). Then just get the bug to happen in Test Mode. It is output to "replays/" folder

You can verify the replay is there and works by playing the replay from the player's system menu.

=== @ Mani Kanina 07/14/2023 11:51

Right, I'll try and get a file. @ Lunaria

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 17:44

Cool, thanks!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 11:54

think I have an idea what the problem is

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 12:03

okay, yeah
```if(((dtype==dBOMBED)?DrunkUp():dir==up) && ((diagonalMovement||NO_GRIDLOCK)?x>112&&x<128:x==120) && y<=32 && tmpscr->door[0]==dtype)
        {
            walk=true;
            dir=up;
        }``` it's not checking x.getInt()
but if this block runs, it later sets x to x.getInt()

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 12:06

so there's a small window where x gets rounded to 112 or 128 directly; these values are evenly divisible by 8, so the corner shoving code of the bomb wall thinks it's already done.
easy fix

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 12:28

noticed a small quirk with up facing bomb walls with the freeform dungeons rule turned on (it sucks you 8 pixels further away than it should), turned off freeform dungeons to confirm that nonfreeform dungeons do some walkability stuff, and...

boy, that wall ain't right
i tell ya

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 13:58

```if(isdungeon() && currscr<128 && dy<32
        && ((x<=112||x>=128) || _walkflag(120,24,2,SWITCHBLOCK_STATE))
        && !get_bit(quest_rules,qr_FREEFORM))
        return false; //Old NES dungeon stuff``` @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) pretty sure this is supposed to return true (scr_walkflags for hero)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 16:15

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) out of curiosity, did you test newer hero movement with freeform dungeons turned off?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 16:18

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 16:19

all those dx and dy were mx and my before
resulted in some *very* jank collision, and I'm curious what the point of mx and my even are in this function

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 16:25

I'd really appreciate some explaination of what the arguments for this are

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 16:28

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) out of‚Ä¶"): oh, did I test newer hero movement? uhh
(I did not test every case, that's what testing is for, thus bug reports)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 16:29

yeah
```bool HeroClass::scr_walkflag(int dx,int dy,int d2,int mx,int my,bool kb)``` the thing is that it has both a dx/dy and an mx/my
I'd assume the dx/dy are the pixel it's checking for the movement
but in that case what is mx/my doing?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 16:33

I'd really like to know so I can figure out if something is wrong with any of the function and catch it instead of waiting for bug reports

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 16:38

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "but in that case what is mx/m‚Ä¶"): top-left of player hitbox?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 16:39

yeah, looks like it's doing that

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 16:54

nothing in the function looks like it needs mx or my
in fact I think a lot of things using mx and my are causing bugs with the ladder
gonna clean this function up

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 18:36

nice, thanks

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 18:37

yeah there were quite a few problems
ladder is now working with newer hero movement

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 18:37

niceee
and respawn points i see

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 18:38

it's possible I missed something but hopefully I fixed the majority of issues with newer hero movement

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 18:39

woowoo thanks Deedee ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è <:hugheart:1012188325790089317>
