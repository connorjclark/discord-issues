L, R, and Map are currently missing.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 02:54

err, L/R are not missing?
A,B,L,R,Ex1-Ex4 are valid
this is the same 8 buttons that can be used by signposts, chests, combo triggers, and most other stuff

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 02:57

Oh fuck, I'm blind lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 02:59

Map/Start are not valid, mostly because a byte has 8 bits and when I originally set up signs/chests to use this system I put it on an attribyte
so the entire "check these boxes for each button you want" system is designed around those 8 buttons

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 03:00

gotcha

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 03:04

Of course Map is the button I want. But maybe I can do my own input polling via script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 03:04

honestly should be simple enough
you can by script start a transition with whatever parameters you want

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 03:05

```            if (Input->Press[CB_MAP]) {
                Trace(111);
                this->TransClock = 1;
                this->TransType = TRANS_TY_SLIDE;
                this->TransArgs[TRANS_SLIDE_ARG_DIR] = DIR_LEFT;
                this->TransArgs[TRANS_SLIDE_ARG_SPEED] = 12;
                this->TransFromPage = 1;
                this->TransToPage = 2;
            }```
this doesn't appear to be working for me. Might be page numbers are 0 indexed internally

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 03:06

> int TransClock;
>  * The timer clock used by the currently active transition.
>  * '-1' indicates no transition. Writing to '-1' clears the current transition.
>  * Writing a positive value starts a transition if none is currently active.
note that writing to that *starts the transition*
so, you would want that to be last

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 03:07

ahhh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 03:09

also, writing it to 1 will start 1 frame into the transition
I think writing 0 should be what you want
(writing `-1` is cancel)

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 03:10

Actually, I'm noticing a discrepancy there with the documentation. `Trace(this->TransClock)` returns 0 when there's no transition active

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 03:10

oh?
...yep
that's a typo

was just missing the highlighted part here
should be fixed next nightly

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 03:12

So it's proper to be -1, not 0?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 03:12

it should be -1 yeah

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 03:12

okay, I'll keep that in mind for updating then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 03:12

it's more likely in any situation that the docs are correct and the implementation is wrong
(the docs are written out in english as I intend, vs code where one typo fucks it)

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 03:13

Also, another one...
```bool TransFlags[];
 * The flags for the current transition.
 * Use the 'TRANSFLAG_' constants to access these.```
There don't seem to be any TRANSFLAG_ constants
oh what the fuck
I'm so blind today

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 03:13

disregard
lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 03:16

lmk anything else you find or any other questions ❤️

=== @ mitchfork 10/12/2023 03:31

No, seems like most everything is working as expected now, I'll just have to update my conditionals once the 0/-1 thing is fixed. Only other thing I might add is a note in the doocumentation that the pages are 0-indexed internally, since in the editor they are 1-indexed and this tripped me up for a bit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/12/2023 03:31

well, they are an array
arrays are 0 indexed pretty much always
unless they explicitly say otherwise
