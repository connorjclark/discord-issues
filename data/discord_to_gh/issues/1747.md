It would be neat if in combo editor, in the triggers tab (or its own new tab) you could flag combos to be permanently changed and saved by the trigger through ScreenD[] stuff. This is just a vague idea, mostly to try to figure out multiple lock blocks requiring different keys on the same screen (would be limited to 8, and would deny with a pop-up if attempting to do more)

would be way too complicated

I was just thinking that it would be too complicated in combo stuff. Maybe it would be easier in screen secrets? Instead of like burn or sword trigger tabs, a new ScreenD[] tab, that instead just saves if that combo changes at all (as opposed to how)?

. . . ????
screen secrets are all-or-nothing, either the whole screen triggers or none
stored in a single screen state

so I don't understand what you're trying to say there
the appropriate way to use screen->D
is to use a script
soooo
