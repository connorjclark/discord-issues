as per the #deleted-channel message:
i've just jumped up to the newest nightly from b107, and i was wondering why some of my enhanced music wasn't playing? 
first screenshot is the newest nightly, and the second is from 107.

i have another gbs file in the quest as well but it works fine. 🤷🏻‍♂️

=== @ tacochopper 09/02/2022 12:41

happy to share the GBS files for reference if need be too

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2022 15:26

yes that's needed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/02/2022 16:33

Also there's an open big report for the same thing.
Bug

=== @ tacochopper 09/03/2022 01:17

oh huh, more you know
I’ll upload what I’ve got after work - currently have an older version that works on 107 on my google drive

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/03/2022 03:35

Cool, the more examples the better

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/03/2022 03:40

I'd expect Nightly 2022-07-05 to be the first version it breaks

=== @ tacochopper 09/03/2022 08:03

Yeah the nightly I have been using was… 28-6-22 I think

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/04/2022 02:33

I was thinking of https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/998367633890082836 which is about looping, so may be different (but similar) bug
(meta) thread name was changed: 🔓certain enhanced music not recognised in latest nightly

=== @ tacochopper 09/04/2022 21:36

Uh, it isn’t a looping issue as much as it can’t read the file’s playlist? The files loop fine.
I’ve had similar issues before with other .gbs files, but I don’t know why the current version doesn’t read the gbs files I’ve been using the same way. Re-downloading “fresh” versions of the files makes no difference either 
I’ll upload what files I have shortly - just been busy with work and my partner’s birthday over the last few days

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/07/2022 07:38

I'm aware it isn't about looping, however that was a note to myself that the same changes that broke looping likely broke this.

Please upload some example files.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xsDeaKSgDP_46I41LDrIbsZjfa3r7gou?usp=sharing

specifically the CGB-AZ7J-JPN.gbs file

=== @ tacochopper 09/12/2022 03:58

i'm gonna check if it persists in the latest nightly. i've been having script issues in the 106/107 build i was using from june so i'm just gonna keep updating regularly i think

=== @ tacochopper 09/12/2022 04:00

yeah, still there

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/15/2022 02:53

@ DeletedUser those files are 0 bytes, so of course they won't play! 😛
Was that a mistake in the upload to Drive, or were you trying to play those files in zc?

=== @ tacochopper 09/15/2022 04:56

erm
hmmmm
that's interesting
they were the same files as what i had on the demo upload on the pure database
should be updated now @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
i have no idea why they were 0 kb tbh

=== @ tacochopper 09/15/2022 05:00

in saying this i was testing additional gbs files and it's having the same outcome

merging duplicate: #1863
not just .gbs it seems
@ DergerSwerson

=== @ tacochopper 09/17/2022 03:17

the plot thickens

=== @ tacochopper 09/17/2022 03:18

Also, was searching for my own shit out of vanity (and also people having issues with the quest) but I suspect this is the exact same issue https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/985631030759280650/991142067025748088
cos there is midi in parts of the three crests demo I never removed from the early stages and that's probably what was looping

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 03:18

err, that's.... a midi
not an enhanced music
so, no, it is 100% not the same issue

=== @ tacochopper 09/17/2022 03:19

nah so the entire quest was running on trackers

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 03:19

Enhanced Music and Midi are entirely separate systems

=== @ tacochopper 09/17/2022 03:19

i was lazy and didn't take the midi out
oh nvm I thought the lack of tracker playing at the time wouldve helped here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 03:20

err, oh, so you mean, it shouldn't have been playing a midi in the first place?

=== @ tacochopper 09/17/2022 03:20

Cos in theory no midis should be playing in that quest at any point
Yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 03:20

well, yeah
that
that would be literally what happens
when an enhanced music
fails to play

=== @ tacochopper 09/17/2022 03:20

yeah again me dumb

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 03:20

for any reason

=== @ tacochopper 09/17/2022 03:20

Ignore this lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/17/2022 03:21

keep in mind that if the person just... doesn't download the music files
that it will play the midi
that's fully intentional
and how enhanced music works

=== @ tacochopper 09/17/2022 03:25

yeah ofc

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2022 00:21

@ DeletedUser I can play the OoA.gbs in zquest and change the track just fine
did the music only break in-game for you?
> specifically the CGB-AZ7J-JPN.gbs file
oh

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2022 00:23

alright ditto on that, plays OK in zquest

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2022 00:31

also working in zelda player
