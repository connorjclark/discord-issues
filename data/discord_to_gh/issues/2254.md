Don't have a good explanation for this one. As of the build from March 18th, swords do not work in the quest In The Lost Kingdom of the Banana Blood God. They work in Alpha 107, so roughly sometime in the last year, it broke. Can't imagine why. They're just regular ZC swords.

=== @ Ether 03/31/2023 02:38

The glitch first appears in Alpha 111, in the December 14 nightly.

=== @ Russ 06/09/2023 01:18

LadyLone realized this glitch occurs on screens with NPCs
I looked at the NPC script
```        while(true){
            if(this->Data>0&&Link->PressA){
                Link->InputA = false;
                if(Link->Dir==DIR_UP&&Link->X>=this->X-8&&Link->X<=this->X+8&&Link->Y==this->Y+8){```
Bug is almost certainly related to changes to Press and Input

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 05:25

I don't undertand the bug report. What's the problem? What does "not work" mean?

I started test mode on a random screen and gave myself a sword. Seems to work fine.

Please specify a map/screen to test if it needs a specific one.

=== @ Russ 06/10/2023 10:30

Any screen which has an NPC on it, apparently. See the above
The starting village has plenty of NPCs to highlight the problem
Signposts also create the problem

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/10/2023 11:54

by "not work", you can't use the sword at all
it's as if you were jinxed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/10/2023 11:58

the code linked above is what would be preventing it it seems, as it's disabling the A Button when you press it. For soem reason you could still use the sword in older builds when this code was running despite that

Welp indeed…

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 19:45

Does it seem fair to say that the npc script only worked because it relied on a bug with input handling? It's clearly setting the A input to false anytime it is pressed, so isn't the expectation that the A item would be unusable?
I don't recall the intricacies of input/press/whatever, lets see where I wrote that down...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 19:47

Maybe it should only be discarding the A input for the _first_ frame the button is pressed?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 19:49

@ Russ does that script do anything else with PressA (like write to it?)

=== @ Russ 06/10/2023 19:50

I don’t believe so but I can provide it to you later
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Maybe it should only be disca…"): I wanna say it’s something like this?
Input and press were always weird
If I absolutely wanted to kill an input, I had to hit them both
I also worry how prevalent this may be
Lone tells me LotH has the same bug
And this script or ones based off it could be in many quests

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 06/10/2023 19:52

I think if this is a bug, it should stay fixed, but we should compat the old behavior for quests before a certain version
I say as if that's a profound thing and not just every compat issue ever

=== @ Russ 06/10/2023 19:52

lol
That seems reasonable
Bananas has broke due to bug fixes without compatibility checks before
The bitmap offset from 2.5.0 to 2.5.2 for example
Past a certain point, can’t rely on people to update ten year old quest in response to new bug fixes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 19:54

I don't want people to ever need to update a quest, except for when they decided to resave in a new version.
all bets be off then lol
i feel like the loading/saving qst code is a rat nest of hidden bugs
sorry to mix metaphors

=== @ Russ 06/10/2023 20:41

lol
Understandable

Notes-

Bug does not happen if on replay version 7 (and probably below too).

This patch prevents the bug (but likely breaks other things):

Actually, this might be the fix. Nothing seems borked.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/12/2023 06:10

I'll have a test build up soon.

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) do you recall what bug these changes were fixing? https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/5b9edea27bf8ad41bbef95297697d462653a7f4c

we have `input_down_bug_v8.zplay` which used `ToNDemo3Nov30.qst` to test a fix for the bug where the map screen could not be closed. That, and all the stuff `keys.zplay` is doing, still work without doing `rButton(ret, *flag, &rawret)` or setting `down_control_states` every frame.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 06/12/2023 16:41

`down_control_states[]` not being cleared every frame caused issues with the lift glove and roc's feather, IIRC, as well as offsetting many player inputs by a frame

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/14/2023 01:32

Anything specific, or if I try those two items and they work for basic usage then all is good?
> offsetting many player inputs by a frame

hmmm I'll need to think of a way to test for this

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/14/2023 01:42

lol you can jump while lifting something
you can also lift while jumping

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/14/2023 05:06

Not seeing any issues with this fix, gonna land it.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/15/2023 18:43

This was fixed btw

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/15/2023 18:44
