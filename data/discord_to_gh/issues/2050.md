After beating the first quest on a normal, non-custom quest game and moving the file to the second quest, the sword swing animation begins to be trying to use the "swinging in an arc" animation rather than simply thrusting the sword out as in the original game, which causes visual errors as seen in the screenshot.

I just downloaded the latest nightly (Nov 23rd 2022)  and just to see if it was a thing specifically native to the Second Quest, I typed in **ZELDA** as my name and hopped on in, collecting the sword and stabbing.  It looks normal.

So I guess we have to actually beat 1st.qst normally then go to the 2nd quest to try to validate this bug.

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 21:34

I actually forgot to mention, but yeah, even for me this does not happen with the ZELDA password.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 11/25/2022 21:34

Neat.  What a unique bug!

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 21:34

So yeah, super pain in the ass bug to test I guess lol
There's actually a couple of things I noticed in my little vanilla playthrough that I was going to make reports for as well

=== @ tim 11/25/2022 22:05

this means its loading a different quest
or
the cheats broke?
weird

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 22:06

I did disable all the cheat buttons since they conflicted with the controls I did want to use.  Idk if that could affect it though

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 11/25/2022 22:06

I don't think cheats are enabled on the official 1st-5th quests by default, as far as I know.

=== @ tim 11/25/2022 22:07

no other way to get slash in a quest that doesnt have it

=== @ tim 11/25/2022 22:08

but idk why it would break on quest load

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/25/2022 23:17

Are you supposed to hit _cancel_ when making a new save file to not do a "custom quest"?!
Was wondering why I couldnt hit the inc_quest function...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/25/2022 23:22

confirmed this slash bug in latest nightly

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 23:26

Yeah, if you just click okay, it loads the 1st quest as a "custom quest"
Not sure if that's intentional or not

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/25/2022 23:27

That dialog popping up automatically is a UI kludge to make it simpler to load custom quests
And this is the unfortunate side effect
if you see "classic 1st" and hit OK...you'd expect the actual original game w/ the 2nd quest advancement

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 23:28

No advancement for 1st.qst loaded as a custom though

=== @ Mega Moses 11/25/2022 23:29

Should've mentioned that too since I did actually have to replay the first quest because of it
Luckily not a long game at all or anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/01/2022 13:13

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "if you see "classic 1st" and…"): ...oh FFS, this is not intentional
it should be the module version
bleh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:18

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "if you see "classic 1st" and…"): Working on fixing this, but there's some code related to registering files that is web-specific; not sure if that has the same issue, not touching it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 22:50

Pushed a fix that should fix that. I missed the damned return val needed an `&& customized`, forcing a false return if you used the default quest.
Do note that if you `Browse` for a file and select a module quest, it will still treat it as a custom quest; and this is intentional behavior, as you have not loaded it via a module. But only if you `Browse` and select `OK` in the browse menu- otherwise, if it's just showing the file default, it leaves it non-custom.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/12/2023 19:26

bump for myself.

btw should be able to just cheat GOTO to ganon, no need to truly replay the quest (i'd assume) for the repro

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/22/2023 08:11

Looking at this, but quickly found a bigger problem. insta-death when beating 1st quest and starting 2nd.

https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/876908472728453161/1165562462054133852
`qr_CONTFULL_DEP` QR ends up setting `zinit.cont_heart` to 100, which ends up carrying over to 2nd quest. `cont_game` uses this value and decides its cool to set the life to 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2023 08:23

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "`qr_CONTFULL_DEP` QR ends up…"): not sure why 100 would set it to 0 anyway...
or, actually, wait
...`resetItems()`, the first 2 lines are in the wrong order, aren't they?
it sets the life BEFORE the max life
.....I uh, already fixed that in my refactor branch, given that many of the variables surrounding it have been entirely renamed and refactored

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/22/2023 08:32

why does the order matter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2023 08:34

imagine the max life were for some reason cleared to 0
Set the starting life to the starting life... which gets bounded by the max life, to 0
THEN set the max life
....you die
the key point being, setting a counter is bounded by the max of that counter when the set occurs
so the max should require being updated FIRST

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/22/2023 08:38

i don't see any bounding happening in resetItems in those first two lines you mentioned

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/22/2023 08:57

`game->set_life()`?
...oh wait
does `set_counter` NOT actually bound?
...that's fucking weird
.....swapping the two lines fixed at least AN issue related to spawning with the wrong number of hearts, soooo

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 01:29

Checking back again - and now quest progression has broken. Does not change to 2nd.
Was working a couple weeks ago ( https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/804484dddfee5373a7ca07436da38aaf459bc58a )

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 01:35

the game `quest` value was 255 in ending.cpp (shoulda been 1)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 01:41

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/commit/acb7c848170c77210c385586d38bd2b0d2e8fd0b#diff-2dbb93c39665d5fd3fc746f0ac9979014cb31fcba202c43d6580195ff06ab633#L2289
bad merge

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:51

fuck, what?
<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>
it passed all replay tests

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:51

there is no test for quest progression

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:52

funn
....is it time we just remove the quest progression crap?
because that sounds like a better idea to me

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:53

since it involves title menu interaction, it'd have to be a python test that loads a winning classic_1st.zplay into a save file (and replay mode does not save explicitly....) then reload that same save slot and check...something
but yeah, I do wanna remove it, but not for 2.55
it makes some sort of sense to have it if we provide 1st and 2nd

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:53

eh, but we also already (years ago) removed the main purpose it served
because the main purpose was
you COULD NOT load the 1st/2nd/etc quest files manually
it outright errored telling you "nope, do the progression"
....we removed that long ago to allow you to just pick them

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:54

you also get a neat icon when you beat 1st quest and progress to 2nd
same for the next ones

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:54

yeah, hardcoded icon jank bullshit...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:54

so it's a bit different, @ Moosh says some people love this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:54

<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092>

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:55

Hopefully it's not much to get this working again. And the sword glitch this original issue is about may not even be a bug related to progression, so we should confirm that...after these other bugs are sorted out.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:55

I have honestly 0 clue where something would be wrong for this shit
because AFAIK I changed nothing related to the `quest` value
I changed a COUPLE things in gamedata, but did not full rewrite it
and none of those changes related to `quest`
and init data is unrelated to `quest`, right? That's part of `Header`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:56

mhmm I'm not following, did you see the line of code I linked to?
you simply accidentally undid i change I made.
or are you talking about something else

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:56

oh?
your link didn't go to a line
it went to my entire merge

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:57

ugh that lnk broke..

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 02:57

directly to `containers.h` changes
if it was just an accidental reversion then *whew*, thank god
(got me panicking over here lol)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/02/2023 02:58

you literally cannot link to this
github ui bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2023 03:01

(For the record, this happens when I pull and then forget to reload a page in notepad++ that was already open before editing it)
(...very easy to do sometimes when quite tired, though usually I catch it before pushing. And honestly most often if I don't it results in compile errors, but, this one in particular wouldn't, obviously. Oof.)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 00:58

OK, we are back to progression to 2nd quest working.

I confirmed that the original purpose of this thread - the sword animation glitching - is still present.

Also, I noticed that on starting the 2nd quest I only had a single heart. It should have been full.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 08:30

@<role: Developer> could someone else take a look at this bug?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 16:43

sword not slashing would be `game->get_can_slash()` being wrong
my assumption is that the init data for the 2nd quest is not applied properly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 20:14

re: health, `game->set_hasplayed(true)` is done on inc_quest (line is >5 years old), so all "firstplay" stuff is skipped in init_game. that seems wrong

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 20:16

changing that  also fixed the sword issue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 20:17

@ Mega Moses fixed! (for next nightly)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/06/2023 20:19

nice

=== @ Mega Moses 11/06/2023 20:19

Ay!  Thank you!
