=== @ P-Tux7 10/28/2021 22:43

same as above
@ Moosh i recall you scripted some of these quirks into armageddon quest 2. any that you did besides the windrobes?
(meta) thread name was changed: 1.92 2.10 compat bugs

=== @ Moosh 10/28/2021 22:45

Believe windrobes were the only thing

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 00:12

okay so 2.53 (and 2.55?) has native code for the windrobe thing in the emulation menu
now all that needs to be done @<role: Developer> is making it auto-run when quest ver is 2.10 or less
(instead of the emulation menu)
oh sorry for the ping i thought developer was just emily and dimi

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 00:15

yeah nope it's a few people
try to direct ping instead of role ping

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 00:17

i didn't wanna single anyone out but yeah

=== @ Moosh 10/29/2021 00:23

It was my understanding I thought that emulation rules were made optional rather than mandatory because different quests were made for different subversions of ZC, especially in the 1.92 days
It's a messy solution but then ZC is a messy program

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 00:23

nah iirc it was because 2.50 was out of QRs to auto-activate

=== @ Moosh 10/29/2021 00:24

Right, the reason they're a toggle menu, not the reason they exist in the first place

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/29/2021 00:26

@ DeletedUser made them

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 00:27

not to put too fine a point on it but i don't think he cares anymore

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 00:33

of course we're free to reuse the code though

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/29/2021 06:17

I was going to make the windrobe fix an enemy flag, not a qr, for 2.55 and auto enable it for older quests.
Same for other enemy fixes.
Some of the emulation could become rules.
Some may be best to keep as emulation options in the player.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 17:54

yeah, i was going to feature request that since OUCH! has stated they prefer the old windrobes
though i couldn't do it here since this is strictly for bugs

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/29/2021 19:06

Enemy variation always belongs on enemy flags, not on a global rule.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/29/2021 19:58

oh yeah and from 1.92-2.10
"rope 2s do not flash" should assign them cset 9, not 8

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 02:08

#1142

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 07:59

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) speaking of armageddon quest
has the whole "door repairs in gamble dungeon never exhaust, they keep draining you every time you enter because it's in a dungeon" thing been emulated
i thought it was a rule in 2.50.2 already but i remember someone complaining that it broke in 2.50.2

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 08:00

hmm

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:02

oh and also while we're at it
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&id=744
(744)
would you mind asking ouch what broke and needed changing for 2.53
because they'll care more if it's from an actual dev

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 08:06

robber's mansion most likely
the left path was broken because of lanmolas not counting as ringleaders IIRC

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:15

oh mm
fixed yet? dare i ask

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 08:28

no clue
I think they did something else for that room

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:40

so what's the issue
they DID or DIDN'T count in 1.92

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 08:41

they did count
every other enemy in the room is a phantom ghini
unkillable

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 08:50

well that's odd

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 08:59

so for some reason they no longer killed those ghinis when they died

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 18:26

@ DeletedUser which 1.92 version swapped cancel and wavy warps

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 20:53

build 163

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 20:54

@ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 20:54

thanks!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 20:54

fun fact, the rule internally is named qr_192b163

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 20:54

well then

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 20:54

and before was emu192b163

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 20:54

sorry for the ping timelord

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/30/2021 20:55

thank god, cause I couldn't find the topic about it on the old dev server

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 21:12

@ DeletedUser out of curiosity do you have any of the four(?) "1.93" builds

=== @ P-Tux7 10/30/2021 21:23

ok so link's bad hair day 4 confirmed to not be bugged in B104. let's see about 183 now
(for reference, the bug is that the overworld's "cave" things such as text and shops show on their respective overworld screen without you entering the cave)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/31/2021 13:24

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "@ DeletedUser out of…"): No, I have a set of *seven* 1.93 builds.
I am uncertain what differentiates  '× from 'ws' designations
I have alpha 4 as d, s, w, and 'ws'
Alpha 5 as dos and windows
And alpha 6 as windows

=== @ P-Tux7 10/31/2021 17:50

lay em on me please

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/01/2021 14:56

I will wait for @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) to make a channel so that no-one have a reason to complain about ot posts.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/01/2021 14:57

#deleted-channel

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/01/2021 14:58

That works
It was specific to 1.92 before
1.93 is 2.50 alpha
Err
2.10 alpha

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:04

OH GOD OH GOD

this upgraded newfirst from 1.92 beta 68b has the same issue as LBHD4
i.e. the cave guys appear on their respective overworld screens

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:11

presumably same for "newfirst_enhanced.qst" from beta 91
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903413814618378300/905096852041515058/newfirst_enhanced.qst?ex=65e72821&is=65d4b321&hm=0e9a270172290280cb6e997589afc38c78b396d680f17947dc123142c1e5f39e&

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 14:30

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i.e. the cave guys appear on…"): Oh yeah, I fixed this
Haven't posted the nightly for it yet
thanks to @ DeletedUser for being kind and helping me iron out that bug

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:30

what was the problem?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2021 14:30

dmap flags

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 14:31

there was an early breakpoint that was missed

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:31

oh mm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 14:31

and the code we had to do this was after that

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:31

looking in the quest itself it *said* the overworld map was an Overworld
are there any known quests that this affects besides Link's Bad Hair Day 4 and the two Newfirst test .qsts?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2021 14:33

it'd be every quest in that version

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 14:33

actually rambly if you can see this i'd like to ask you that, I'd like to play more of them

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/02/2021 14:33

but should be fixed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 15:00

It is fixed yeah
overworld types used to include those flags implicitly
but it wasn't actually setting those flags when upgrading to versions that split the type and the flags

=== @ Rambly 11/02/2021 16:15

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "actually rambly if you can se…"): one of these days im just gonna upload my whole quest archives
im busy lately so it might be a bit, but i'd like to
also um, mountain drew's hitchhiker's guide quest
to answer more directly

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 16:57

thanks!
also holy shit that's a thing?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 17:00

ok so i dmed ouch and the only compatibility bug that they remember is that lanmola ringleaders do not kill the other enemies when killed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/02/2021 17:34

yeah, I need to look into that

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:20

I guess that those builds were of some use.
1.90 go 1.93 bugs are by far the worst.
2.10 is not that bad

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:22

It was helpful for checking a quest I couldn't open in 2.55

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:23

2.0.0, 2.10.1., 2.10.2, and the unreleased 2.10.3 source files re all on GH as brqnches
That is why I spent so much effort pestering ppl to send w/e they had and archiving it all in a coherent manner alongside my files
Behavioural observations help substantially

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:25

granted, it's not as helpful as actual source files
1.83 source would be huge
as would 1.90 source

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:25

1.80 was only the player
The 1.50 src is the closest stopgap
There was no public zq bin until iirc 1.83

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:27

1.83 source, I meant

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:27

I was lucky to get one 1.92 zrc pack, even incomplete
Are there any 1.84 to 1.90 issues that are unsolved?
The majority of fekked up regular changes were 1.92 to 1.93

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/03/2021 14:29

it'd give a nice insight whenever it comes to quests made in those versions

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:29

Shrug
Look at the 1.50 src
It is so different that it isn't reasonably comprehensible compared to 2.50
I wrote a quest loader for 1.50 quests but never tested it
I wanted to convert Jer's 3rd to 2.53
Was meant to be the original official 3rd
And nobody in the general userbase have played it, few know it exists
I literally spent over two years hunting down what you have and pestering wl to find old media with files
The family of DNbmight still have his 20 year old drives but I did not want to ask them for something like that
DarkNation

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:35

I do not liking askeling parents of a deceased child for that sort of thing. I have been there and I know what memories it would resurface if it were done to me.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 14:37

You are 9f course welcome to do what you want.
Perhaps wl may one day find more
But you need to be on his good side and to keep on it

=== @ P-Tux7 11/03/2021 15:15

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "I guess that those builds wer…"): They were, thank you. Helped me test Link's Bad Hair Day 4

=== @ P-Tux7 11/03/2021 15:16

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "I wanted to convert Jer's 3rd…"): what version was Jer's 3rd made in?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/03/2021 15:31

1.50

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:38

note to self: check dark nation's/zc.com's reports of when standalone digdogger kids and gohma 3s and 4s were changed to never return after death for specific version

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:40

i remember a video of dcsyxx swearing while playing soshi's quest because he dies while playing a 1.92 quest in 1.92 and knows the gohma 3 that he killed will respawn as it's not in a boss room lol

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 19:35

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) has 1.92 beta 104 quests having overworld guys show up outside their caves been fixed yet?
it doesn't seem to be in a recent nightly
and is it possible for me to manually fix it in zquest for the time being

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 19:38

oh i think it may not be setting use caves instead of item cellars or special rooms and guys are in caves only, for overworld dmaps in those quests
yup setting both of those fixed it, not sure which one
probably the second

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/16/2021 08:44

....damnit

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 00:00

https://www.zeldaclassic.com/files/zc2102w.zip
doesn't work
could someone please give me windows 2.10
need to test something
someone SAID din's fire should trigger wand book fire triggers in their 2.10 quest but it's not doing so in 2.50.2
so i wanted to try and see if din's fire DID do that in 2.10 or if they just messed their quest up

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2021 00:06

um
I have it on my old comp but I don't want to boot it up if I can help it
Lemme see if I can find where I got it from

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 00:06

After dinner I'll check the link

it's not 2.10.2, it's only 2.10
unsure if it matters

@ P-Tux7

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 00:34

what is this, an install?
also yeah i actually did want 2.10.0 thanks
hah, 7zip shredded right through that

uh oh

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "https://www.zeldaclassic.com/…"): ....indeed, the link and the mirror are both broken

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 02:36

please post this on that channel
ah, they're on the wayback machine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 02:45

remind me tomorrow to fix the link
and if you could post the wayback link here

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 02:45

ok so the window is just throwing hissy fits when i try to open either zelda-w or zquest-w

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 02:45

use zlaunch

2.50.2 I had a similar issue, it would not open directly without bugging the shit out
but zlaunch worked fine

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 02:46

yeah no

deedee i'm afraid you'll have to test this one on your own
just make a quest in 1.92 or 2.10 that gives you din's fire and has a wand book fire combo flag, and see if the din's fire fire triggers that please

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/24/2021 03:08

@ P-Tux7 if you want to test 2.10 stuff, you need to do some weird stuff
you need to make a shortcut of ZQ, edit the shortcut, add "-w" after the path
should work

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:11

thanks!
does that apply to zelda-w as well?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:13

```C:\Users\PTux7\Downloads\zc210w\zquest-w.exe -w```
huh, this doesn't work
do i need to enclose either one of the "words" in quotes?
(either the file path or the -w)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:14

file path should only need quotes if it includes spaces
flags should never be quoted

=== @ Moosh 11/24/2021 03:15

Mine just looks like
`zelda-w.exe -windowed`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:15

ah thanks that worked!

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:17

...wait, will that work for anyone else?
i put what moosh said for both (changing zelda to zquest of course) but when i open the shortcuts back up it's my file path again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:27

that'd be how shortcuts work
so no
afaik to make it work for someone else you'd need to use a batch file
...which should be able to just have the same exact text in it and work

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:28

okay it triggers flag 74 in 2.10
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903413814618378300/912907547705491456/dinsfire.qst?ex=65e7e2e8&is=65d56de8&hm=81b203d9f2ef2bd25966557c9b8793d89cedcb527be54ff9821d848b37cf40c7&
okay why can't i use din's fire in the latest alpha it has no cost in this quest.
related to #1224 ?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:29

wtf

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:30

uh yeah uh no
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903413814618378300/912907952875257886/unknown.png?ex=65e7e348&is=65d56e48&hm=09a1907a2c268239976e0a1dc8e0819e3e1088dcf4d021ef63ed52391caf0bc7&)
magic was disabled in that 2.10 quest so nothing should use magic

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:31

it should cost rupees instead, then
iirc
and if the `enable magic` qr is unchecked, it should cost rupees when the cost counter is set to magic

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:34

said qr is unchecked

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:34

so it should be costing 32 rupees then
I would think

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:34

no, it shouldn't, since din's fire cost 0 rupees in 2.10 when magic was disabled
don't ask why

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:34

interesting
check if having 32 rupees works
definitely a compat bug, regardless

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:36

ok it works fine in 2.50.2
no rupees or magic needed

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:36

. . . wtf

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:36

though as i said, it's not triggering the wand book fire flag

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:36

OK, so 2 bugs
`Din's Fire triggers Book Fire Flag`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:36

so let me mod in some rupees in that 2.10 quest and see if it triggers said flag in the latest 2.55 build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:37

and `2.10 porting: if no enable magic, cost should be 0 for dins fire`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:37

*2.10.2 or less
din's fire was in some late 1.92 builds iirc

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:41

ok so 2 things
1. din's fire does not trigger the wand book fire flag in the latest build
2. din's fire only VALIDATES cost, it does not remove 32 rupees

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:41

Is the `only validate cost` flag being checked in the editor????

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:42

(go down one screen to get the 50 rupees)
no?!?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:42

What the *fuck*

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:43

again it seems similar to #1224
though in that case it DOES have enough rupees to validate the cost yet still does not work

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 03:53

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "though as i said, it's not tr…"): can confirm the 2.10 source does the check for wand fire when it goes to trigger dins fire stuff

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 03:54

need to see if it's also in 1.92 (since I believe Din's Fire was first added there) and then see which 2.50 RC it got changed in

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:42

ah
so zoria fucked the cost
it's checking rupees for the cost
but then it's charging your magic

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:48

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "need to see if it's also in 1…"): would you mind if its a qr or item setting or something that the user can set, and not just auto-changed in the zc player? i like it
since logically a bigger magical fire item should be able to trigger a smaller magical fire item's trigger

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:50

. . . you keep asking things like this
it literally ***HAS*** to be a qr or item setting
for it to function in old quests
that's not an optional thing
"auto-changed in the zc player" is not a way things can be fixed

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:51

i could have sworn at least 2.50.2 hid some of those compatibility options in zquest but i could be wrong

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:51

2.50.2 did
which is, in itself, a 2.50.2 bug
because the devs didn't give enough of a crap about compatibility

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:51

see also: sideview damage combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:52

doing it like that is not fixing the bug

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 04:52

sorry for the confusion, that must be where i got the idea that zelda.exe can automagically detect and change stuff from

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:52

it's causing a compat bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 04:59

oh blehg
the cost shit here is really messed up
god dammit zoria
there's an item flag
that is no longer editable
that controls a thing\
and wasn't ported quite right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 05:07

so this will still be broken in any quests loaded since around the time I started devving
but should be fixed for any old quests loaded in new versions now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 05:14

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "no, it shouldn't, since din's…"): this wasn't dins
it was all items
but there was a *flag* to make it cost rupees

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/25/2021 05:49

(didn't touch the wand fire flag issue, only the cost issues)

=== @ P-Tux7 11/25/2021 05:52

thanks!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/25/2021 08:11

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i could have sworn at least 2…"): Yeah, it used to, but it's easier for us to have it be quest rules and stuff
or item rules, or etc
it's gonna be an item quest rule instead of a compat rule
cause it's more subjective whether you'd want it or not, as opposed to compat rules just fixing bugs

=== @ P-Tux7 12/06/2021 03:29

Oh... it seems part of the Beta 104 bug where Guys show up outside of their caves also means that their screens are flagged to have Stairways (like you'd find in a dungeon), not Caves.

=== @ P-Tux7 12/06/2021 03:31

Oh, it's not setting "Use Caves Instead of Item Cellars" properly

=== @ P-Tux7 12/31/2021 20:24

oh dear, i'm going to have to check how "Start with 999 Rupees" works in 1.90, 1.92, and 2.10
i know that to the top (2.10) INTENDS for you to start with a full 999 rupee counter + wallet

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/31/2021 22:25

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i know that to the top (2.10)…"): IIRC it just uses init data to start you with 999 rupees

=== @ P-Tux7 12/31/2021 23:35

ah good
i was worried it was broken back in 2.10 and we'd have to emulate it separately between 1.84 and 2.10
(i wonder if that rule existed in 1.84... i haven't even downloaded that one yet because until now it just seemed like 1.90 but worse)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/08/2022 13:20

(meta) thread name was changed: 🔓1.92 2.10 compat bugs

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:52

write up report for 1.92 beta 104 (and presumably all 1.92 betas below that?) overworlds being broken - check if they are missing Use Caves Instead of Item Cellars, Guys Are Inside Caves/Special Rooms Only, or both map flags when played in 2.5x
i know enabling *both* fixes them... i just forgot to check if it's specifically one or the other

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:53

Frankly, it would be good if you could start moving anything that isn't fixed yet from these channels to #deleted-channel

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:53

those builds are kind of wacky... their quests still use 1.90 password encryption instead of 1.92's, as proven by ZCheat
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Frankly, it would be good if…"): ...yeah, that's what "write up report" is telling myself

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:53

but like
just make a thread
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "write up report for 1.92 beta…"): put this in it
and then add more details to that same thread later

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:54

oh i can? i thought it had to be the whole enchilada at the start
thanks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:54

. . .
Well these messages we are sending right now
certainly are not the first message in the thread
so I don't see what would stop you from... doing the same... in any other thread.....

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:55

because i don't intend these as formal bug reports? (at least after i requested the compat bug reports channel)
for example, there was the case of me questioning if 1.90 lanmolas/manhandlas had individual segment drops, so i made a note in that general thread to test it later
turns out they didn't
so there was no compat bug and no reason to make a thread

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 05:57

But like
you could have made a thread
and then
said `yeah nope, all good`
and closed it

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 05:59

that's fine? and not a bother? well okay then if you say so

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 06:00

it's much less of a bother than having threads that just have like 5000 unrelated topics in them
better to close things off when they are done

=== @ P-Tux7 02/13/2022 06:00

yeah ok
i'll get to it tomorrow copy pasting on mobile sucks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/13/2022 06:01

oh, fuck, yeah don't try that on mobile lol
and no particular rush
not like we're hurting for things to work on at the moment
