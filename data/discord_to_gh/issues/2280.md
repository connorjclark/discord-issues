Currently the swing of the hammer activates things such as combo triggers, it would be nice if it only activated them when making contact with the ground

Test out the new nightly (about to post)
adding a new flag, not testing it too much though

@ P-Tux7
note to self, add script access to the hammer's "position" (0=above head, 1=angled forward, 2=swung down) to allow scripts an easy handling of such
(this was not an internal thing before just now, I just added it to handle this flag, but it should be easy enough to add script access for. Just don't want to do that *right now*.)

...additional note to self, add a bool to all weapons for "NoTrigger", disabling their ability to trigger any triggers.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 02:36

```
//Hero->
int HammerPos;
 * Read-only. The hammer's current position.
 * Compare to the 'HMRPOS_' constants.
//std_constants
enum
{
    HMRPOS_UP, HMRPOS_ANGLE, HMRPOS_DOWN
};
//lweapon-> && eweapon->
bool NoTrigger;
 * Default false. If true, this weapon will not trigger any combo triggers or secret flags.```

do i need to make a new thread or can i request here a rule that the hammer only collides with enemies when in position 2, similar to how it's handled with pound combos

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 02:38

that should be simple enough

=== @ P-Tux7 04/03/2023 02:39

thanks
(...that's why in LTTP it wasn't the Sideways Slashing Warhammer of Darknut Doom that it is now)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 02:44

....errr
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "do i need to make a new threa…"): it already.... should?
pound combos are in the same function as enemies
and the early return check for it being in the air is *above both of those*

=== @ P-Tux7 04/03/2023 02:45

sorry, i guess the bigger hitbox fooled me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/03/2023 02:47

(meta, MessageType.pins_add)

Oh yes, the hammer had pretty broken hitbox in 2.53- versions. Hence why it almost always appear lategame in quests, even with nerfed damage.

=== @ P-Tux7 04/03/2023 21:34

isn't it still that way in 2.55 versions? not like you can change the hitbox iirc
at least without scripts (melee weapons are broken in that regard)
