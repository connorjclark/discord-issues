The Mirror item class should have a secondary Warp effect and sound effect, to be used when the DMap flag "Mirror Continues instead of Warping" is set, as it worked in A Link to the Past.

More additions specific to the Mirror.
A - A screen with a "No Mirror Into" flag.
B - A "cannot mirror onto" combo Flag
C - A Item Option / QR where if you bonk on these "No Mirror", you get a wavy screen effect, similar to how Oracle of Ages prevented time travel in some places.

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "C - A Item Option / QR where‚Ä¶"): This one is a bit tougher... you already have the warp effect playing

I think it just depends on how Mirror bonking works. If it loads the screen, shows it for a moment, then warps you back, idea idea is that a consistent wavy effect plays, implying something is preventing you from warping there.
(based on how it looks in Ages)

It plays a warp of whichever effect to go there
and then immediately starts a warp back as soon as the warp there finishes

Showcases the `No Mirror` flag (the orange tiles on the left have it).
Also showcases the return portal bonking you back, due to temp secrets.
The `Disable Mirror` screen flag also exists, making it treat the entire screen area as `No Mirror` flag.

Also, the continue warp effect and sfx are separately set now.
