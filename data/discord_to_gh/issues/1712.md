I was thinking that something that might be *pretty* easy for me to add after I get my feet wet in ZC would be the shovel. I understand I'm jumping the gun because I haven't even compiled ZC yet, but this is the kind of addition where thought has to be put into all the item options, combo options, Link animation options... etc. It definitely needs a few weeks' lead time to discuss logistics before even being implemented. More spitballing tomorrow

Item Editor:

-The typical like Level, Cost, Counter, Edible, bla bla bla

-Shake Sensitivity (FSA L2 shovel. Link shakes when he's a customizable distance from the diggable Screen Item. 0 for no sensitivity AKA LTTP/LA shovel)

-Weapon sprite

-Weapon Spoofing will likely not be used because the shovel has never had a hitbox to touch harmful objects, and would be a pain in the ass to even attempt to hit anything with

Combo Editor:

-Will likely use Generic combos.

-Will look into adding a Shovel defense for combos.

-Combo can use the Undercombo or the Next combo, as usual, and trigger secrets.

-"Sand" particle animation required to be added for the digging. Uses the same Misc. sprite selection as any other particle-generating Generic combo.

-Triggered sound used when dug, obviously

-Dropset used for the dug-up junk treasures.

-Armos flag and screen item used for the important treasures like secret seashells?

Link Animation
Dig Tab
-Up
-Down
-Left
-Right
Frames:
Z1/BS: 2
Z3: 3
The LTTP Shovel -> Flute upgrade can be done using Item Override.

FSA has a shovel upgrade that beeps when the player is near a treasure. This will likely reuse the Stone of Agony vibration once that's fixed

The only confusing part: how to make a "clink" sound for the combos that can't be dug up. Making it per-combo seems a little wasteful... might have to be a GameData sound effect choice that applies to the whole quest, or put it in the per-shovel itemdata.

I also need to test if Link can get hurt while shoveling, and if it knocks him out of the animation as well or not.
Again, I'm probably not gonna do this for a while, but I just wanted to make sure no one had any suggestions or better ways to implement these ideas
