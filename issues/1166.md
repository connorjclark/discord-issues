uh, whoops
got distracted while typing that
...though in fairness the tooltips weren't supposed to be out yet
I didn't mean to push them to the main branch
Wait, that's odd
it's typed out in the code...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 00:09

Post the code block?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2021 00:13

```{ "Lesser Damage Combos Take Priority", qr_DMGCOMBOPRI, "If this is enabled and you touch two damage combos at once, the one with less damage takes priority."
        " If disabled, the one with more damage takes priority."},```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 00:15

....hmm
Maybe you fixed it after you pushed?
If not, then something in the gui code is being buggy, which would suck....

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2021 00:16

might be it ye

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 00:54

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "...though in fairness the too…"): i mean, good that they were

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 00:58

first just try retyping it up to see if you accidentally formatted it wrong

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/11/2021 01:11

it works fine on my end, so I think it just got posted before I finished that string

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:13

k, thank god
(Originally, there were at least 7 different issues with making the strings auto-size correctly, so not wanting to need to rip my hair out over it again lol)

not quite a tooltip but still

(beam hearts and beam damage)
same menu

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:46

oh, fuck, yeah I should
it's `Beam Hearts` and `Beam Damage`, right?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:46

yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:46

easy enough

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:47

also while we're at it, for swords, wands, and canes, i think "quick" needs a better name
i'm having a bit of trouble thinking of one just a note to self

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:47

`No Slash Cooldown`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:47

(quick means that you can restart your swipe without having to wait for it to play through)
aha!
just change that to melee and we're golden
since it works even on non-slashing melee weapons

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:48

ah, true

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:48

thank you!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:48

does it affect beams/magic?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:48

nope

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 06:48

then yeah, that's perfect

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 06:48

they still have their on-screen limits and don't repeatedly fire if you quick-melee or anything

i am also unsure about whether this replaces the combo flagged with secrets->next's inherent flag or placed flag when secrets happen

or if it cleverly replaces whichever flag of the two is secrets->next

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/20/2021 23:19

the placed flag
the same way every other flag set in secret combos works

=== @ P-Tux7 11/20/2021 23:32

mm thanks
there's room below - could that label be lengthened to two rows please?

ugh

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "lantern class action tab"): ?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 05:53

I'm not sure why that's being cut off

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 05:57

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "?"): no space
and i think the standard is "Activation
Sound"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2021 05:58

Lantern is literally *using the default*
it has `NULL` for it's specific name for that field
also the lack of space was intentional, as it's `itemdata->UseSound` in ZScript
similarly to the other default names like `Attributes[0]`, being the ZScript access for that field

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 05:59

oh does that mean the lens needs to be changed to this instead?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/23/2021 05:59

to be fair, I'm not sure P-Tux knew that it was shared for all classes
wait what

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2021 05:59

the lens presumably has a specific name
the lantern has the default
as it doesn't actually use that field
you can't *use* a lantern, so the sfx field is not used by the engine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/23/2021 06:01

for reference
```cpp
ItemNameInfo defInfo =
{
    -1, "Power:", "Attributes[0]:", "Attributes[1]:", "Attributes[2]:",
    "Attributes[3]:", "Attributes[4]:","Attributes[5]:","Attributes[6]:",
    "Attributes[7]:","Attributes[8]:","Attributes[9]:", "Flags[0]",
    "Flags[1]", "Flags[2]", "Flags[3]", "Flags[4]", "Sprites[0]:",
    "Sprites[1]:","Sprites[2]:","Sprites[3]:","Sprites[4]:","Sprites[5]:",
    "Sprites[6]:","Sprites[7]:","Sprites[8]:","Sprites[9]:","UseSound",
    "Flags[5]", "Flags[6]", "Flags[7]", "Flags[8]", "Flags[9]", "Flags[10]",
    "Flags[11]","Flags[12]","Flags[13]", "Flags[14]","Constant Script"
};```
This is the default names array

with plenty of things using a specific name for it, usually if they actually make use of the field

=== @ P-Tux7 11/23/2021 06:04

thanks!

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:45

ok so what the fuck
apparently you can assign a flag to any Room Secret Combo Type (and flags 16-31 ones etc.) by ctrl+clicking on it
this definitely needs to be added to the gui
oh so THAT'S what people used to make torches that you had to activate one after the other

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:46

That's tiered secrets
literally the definition of tiered secrets

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:47

yeah i know but i thought you had to use inherent combo flags for that
instead this auto-places them when the Secret Combo appears

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:48

this isn't at all new
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the same way every other flag…"): ^

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:48

i know but it needs either a reminder on the secret combos screens
or just prompt which flag to use after the user selects each secret combo
(it defaulting to 0 [None] of course)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:49

something to keep in mind when that gui is rewritten

=== @ P-Tux7 11/24/2021 03:50

you added the convert water to non-solid dialog to the ruleset picking process didn't you?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2021 03:51

It used to do it without asking
I made it ask

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2021 16:35

@ P-Tux7 now that they're done
if you find any bugs or anything with QR help text, please lemme know

=== @ P-Tux7 12/20/2021 17:34

thanks!

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 02:59

ah this was it
so i think for the rule where burn flags are triggered instantly
it says that wand magic can trigger them if on, right
however it should say that "if the player has the book, wand magic will trigger burn flags as it passes over them"

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 03:01

a space too many

oh and for "downward hookshot bug", i'm pretty sure the hookshot can clip downwards through an ENTIRE combo of solidity in 1.90-2.10?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 03:05

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "a space too many"): ... there's supposed to be a slash there
`holes / triggers`

=== @ P-Tux7 12/23/2021 03:06

latter should be "DISabled"

fixed it

pffft

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/23/2021 08:48

so, the message had to be within an exact 6 pixels to get cut off
thus why it wasn't caught sooner
if it went to the 7th pixel, it'd have made a new line, which would work just fine

(this also applies to the L3 cheat menu)
oh dear um
so check either of those two menus
select an item class
and press up and down
the selected class will scroll, but the list of items on the right will not change
unless you manually click on one of the classes, but of course that defeats the purpose of arrow key scroll

it seems like the items are being listed in ID order rather than "level order and then in ID order if there are same-level items" order

=== @ P-Tux7 01/01/2022 03:05

i.e. the worn-out glove and small shield have bigger item IDs than their higher-level counterparts (due to being added later) so they are displaying at the bottom instead of the top

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2022 03:17

Saff must not have set up the lister to call it's update event on keypress

@ P-Tux7 if you want to test this to ensure nothing's wonky
And @ Deedee: If you thought maps of `int`->`vector<int>` were fun, how about maps of `int`->`map` of `int`->`vector<int>`
```cpp
map<int32_t, map<int32_t, vector<int32_t> > > families;```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/01/2022 04:03

(Laymans terms, this reads:
`Map: For each int (itemclass ID), *optionally* store a...`
`Map: For each int (item level), *optionally* store a...`
`Vector: List of item IDs`)
So for each itemclass, it stores a map which, for each item level of that itemclass, stores all the items of that level
...then it iterates through the map in the map's order, populating the dialog
so, for each family, iterate through each level; for each level, iterate through each item ID
ergo, by family first, level second, and ID last for sorting. Fun!

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 01:32

this is technically a readme thing but...
above the list of hotkeys in zquest.txt can it please be added that some shortcuts may require usage of the numpad keys with num lock on to use them on laptop keyboards?
y'know, like there's two asterisks on the keyboard, but only the numpad one works
(the list below 2.2 BASIC COMMANDS in zquest.txt)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2022 02:05

Ideally such issues could be fixed
though, like, allegro bullshit
...immediate question though, you leave numlock off ever?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 02:06

this is gonna sound really silly but yeah because if num lock is on there's this little light on the num lock key

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2022 02:07

If that light isn't on my keyboard I know something is wrong

=== @ P-Tux7 01/03/2022 02:07

oh, you've gotten used to it? very well then, i can give it a try

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/03/2022 02:07

having that off is physically painful to me
I have not had numlock off in like

also, you could do `Link` -> `the Player`; but don't use `Replace All`

Though if that's what I think it is it's awesome.
Same for the "Can cancel diving", now that I'm at it.

Yes, you can make the subscreen be faster

=== @ P-Tux7 01/20/2022 20:43

so er
"fast dungeon scrolling" applies to overworlds too

=== @ P-Tux7 01/21/2022 02:25

i feel as though this compatibility rule really belongs more in item rules. could be used strategically

i wonder if there's a more elegant way to say "big patra" in the patra size dropdown than 2x2?
i know the graphic is 2x2 for whatever reason but i'm pretty sure that the *hitbox* is the same size as the actual bs zelda patra like that one you see in classic

very very long thread... @ P-Tux7 anything left to do here?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/04/2022 03:58

What do you mean?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/04/2022 04:01

The thread is not marked closed, so is there more to do?
Don't make me read all this 🙂

Probably not given it's been awhile

Oh yeah I'll try taking a look at the newest nightly
Though there are a few times I asked for input

If the hitbox really is the same hie about "big sprite"? And maybe a note (does not effect hitbox)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/09/2022 01:06

The hitbox is made wider
