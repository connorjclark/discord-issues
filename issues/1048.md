Is this a script crash or purely engine? What's happening on that screen where it crashed and were you streaming when it happened?

=== @ NightmareJames 09/26/2021 23:17

I'll be posting the videos moemntarily
They're processing

I'm here.

=== @ NightmareJames 09/26/2021 23:28

@ Moosh The videos are up

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 23:30

So something related to the gleeok taking damage I assume

=== @ Moosh 09/26/2021 23:31

To be clear, is this the kind of crash where Windows reports ZC is not responding, the kind of crash where the window closes immediately, or the kind where the screen stops updating

=== @ NightmareJames 09/26/2021 23:36

Yes

=== @ NightmareJames 09/27/2021 14:29

Reproduced the crash in another room, this time the Pols Voice room/Like Like room with Red and Blue Bubbles.  Has something to do with Red Bubble Jinxes I believe, which were also in the Gleeok room
I could recreate all three rooms in a test quest with all the current items if needed
Quest in question

Cheat Codes:  Lv. 3:  "Phantom Menace"  Lv. 4:  "Huan ying guang lin"

Tested ZNR with the same conditions.  It did not crash.  So it's the jinx AND something else

=== @ NightmareJames 09/27/2021 15:17

Couldn't replicate it on Downfall either

=== @ NightmareJames 09/27/2021 16:30

Ruled out upgrading FFCScript to 2.0.1 too

=== @ NightmareJames 09/27/2021 16:50

Ruled out upgrading Ghost to 2.8.15 too :: sigh ::
I'm about out of things I can try

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 13:57

your cheat4 is typoed, it has an extra space after the last letter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 14:08

Exception thrown: Read access violation, zfix::getInt()
...which doesn't tell me anywhere near enough context, yay
it probably tried to read an invalid zfix pointer or something

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 14:13

it occurs even if I just stand on the screen invincible in the wall

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 14:33

fuck
I thought I had converted all of those calls....
this very much seems to be my fault

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 14:35

So, there was a rand call that wasn't converted properly
and it was selecting negative heads of the gleeok
which uh
isn't fun for memory access

@ DeletedUser @ FireSeraphim should fix crashes

I recompiled Demo ZX in A97.  Hopefully these bugs are crushed
I also upgraded ffcscript and ghost to as far as they could go to avoid other hassles

=== @ NightmareJames 09/28/2021 16:17

All fixed
