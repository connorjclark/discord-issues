If SCC's are capable of doing this, it would be nice <:VoteYes:888533960810967060> For example, a string that modifies Link's max hp w/o needing to run a script

"negative ID" counters only exist for subscreen hardcoded bullshit
and I don't believe SCCs are capable of negative numbers in general

Right on. I figured it was something like that
The script alternative is stupid simple so it's no biggie
