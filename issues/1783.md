An option for -20 to -27 in the Signpost combo's string field to make it use use ScreenInitD [0]-[7] as the string ID to display

We don`t have access to Screen D registers from ZQuest editor.

that's why he requested InitD
instead of D
(Adding access to screen->D[] simply isn't happening, too much quest file size bloat)
