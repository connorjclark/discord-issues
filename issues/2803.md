the bounded_map::at is ~8% CPU and half of it is from this usecase

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:02

`bounded_map::at`

> if(cont.contains(ind))
>                 return cont[ind];
>             return (cont[ind] = this->default_val);

That's two scans to find the key - this should be using an iterator to reduce it to a single scan.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:04

ah, fair
also, could probably make this change:
...or wait no
what I was about to suggest ruins the point of bounded_map in the first place

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:04

i dont remember what these timers do. But this is classic_1st.zplay, so there are no global switches so why so much work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:05

it should just be doing `if(game->gswitch_timers[q] > 0)` and getting false.... 256 times per frame

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:05

oh, duh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:05

oh, though
since it's a map
it can iterate?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:07

You didn't define anything on your custom container classes to support that.
Assuming you mean std::begin or `for (const x : map)`
(it's a PITA to define iterator classes)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:08

you can `.inner()`
to get the inner map, read-only
....though read-only won't help here, hmm
....could just allow a writable `.inner()`
in which case, this would work:```cpp
void run_gswitch_timers()
{
    bool states[256] = {false};
    auto m = game->gswitch_timers.inner();
    for(auto [k,v] : m)
    {
        if(v > 0)
            if(!--v)
                states[q] = true;
    }
    toggle_gswitches(states, false, tmpscr, tmpscr2);
}```
(I think)
(maybe the structured binding wouldn't work that way.... might not capture a ref?)
(in which case it would need normal `.begin()` and shit)
```cpp
void run_gswitch_timers()
{
    bool states[256] = {false};
    auto m = game->gswitch_timers.mut_inner();
    for(auto it = m.begin(); it != m.end();)
    {
        if(it->second > 0)
            if(!--it->second)
            {
                states[it->first] = true;
                it = m.erase(it);
                continue;
            }
        ++it;
    }
    toggle_gswitches(states, false, tmpscr, tmpscr2);
}```
which should just be that
and just
well actually, you should have to *specify* that you want a mutable iterator
or, mutable inner access, rather
so
`cont_t const& inner() const {return cont;}`, add `cont_t& mut_inner() {return cont;}`
and edit the above...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:11

is all this worth saving NUM_GSWITCHES bytes?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:11

....probably not. Though question is, would it end up being faster when it is using iterators there?
because, it would *immediately* terminate on an empty map, instead of looping 256 times
I threw it on the `gswitch_timers` because I didn't think it would be that costly, if it ends up being not worth it that can surely be reverted

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:13

How many timers are typical to be around? b/c maps are not contiguous so there's also a penalty here in the worst case of all timers being active (vs a c-array). if it's just a handful and having 100s would be rare then I guess it's maybe better overall

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:14

Many quests may not use them at all
and those that do, may likely only use a couple
(do note that for optimization's sake, when a timer hits 0, we should probably call `.erase(key)` on the map, to remove that index entirely so it won't be iterated over in the future)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:17

performant programs sometimes define "small set / vector" containers that keep a small N (~10) things in contiguous memory, and anything beyond that it starts to use the heap. Different compilers will do that too but it is very platform dependent.... I dont think we're there yet but just a thought.
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and edit the above..."): i'll do this üëç

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:18

oh err
my code blocks there have undefined `q` lol
let me fix those

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:19

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "```cpp
void run_gswitch_timer‚Ä¶"): *that* should be correct
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "`cont_t const& inner() const‚Ä¶"): plus this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:21

being able to directly mutably access the inner container is definitely worthwhile
just gotta be careful not to break the semantics of the larger container (i.e. don't insert an element whose key is >= `bounded_map.size()`, which would not be handled by the normal map checking)
and on bounded_vec, gotta be careful not to OOB, since it'll be less than the normally-expected size (but just checking the inner vector's size obviously solves this)
(though no bounded_vec here)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:26

moving on.... this is 9% of cpu üò±

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:28

Similar should work there
That one was the one that needed a damn 512-size initializer before
And now doesn't, because fancy
Or wait

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:30

how is this similar?
Im lost

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:30

This one isn't looping lol
I'm 3:30 am lying in bed needing sleep brain rn lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:30

So this is within item_tile_mod, which you are already on. But it is half of the time item_tile_mod takes up
so I guess I'll ignore for now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:30

...this one is read-only, so, it should just be able to cache the value once instead of reading multiple times?
just like.... `auto ovid = game->OverrideItems[itype]` BEFORE the `if`, and `if(ovid > -2)`?
would halve the searching
err, error
`cont_t mut_inner() {return cont;}`
that's returning a copy, not a ref
also eww spacing while I'm at it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:32

This condition is always false, so no time is spent on that second access. And if that `operator[]` is const the compiler would keep in same register anyhow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:33

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è might be mostly just needing the `item_tile_mod` opt then
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "`bounded_map::at`

> if(cont.‚Ä¶"): plus this fix

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/31/2023 07:34

Yes, I'll look again after that and after the improved ::at change.
But we should consider changing a number of these back if we keep finding insane CPU utilization for 5+% for what was previously 0

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:34

aye
for `OverrideItems[]` I really hate the 512-size initializer
....but, if it's too much of a performance issue
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
the BIGGER ones, this feels like a huge improvement for
(and those are accessed less often, too, for the mostpart)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/31/2023 07:43

(still wrong)
