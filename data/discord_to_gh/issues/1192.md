A system similar to oracle games' minecarts. Combo type would have flags for which directions to connect; at each combo, if there is more than one option, the result would be determined deterministically (no RNG); though without user control (perhaps user control on a flag, to work like raft paths?)

On one hand I want you to kill this piece of crap dead into the ground. On the other I do not envy that task

Incase it isn't obvious, I am scrolling through the script DB filtered by `Creator: Moosh` at the moment XD

=== @ Moosh 11/17/2021 11:23

lol. You got a vendetta against my scripts or something
But yeah I see the reasoning. I target a lot of things that really should be features

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 11:23

You make damn good scripts for complicated ideas that people *want*
or patches for holes missing in the engine
(i.e. scrollingDraws)
so, perfect list to skim ideas from for new features
and if I can fucking make bottles work I can probably make fucking anything work

=== @ Moosh 11/17/2021 11:25

Speaking of scrollingDraws hot damn has it been great not having to use that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 11:25

yeeeeeep
but minecarts frankly shouldn't be that bad
the main issue I see, is keeping track of minecart locations
which will have to be a per-level thing like crystal switches with indexes
changing tracks though..... could... actually just *use crystal switches* to manage that as-is

=== @ Moosh 11/17/2021 11:26

Yeahhh no matter what that's gonna be limiting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 11:27

basically it'd need a "minecart dock" combo, which would be indexed
and each index would have a bool state for whether a cart is there or not
riding one would set it false, landing at a new location setting it true
at 32 possible docks, it would take the same memory as switches
so, not really that bad
but not a sneeze either
For junctions you would literally just use crystal switches doing their `affect other layers` thing
to toggle a junction between two different states

=== @ Moosh 11/17/2021 11:29

Explaining the setup of these things sounds like it'd be trickier than just getting it working

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 11:29

well, the carts themselves would work fairly basically
and with a flag to allow you to choose direction if you hit a combo with more than 2 directions set, it would work like a faster raft
You could also just as easily use a script for junctions still
or have them toggle with secrets
but, tiered secrets don't save
....unless I manage to figure out a sane way for #1193

=== @ Moosh 11/17/2021 11:30

Also to get hypothetical max use out of the feature, would you need to have 64 unique combos in the quest?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 11:30

err
You'd need all 4 variations of elbow joint
both variations of straight

=== @ Moosh 11/17/2021 11:31

One for each dock with and without a cart I mean

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 11:31

one for each dock, aye
but not with/without

=== @ Moosh 11/17/2021 11:31

that sounds incredibly messy
One of the advantages of the script utilizing FFCs is it was super easy to visualize

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 11:32

you already need to have a cart visual to draw moving
so, that would probably be drawn from a misc sprite
or something like that
(how does the raft even work? does it use the *item tile*?)
but, anyway, these things most certainly can eat up combos
so can switches, the more complex you want to get
but simple setups take less combos
so, depends on the user's intentions
Keep in mind that making these threads doesn't mean `hey I'm gonna do this`, it means `hmm, an idea to keep in mind`
I thought about bottles at least a few hundred times over the years, and it took until inspiration struck a couple days ago for me to have the realization of `OOOHHH, I can do it like THAT`

=== @ Moosh 11/17/2021 11:48

makes sense

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/17/2021 11:49

and even if ideas don't work out now, having them down somewhere for when rewrite comes around will be good
because in rewrite we can literally design whatever with almost no limits
(I marked seed satchel for rewrite because... the premise of the satchel selecting is easy, but scent seeds need enemy code mystery seeds need triggers gale seeds need a menu etc so just... bleh)
