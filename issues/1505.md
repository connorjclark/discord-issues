In ZC 1.90 (not sure if the amulet worked in 1.84 but it couldn't hurt to enable this for those quests too), enemies in rooms flagged with Invisible Enemies did not render/be "cloaked" like they are in later versions. They were fully invisible. I will test soon if their projectiles were visible or not.
