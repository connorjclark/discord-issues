To easily replicate this, with the WIP randomizer build sent to the devs, use the file name SHIRT to get to the randomizer menu, set starting character to all six, then start. L and R will switch characters. In earlier builds (I believe this was functional at least through 109, can confirm it works fine in 107), a brief spin animation plays without any issue. In the newest nightly, ZC seems to lag while displaying this animation. The animation is noticeably choppy, and the framerate drops to about 50. It becomes more noticeable if you mash L/R.

repost from the bestiary lag thread:
```Deedee — Today at 10:31 AM
This (Bestiary Lag), the Character Switching, and Stellar Weapons lagging can all be traced back to the "Destructors call on any object destruction" commit 
It appears that mass deletion of objects causes significant lag
Stellar Weapons are obvious as presumably they're just creating 1 frame hitboxes
the other two might not sound obvious, but bestiaries due to an oversight are an equipment non-gameplay item of a higher level that doesn't keep lower items, causing it to remove 30-ish items from your inventory, and character switching changes your currently owned items
Both of these are important, as changing Link's owned items causes the entire subscreen to be rebuilt, including deleting all of the sprites on the subscreen (which presumably would call the destructors)```
