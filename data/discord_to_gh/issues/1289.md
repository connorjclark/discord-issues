I don't know if this is done, but I think i think we should have the ability to collect more than 8 triforce pieces to have a longer quest especially if the quest was a really good enjoyable one.  There have been times I would enjoy the quest but the end is nearing.

Agreed
I could have sworn I also made a request to have the Triforce Gate room allow you to set a number of triforce pieces that you need. Which would go well with this, and also allows for some places you can go when you've got only part of the triforce but not all of it.

When I made a triforce piece above number 8, the tile becomes invisible until I set it below number 8, then it's visible.

To make this work for triforce rooms, would be easy enough
to make this work for the triforce on the subscreen, would be nearly impossible
...To allow displaying the current triforce count you own on the subscreen, might be doable, but will be painful

proposal: a triforce subscreen object that changes to the next tile when the triforce # in its properties has been obtained
or wait, can't one just display the triforce piece ITEM in the subscreen?

^That I believe would display if you have it in the current dungeon
similarly to map/compass
new subscreen objects are not something I'll be touching

i wonder if there could be an individual triforce piece subscreen object where it displays a set tile (from an attribute) once you have a triforce from the level equal to the object's Level attribute
so for level 1's triforce you'd set an object with the Level property of 1 and its tile set to the left triforce
Level 2, level property is 2 and you pick the right facing triforce tile
