I just came up with an idea and I don't know if it's possible for devs to put in the option to have the sprite and sound effects when the secret combos are triggered.

You could have the secrets make a generic combo appear
that is `automatically triggered` on appearing
and does whatever

Cool, thanks.  It's such a blessing that we have a generic combo that opens up so much possibilities without scripting!

I want a way for combos to be permanently cycled to so it doesn't replay the SFX and sprite decoration on screen re-entry.
