I just downloaded the latest nightly.  I first launched ZQ via z-launch and black window opens and closes in a split second.  I tried launching ZQ in the new zlauncher, it would open up fine, but it tells me any quest was made in a newer version.

yeah I've been working on that
....is it really *any quest*?
that seems weird

=== @ cbailey78 11/30/2022 04:40

Yup, seems to be.  However, when I make a new quest, saved it and reopen it just to see if it would say the same thing, nope.  So It would display that message when I open up a quest made in a previous nightly.

.....huh??

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/30/2022 04:44

can you provide the quest file

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/30/2022 04:45

....no changes have occurred in any builds for 2 months touching the code that handles htis
I do have more recent changes working on this, but I haven't posted them at all

Can't replicate this on two files from a106 and a110

=== @ cbailey78 11/30/2022 04:52

It's saved in the previous nightly.

Not giving me the error

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/30/2022 04:54

@ cbailey78 maybe a corrupt download? Try re-downloading the build?

=== @ cbailey78 11/30/2022 19:48

Yes, I re-downloaded it and still does the same thing.  sometimes, ZQ opens and closes.
