Ok so I noticed the 2.50 quest when played in 2.55 has the whole "hitting a boss makes the normal AND boss hurt sounds" thingy. This is not supposed to happen in Z1 and got corrected for 2.55 by default. However, for playing a 2.50 quest in 2.55, it's supposed to happen and is happening. Works great! 
However, re-saving a 2.50 quest in 2.55, it "fixes" that issue. Is that intentional...?
