does it happen on *latest* 2.55?
because there was a bug that I had fixed

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 19:06

I haven't tested yet no idea
Oh nice
Which one?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2024 19:07

fairies weren't clearing after death

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 19:07

Oooh
And that prevented secrets

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2024 19:07

so any script trying to check for enemies (like the shutter script) would always see an enemy and not open

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/18/2024 19:07

Or triggering the shutters or whatever

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/18/2024 19:09

I played through all of dreams realm on 2.55 and don't recall running into any besides the fairy bug (which I fixed as soon as I ran into)

Love it
