=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 00:59

any scripts or futher info you can provide would be helpful; this did not occur in my testing recently, and is not occurring when I compile now in my scripts, so, no idea what's breaking this specifically....

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:01

It seemingly only broke the active global script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:02

ahk, cool

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:02

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:04

if you can narrow down what functions it is that are giving bad labels, that would probably help too

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:04

The portion of the global script that does function controls the FFC for the bow. The broken portions I've found are autoghost and bomb screen shake

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:05

what the absolute fuck
(is it those functions themselves, or functions that are called inside those functions?)

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:06

Hot rooms are broken
Moosh's Day night Cycle is broken

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:06

(I can dig into it myself obviously, but, the more digging you do for me the less time it'll take me when I have time)

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:06

Overhead ladders are broken too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:06

what do you mean by "are broken", like, not working in the quest, or like removing those gives you less errors?

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:06

They literally are nonfunctional

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:07

well yeah, they ALL will be nonfunctional

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:07

It's as if they weren't imported at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:07

the global script compiled corrupted
it will be entirely broken
that's not a question
nothing in ZC matters here AT ALL

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:07

That's strange because the portion that calls the bow's FFC is a global script
and THAT works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:07

well, yeah
it depends on where the corruption is
some stuff might work, 99% probably won't
if it works or not, does not matter at all
What I need to know is, what ***when you change something in the script, changes what errors you get***

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:11

I have no idea how to go about that
I'd prefer some help on bugfixing this since I don't want to have to redo the entire Windmill thing I made a few days ago
32 unique conveyors

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:12

(replying to @ Phosphor "I have no idea how to go abou…"): (comment out function calls, see if it changes the errors)
(see if the errors go away completely when certain function calls are commented out)
(see if you can then uncomment some and still have no errors, until you've narrowed it down to only erroring functions)
(...if you don't want to, I can, it'll just take me a while to get around to)

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:13

The parts I'd comment out are near the bottom of the script, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:13

(in the meantime, if you want to keep working on your quest, the answer is to load a backup)
(replying to @ Phosphor "The parts I'd comment out are…"): anything inside your global script that is a function call

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:13

```global script MGSO_Combined```
this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:13

that means `Trace()`, `Waitframe()`, `LinkMovement_Init()`, any functions
and yes

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:14

and what if I get no errors at all?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:15

if you get it to no errors, then anything that ISN'T commented is *safe and not bugged*
and anything commented, is stuff to debug further

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:15

I presume this is specifically with the whistle script being loaded too?
Because I removed it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:16

(if you uncomment it and still no bugs, it's good; if you uncomment it and get bugs, then, you find that function, and comment things *inside it*)
Were you getting the bug even after removing it?

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:16

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:16

then that's fine
doesn't matter
as long as the bug is happening, and you can narrow it down at all, that's helpful

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:16

With it I was getting the errors I posted in the screenshot

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:25

(replying to @ Phosphor "With it I was getting the err…"): so what do you get without it?

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:25

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "so what do you get without it?"): Literally no error at all

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:26

??

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:26

it behaves as if nothing is wrong yet the globals fail to load when ingame

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:26

oh
what the fuck
that's....

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:26

Well everything but the aforementioned one for the bow

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:28

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "that's...."): that's what?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:31

I mean, it's a lot harder to debug
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Were you getting the bug even…"): also I assumed when you said yes to this you meant you were still getting the errors
because, you hadn't mentioned things being broken with no errors yet
which is.....
yeah, I have no idea where to begin on this one, or how to even have you help anymore.
So, yeah, reverting to backup would probably be best for now until this gets sorted @ Phosphor

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:32

Thank god I had Moosh beta test a few days ago
So the only thing I lost was a cave, the windmill, and some shallow water combo fixes
still about 4-5 hours of work down the shitter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:33

(you can probably use import/export to salvage some of that)
(replying to @ Phosphor "Thank god I had Moosh beta te…"): and, always back up before updating to a new nightly at any point, to be safe.

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:34

I do that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:34

for this exact reason

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:34

Apparently I need to also do that when implementing new scripts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:34

oh, that was days ago?
I...
hmm

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:34

He beta tested for me back on Sunday

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:34

and you were in this build?

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:34

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:34

had you recompiled your scripts in this build?

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:34

No

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:35

then that backup might not be far enough back. Try recompiling scripts in it and seeing if they still work.
(I mean, it's far enough back as long as you don't need to edit your scripts until this bug is fixed, I suppose...)

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:35

The last script to be added was on July 9th
Yeah I had a feeling I'd be safe from the bug if I avoided recompiling scripts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:36

I would recommend the first thing you do when entering a new nightly is immediately compile your scripts
(you get any new optimizations that way, and can catch bugs like this and report them *sooner*, before you end up having a bunch of hours of work in a file that's fucked)

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:37

This may be valuable info

This happens when adding or removing the whistle script

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:37

yeah, that makes sense

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:37

That's a checksum, right?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:38

I presume that's when removing it?

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:38

yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:38

the numbers there are opcode counts
so the init script was 216 lines of zasm with the whistle script, and 53 without
....which given that script *literally has an init script in it*, is exactly what I would expect.
(The warning here is relevant; notably, the whistle script relies on a global init, so, it will not work on save files already existing for your quest that update- only fresh saves will get the script working)

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:39

I can send you the full quest file if you need to use it to investigate

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:39

yeah that'll be best

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:39

Would you need all the scripts it calls too?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:40

yep, every last one
this is... gonna be painful
and probably will take a while before I even have the energy for this kind of debugging
just finished wrestling with Windows APIs

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:44

if I missed a file, let me know

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:44

Err
could you... try a ZIP file or something lmao?

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:44

yeah sorry lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:44

also I love that you are including `string.zh` still
....that is a blank file.
(everything that used to be in that in 2.50.2 is in `std.zh` now)

=== @ Phosphor 07/19/2023 01:45

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "also I love that you are incl…"): I mean I started the quest in 2.50.2 lol
I imported it way back then

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/19/2023 01:47

ahh, fair
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 
(meta, MessageType.pins_add) 

=== @ Phosphor 07/21/2023 20:59

Noticed this bug report has no flairs on it yet. My quest development has kinda halted till this issue is fixed since I'm unable to add new scripts to the backup quest without essentially nuking the globals

=== @ Phosphor 07/21/2023 21:12

Also add function label 17487 because that too came up as not found randomly when recompiling without changing anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/21/2023 21:15

The numbers don't mean anything

=== @ Phosphor 07/21/2023 21:22

That is the most confusing statement I've ever heard from a programmer
Are they literally meaningless? Or just virtually meaningless?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/21/2023 22:00

They are labels for functions
so
it's just the order it parses your functions in
if you edit the script at all in the slightest the numbers could become very very different
and there is not a single way for me to *use the numbers to do anything*
it's a bit of info that the parser understands that is basically non-human-readable
so, I'd say virtually meaningless; they are literally just unique ids
it just has a variable that starts at 0 and goes up by 1 for each label required
(which, it's each label, not each function)
(meaning if/else, switch, ternary, etc all add more too)
What the parser does, is converts those unique IDs into line numbers, which are used in the final ZASM
....that error is it going "uhh, this isn't on ANY line I can see, so I have no idea what line number to use!"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/23/2023 04:53

@ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 07/25/2023 07:16

So getting myself up to speed here. This bug happens with any init script, label or otherwise. It happens when calling any user function but also if statements. That about right?
And of course the cause is somewhere in the commit that added the annotations

=== @ Moosh 07/25/2023 13:04

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) Okay I might be totally barking up the wrong tree here, but I think the offending line is here:
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/dcaa46921153369b1dbd3e59a1bd27fcaef70c21#diff-1cd71f97b4fd5727e33b9445df35998015b22f01f0755e7c95adb10e3a229675R688
```op = op->makeClone(false);```
Big sus on this makeClone

=== @ Moosh 07/25/2023 13:06

Because it's not cloning the labels on the opcode and there's otherwise no handling of the label it just gets obliterated at this step. And labels I'm seeing get obliterated are the same as the ones my example script is looking for and not finding

=== @ Moosh 07/25/2023 13:13

Think I'm gonna turn in now that I've made some progress and my head can stop hurting. If it turns out changing that false to a true just fixes it, that'd be grand but I am through looking at this stuff for right now 😛

=== @ Moosh 07/27/2023 07:32

@ Phosphor check the newest nightly, should be fixed

=== @ Phosphor 07/27/2023 12:40

Excellent

=== @ Phosphor 07/27/2023 18:41

Would this also happen to fix the broken quest file associated with the bug? Or is it toast?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/27/2023 18:41

you'd need to recompile for sure
but I would think it would be fine after a recompile
(unlike the subscreen changes I'm working on, which are absolutely nuking my test quests lol)

=== @ Phosphor 07/27/2023 20:30

Thank god

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 17:09

@ Phosphor have you tested this?

=== @ Phosphor 07/29/2023 17:38

Not yet because I haven't been online all day
I will asap

=== @ Phosphor 07/29/2023 18:25

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Phosphor have yo…"): Can confirm it's fixed and all global scripts that were broken by the bug are functioning again

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 18:39

*wonderful*, great to be able to close some of these parser reports lmao these are a nightmare

=== @ Phosphor 07/29/2023 18:59

Mind briefly explaining what was wrong in layman's terms? I'm curious what the problem was.

=== @ Moosh 07/29/2023 19:22

There were two problems. Firstly, Emily's init script feature was copying scripts's ZASM output and appending it on the end of another script, but some data was being discarded. This broke anything that used a jump to another line in the ZASM (so if statements, functions)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 19:23

^only inside the init scripts themselves
so that didn't break anything but the init scripts
(the other problem was what caused the other issues)

=== @ Moosh 07/29/2023 19:27

Second one was a little more confusing for me. Basically at the start of a script it pushes all of its run function's variables to the stack, one of which being the this pointer. Global scripts don't have a this pointer, so this was causing the size of the stack to be different from the expected size. And that caused things to get screwy.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 19:27

Fun question is why that was a new issue and what caused it to be a new issue

=== @ Moosh 07/29/2023 19:27

Oh that's easy
A line you removed that was pushing an extra constant to the stack for every script was accidentally fixing the issue

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 19:29

oh fucking lmao

=== @ Moosh 07/29/2023 19:29

And then init scripts introduced a new issue because they jump at the end of their run instead of quitting

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 19:29

right
(replying to @ Moosh "And then init scripts introdu…"): err, they still quit at the end of their run?

=== @ Moosh 07/29/2023 19:29

I meant the appended scripts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 19:30

oh, err, duh
my brain is like "the init script"
not "the several many multiple init scripts"

=== @ Moosh 07/29/2023 19:32

because yeah, the stack size being wrong was not as noticeable an issue when scripts were quitting after popping off their variables. When there's a jump though, oops, underflow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 19:32

so basically 2 separate issues that compounded

=== @ Moosh 07/29/2023 19:32

At least that's how I understand it. Though I am _almost_ a layman here 🤣

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/29/2023 19:33

(replying to @ Moosh "At least that's how I underst…"): I'm the one who wrote most of this damn parser and how you described that made 100% total sense
give yourself more credit, sir

=== @ Phosphor 07/30/2023 05:16

Something seems to be residually broken with this still? For whatever reason, every global script is functioning again but I neglected to check if the day night script was working
and it isn't
Even if I replace it with the new script, it just fails to load entirely

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/30/2023 05:17

oop @ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 07/30/2023 05:19

oh goodie
well at least I have a test file for that script already made? 😛

=== @ Moosh 07/30/2023 05:23

(replying to @ Phosphor "Something seems to be residua…"): Wait a sec, fails to load as in won't compile or doesn't run?
Did you set the generic script to run on start?

=== @ Phosphor 07/30/2023 05:24

(replying to @ Moosh "Wait a sec, fails to load as…"): everything compiles, it literally just acted as if the global script included everything but the daynight portion

=== @ Moosh 07/30/2023 05:24

Because it's not a global script anymore I'd assume

=== @ Phosphor 07/30/2023 05:25

Well yeah but I mean the old version was that way

=== @ Moosh 07/30/2023 05:25

ah
okay then...

=== @ Phosphor 07/30/2023 05:25

after the parser bugfix and before changing to the newer script

=== @ Phosphor 07/30/2023 05:26

I'm not too familiar with generic scripts yet, so how would one tell it to run at start?

=== @ Moosh 07/30/2023 05:27

Well uh...It's working in my test file
Under the Init Data dialog there's a GenScript tab
Select the script slot with the script and hit Edit
There's a checkbox at the top called "Run from start"

=== @ Phosphor 07/30/2023 05:30

Ah there we go
Still weird that the old script was just broken even after the fix

=== @ Moosh 07/30/2023 05:32

Yeah I'm confused. On my end everything seems fine with the script
I'm sure we'll figure out what it was eventually, assuming it wasn't just a fluke like forgetting to recompile
