Suppose a person needs multiple varieties of hookshots.  One attaches to wood, and another attaches to metal.  Then there's one that attaches to everything and just overrides them all.

This could be possible if the Hookshots performed as individual Item Levels rather than "One higher level includes the lower levels."  

This also merits the equivalent levels in the Switch-Hook.  Maybe one Switch-Hook can affect some combos but not others.

Screenshot preview of what I mean:

This could probably be doable with the dedicated Hookshot combo type, but not the flags

You know, do Switch Hooks respect power requirements in their enemy editor defense thing?
