Okay so first things first, are Z1 enemies allowed to be edited or does it only apply to ZC's new enemies?

=== @ NightmareJames 10/21/2021 20:46

Yes sir
Dowmfall has edited colors

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 20:47

Okay so here's my ideas
A lot of these will probably need to be rescripted enemies unless someone wants to mess with the default ones
Manhandla (L1 and L2): lower shot rate, starts out immobile, lower speed increase/multiplier for every head removed. Could also be vulnerable to fire since it's a plant

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 20:50

Gleeok (L1): Almost perfect but the fiery heads trying to "anti-home" onto Link would be a neat feature. (Yes I know we currently have no scriptless negative homing) It's too easy for them to fly into you with bad RNG and be forced to take a hit from them or their fireball, especially when you lose your sword beam due to it. I might make it vulnerable to fire as well like the Hydra.
Oh and first order of business: modify all "boss" enemies' EWeapon sprites to have a unique sprite to denote their unblockability
Blue Wizzrobes (and all others like them, such as Fire and Mirror): I'd appreciate if their "diagonal flying" was coded to always go away from Link. You can really get dicked over by them flying right into you and again, losing your sword beam.
Wizzrobes might need weakness changes but I'm unsure on the balancing details right now.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 20:52

Anything that can be done now in the enemy editor, is a suggestion for a new default tileset.
Anything that cannot be done now in the enemy editor, is a full feature request.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 20:53

pfft no
i was just planning on having the harder stuff be newly-scripted enemies for the tileset

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 20:53

I'd rather not cram a bunch of scripts into the default tileset

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 20:53

for example the wizzrobe thing might be doable but i'm sure the manhandla thing would be a nightmare

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 20:54

especially given people's experiences with VD; to the point that a version with no scripts was released because the first thing most people did is ripped out the scripts
so, in general, if you want something in the default tileset, it should be non-scripted
(If you want to make your own tileset with whatever scripts to use as a base, you are more than welcome to do so; but not the default)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 20:55

ok but if one of my ideas is "ugh i don't want to add that to guys.cpp" then sorry

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 20:56

(and, I would not be opposed to including a `tilesets` folder with additional tilesets in the default package)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 20:56

good!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/21/2021 20:56

(just, the `File->New` should be fairly clean)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 20:56

so anyways

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 20:57

Ganon: Almost the same, but instead of teleporting around, he starts at a random location (aka the one you see him at when the triforce is held up), and slowly homes in on Link. Once you hit him, he then teleports to another random location (psuedo-random like summoner wizzrobes to not telefrag Link) and it continues
(he's *got* a pattern on the NES version, but it's fairly counterintuitive unless you use a hacked ROM to make him visible, which isn't really good for what's supposed to be an invisible boss is it?)
Okay so that's all the Z1 enemies, now onto the new ZC ones

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 20:59

(If I don't mention one, such as Zol Tribble, it means I like it just fine)
Octorok on Crack: I'm actually pretty fond of it, but the homing should either be decreased or its contact damage decreased. If it manages to physically reach you you're almost certainly a goner

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 21:00

Death Knight: ACK, decrease the damage by a LOT. And it'd be pretty neat to have it have Rope movement so you can bait it into running at you, then you snipe at its sides while it's busy doing that. (Unfortunately Rope-type Walking enemies currently cannot shoot)
Oh, I forgot two Z1 enemies
Peahat: Has a maximum flight time. If it's not settled down when the timer reaches this, it automatically does. No exceptions. A "resting" row of frames would be nice too, so you know you can hit it
Blue Lanmola: Way too crazy fast. No idea how to balance it without nerfing the orange one, though
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Peahat: Has a maximum flight…"): (It might also be neat for Patras to have vulnerable frames too)
Oh and Rocks/Boulders kind of have RNG issues (such as that @#$#@%# Patra 2 with rocks in Armageddon Quest), but I'm struggling to think of a solution
Okay so back to new enemies

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 21:06

Super/Splitting/L3 Darknut: Got a few mutually-exclusive(-ish) ideas here:
1. Has "Zol" splitting properties
2. Has Rope properties, similar to the Death Knight idea
3. Less HP
4. Splits into only 1 Blue Darknut
5. Splits into two RED darknuts
(It might also be cool for splitters' kids to be able to inherit their shieldless status from their parent)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 21:07

Mirror Wizzrobe: Less HP and damage. I recall someone saying that they used to take 3 hits in early 1.92 betas, which sounds good. I think 4 hearts of damage is also more reasonable. Combined with my idea for the Blue Wizzrobes above, you could also get "stunlocked" way less often now as well.
Wind Wizzrobe: Pretty good, but has quite a lot of HP.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 21:09

Bat Wizzrobe: Have quite a few ideas for this guy. Only summons ONE Bat at a time, each Batrobe's Bats die when their parent does (similar to Emily's summoning script), and they'd have less HP too. Or keep the 32 HP but make their Bats themselves less dangerous

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 21:11

Patra 2: Has more weaknesses such as arrows, fire, bombs, and magic since it's just an insect, which might actually transfer to the original two Patras as well. It might also have negative homing (yes I know scriptless enemies don't HAVE negative homing)

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 21:12

Patra 3: Same weaknesses as Patra 2, and also has the new feature of all its inner ring kids fire in unison instead of individually. Decreased fire rate as well if it turns out to be too crazy this way lol
Gohma 3: *maybe* make the shots a bit more spread-out horizontally? Otherwise pretty good
Fire/L2 Gleeok: MUCH decreased fire rate for this thing, as well as its fiery heads having the anti-homing properties of the L1 Gleeok and Patra 2/3s. Also vulnerable to fire like the L1 Gleeok as well, which makes Din's Fire or a buffed Magic Book quite effective. Fight fire with fire

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 21:16

2.5 Enemies
Goriya 3: Change to 16 HP and change its "homing"/undodgeable boomerang to just the ability for it to fire its boomerang diagonally, and always in the closest of the 8 directions where Link is.
Leever 3: Lower speed quite a bit, perhaps HP, and make it immediately pop up, like a Red Leever. Retain the "one on screen at a time" property though, that's good

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 21:19

Fire Octorok/Octorok 3: Do not explode into fire if it is currently shooting.
Bomb Octorok/Octorok 4: Flying Bombs changed into Sluggula-type bombs, such as scripted ones or the ones Mitsukara feature-requested. Unsure whether those weapons should explode when touched or be harmless until exploding

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 21:20

Summoner Wizzrobe: Pretty good, except for the same suggested improvement to Batrobes; the parent summoner's summoned children all die when it does.
Fire Gels: MAKE THE FLAME TRAIL LAST MUCH LESS LONGER PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD (otherwise balanced well)
Ok that should be all of them
Oh yeah, and Boulders (Z3 Rocks) should bounce much higher as in Z3, giving you more time to dodge
Again, I'm really sorry if a lot of this stuff is infeasible without just having to completely remake the enemy as a script, but that's just how I feel

=== @ P-Tux7 10/21/2021 21:24

I'm very excited if this stuff makes it in because it would make "hard" quests like OUCH!'s and James' less frustrating and RNG-dependent, and also give you some more tactical or weapon use options on tough enemies like Manhandlas, Fire Gleeoks, Patra 2/3s, and Death Knights.

=== @ Mitsukara 11/06/2021 18:49

What I did for the fire trails was make them destructible by certain weapons, like the sword and the Somaria blocks
Boulders feel like they fall a bit fast, not just in terms of of height but in terms of speed, yeah
I'm not sure what @ P-Tux7 was suggesting my silly scripts would be helpful for fixing here but all my scripts from LaZPoC and Inverse Looking Glass are available if anyone wants those

=== @ Mitsukara 11/06/2021 18:52

and I'd be open to answering questions if anyone has any
(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Mirror Wizzrobe: Less HP and…"): re: mirror wizzrobe, a really good easy thing to do with them that's more official-Zelda like (Zelda II) is to just make a version in the enemy editor that uses Teleporting instead of Phase movement
not sure what they were thinking (kaizo nonsense) making the only default ones Phase movement

=== @ Mitsukara 11/06/2021 18:54

sidenote, as far as harder things, I do kinda wish there was a built-in way to make a _faster_ teleport, like Carrock in ZII.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 18:55

(replying to @ Mitsukara "I'm not sure what <@!45808918…"): the fire gleeok for one

=== @ Mitsukara 11/06/2021 18:55

ah
That was a very simple FFC script
just checks the number of EW_FIREs onscreen, sets the gleeok's weapon type to none if there's too many, then back to fire if there isn't
"too many" being defined by the FFC argument for ease of use

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 18:56

if i ever get a tileset off the ground i'd appreciate if you could make more of these ideas a reality. does that sound like an okay idea for the future?

=== @ Mitsukara 11/06/2021 18:56

I mean that's a script I already made, it's packaged with my 6th entry
I'm not sure exactly what I'll be around to make new from scratch but I'm happy to share what I have made at the least
let's see...

=== @ Mitsukara 11/06/2021 19:01

```CS
ffc script LimitEWeapons
{
    void run(int WhatWeapon, int MaxWeapons)
    {

    npc Gleeick;
    int FFCForTimer;

        while(true)
        {
            Waitframe();
            {
                for(FFCForTimer = Screen->NumNPCs(); FFCForTimer > 0; --FFCForTimer)
                {
                    Gleeick = Screen->LoadNPC(FFCForTimer);
                    if (!Gleeick->isValid()) continue;
                    {    
                        if (NumEWeaponsOf(WhatWeapon) >= MaxWeapons)
                        {
                            Gleeick->Weapon = 0;
                        }
                        else if (Gleeick->Weapon == 0) Gleeick->Weapon = WhatWeapon;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}```

=== @ Mitsukara 11/06/2021 19:05

I had some other weird variants on enemies in that quest. Moldorms and Lanmolas that got longer as you fought them instead of shorter, Manhandlas with necks that extended as you fought them instead of getting faster, Gleeoks that had flying heads at the start that merged onto the body as you fought (that one screwed up a little if the damage numbers were off and I'm not sure if I ever fully fixed it? It didn't make the game unwinnable though)

=== @ Mitsukara 11/06/2021 19:06

stuff like that

=== @ P-Tux7 11/06/2021 19:16

```Gleeick```
that sums it up

=== @ Mitsukara 11/06/2021 19:36

hehe

=== @ P-Tux7 11/27/2021 03:01

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Death Knight: ACK, decrease t…"): ok so turns out that ropes CAN rapid-fire shoot

i accidentally made the screen one below the start so go down there to see it in action
does 0 damage so you can see it better

=== @ P-Tux7 11/27/2021 03:04

gleeok head and patra anti-homing has successfully been implemented in-engine as well

=== @ P-Tux7 11/27/2021 03:11

to do:
-manhandla "gleeok-like" firing style (picks one head at random) like @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) did for patras, and configurable head loss speed increase attribute
-phasing wizzrobe purposeful anti-diagonal-telefrag flag attribute
-peahat forced rest attribute
ganon: just the entire ganon thread in feature requests
-summoners' children recognize their parent, and can die if their parent does (flag attribute for wizzrobes at least)
-flag attribute for summoners to only spawn X enemies at a time instead of random 1-3
-configurable bounce height (z-axis) for boulders
-lowered breath gleeok fire rate
-new goriya 3 aimed boomerang firing style
-sluggula bomb EWeapon like mitsukara's request
-configurable flame trail death timer (Init Data?)
i know this is a lot so i'm just going to leave this here and if you're interested in implementing one of it ping me and i'll make the relevant thread for it
