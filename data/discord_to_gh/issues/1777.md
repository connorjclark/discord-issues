I do not like the new midi driver at all. there is a noticeable loss in midi quality and being able to choose an alternate midi driver would be ideal. I have coolsoft virtual midisynth installed on the computer I'm currently using and I'm using Florestan Basic GM GS as my soundfont of choice. Taking away the freedom and ability to choose a sound via an external midi driver is a no-no to me

Nothing was removed, its either a bug or windows changed your midi synth. It did that to me for a bit.

Then it probably was just a bug. I closed ZC, launched coolsoft VMS and then launched ZC and it seemed to correct itself
