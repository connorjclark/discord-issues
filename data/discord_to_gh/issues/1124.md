=== @ NightmareJames 10/20/2021 13:58

Another Z1 compatibility issue, put a flag in the Whistle if you play it, it removes temporary sword jinxes.  I can make LoZ videos to verify this

=== @ NightmareJames 10/20/2021 13:59

Not by any means a big priority, but would be nice.  Just putting it out there

=== @ P-Tux7 10/20/2021 15:45

so the way it worked in z1 was that playing the whistle didn't stop the countdown for the temporary jinx
so its not that the whistle was coded to remove the jinx, the jinx timer just expires on its own due to the length of the whistle song

=== @ NightmareJames 10/20/2021 16:14

OFC, but in ZC I think it'd have to be coded that way to be effective, not sure though.  Can @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee)  or @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)  confirm?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 17:57

This is not a property of Z1. It is an artefact of the whistle tune taking longer to play than the jinx timer and should  not be part of the engine.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/24/2021 17:59

thiis 'bug' in NES Z1 is literally caused by the recorder tune taking as long to play (or longer) thN the jinx clk. It is not intended and as long as you use the Z1 recorder melody it should still work in ZC. Otherwise, it can be solved with a one instr itemdata script.

=== @ P-Tux7 10/24/2021 18:10

it doesn't work in zc since iirc the temp. jinx timer is paused while the whistle plays, unlike z1

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/24/2021 20:44

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "it doesn't work in zc since i…"): I don't think this would be a hard thing to fix
under NES compat rules

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 22:58

It wouldn't be hard to fix with a script, either, as Zoria said
```cpp
itemdata script whistle
{
    void run()
    {
        if(Hero->ItemJinx > 0) Hero->ItemJinx = 0;
        if(Hero->SwordJinx > 0) Hero->SwordJinx = 0;
    }
}```

=== @ NightmareJames 10/24/2021 23:36

You sure that will work @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ?
If it is I'll try it out tomorrow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 23:39

....use  item, clear jinx. Very extremely basic script.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/24/2021 23:40

OK, give it a run tomorrow
Let you know how it works

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/24/2021 23:43

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "It wouldn't be hard to fix wi…"): Well, no. What I mean is letting the jinx counter count down while the whistle is being played
AKA the original behavior

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 23:43

Well, this gives the same effect with a basic script

=== @ NightmareJames 10/24/2021 23:45

Doesn't really matter.  As long as the behavior is fixed and the option is available, possibly in std.zh
We can argue that point later
I'm not going to argue semantics, I'm not difficult to work with
Thank you.  🙂

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/24/2021 23:49

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Well, this gives the same eff…"): Yeah, which is good for what NJ wants
It wouldn't change it for longer whistle tunes, but honestly I'm not sure how many people give a shit

=== @ NightmareJames 10/24/2021 23:51

Neither do I, just put it in std.zh for accuracy since it's in the original game IMO.  Quest creators can decide

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/24/2021 23:56

scripts do not go in `std.zh`
they go in the `scripts` folder, separately
having any scripts in std.zh is a *terrible* idea, as that literally FORCES *EVERYONE* to have the script in their script list, at all times.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/24/2021 23:59

Agreed
Anyway, thank you

=== @ NightmareJames 10/25/2021 07:00

Before I go implementing this
Will it leave perm jinxes alone?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/25/2021 07:23

should
that's why it checks `>0` instead of `!=0`

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/25/2021 08:45

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "having any scripts in std.zh…"): Classic.zh exists for simple system extension scripts for Z1/Classic Plus quests.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/25/2021 08:56

Testing now

=== @ NightmareJames 10/25/2021 09:08

```itemdata script whistleSwordJinxRemover
{
    void run()
    {
        if(Hero->SwordJinx > 0) Hero->SwordJinx = 0;
    }
}```
Just fixed it up so it don't remove Item Jinxes
But it works now, you can put it wherever you put all the other utility scripts, it works now @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) and @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) .  TY

Fixed 2nd Quest in 2.55 A 99 Nightly 10/21/2021

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/900382427061559337/902135162987499560/classic_2nd.qst?ex=65e59c57&is=65d32757&hm=60f48e458377cd8af9babd8e65f951b05a65cd9b80c80c4d7704f507c4017b06&
3rd, 4th, and 5th are up to their creators
@ HeroOfFireZC @ DergerSwerson

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 10/25/2021 15:15

I didn't contribute the dungeons of 4th, so this wouldn't affect anything on my end. For the sake of compatibility, this makes sense for the nth quests. Kinda surprised it wasn't noticed until recently (though why would one Whistle while temp jinxed?) Only use case is if a screen contained temp bubbles and a Digdogger.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/25/2021 15:33

I used it in speedruns @ HeroOfFireZC
Before the glitches changed things
It was just almost impossible to implement for a while universally

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 10/25/2021 15:42

Thinking about it more, I suppose having the jinx run out while everything is paused would be useful for normal combat. That said, this script assumes the jinx won't last longer than the length of the Whistle SFX.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 10/25/2021 15:44

For example, this would not make sense in Moosh's 7th, where he sets the SFX to basically "null", and has a script play the SFX (thus making the Whistle appear to no longer pause anything)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/27/2021 11:17

There is an engine way to do this, but also a script rendition if the a ility to read sfx length is implemented,  as planned.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/27/2021 11:19

The only true issue here is Z1 compat/,emul, qnd nonstandard sfx for Z1 emulation are not su]opted at present.
For now, the issue is solved where it matters.
Heck
I wrote a script for this two years ago. IdK why it has now become so critical.

=== @ NightmareJames 10/31/2021 19:26

3rd Quest is undergoing Whistle Testing.  Currently grinding out Rupees for the Arrow.  Going to work

=== @ NightmareJames 10/31/2021 23:36

3rd Quest Whistle Testing confirm has to wait a bit more.  Whistle doesn't look like it's in Lv. 3 and I'm short supplies

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/01/2021 00:38

Yeah, even when I knew where everything was (thanks to an unpassworded version), I still quit before the Whistle in 4.
Better than my first attempt which ended in 2 with basically nothing but the Book.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/01/2021 00:40

i like how they knew how useless the book was
let me guess it wasn't even used to trigger something you couldn't reach with the normal candle

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/01/2021 00:41

Nope, it was just "haha, you get nothing helpful in Level 1"

=== @ P-Tux7 11/01/2021 00:41

(in z1 hacking/zc 1.90 you can do this by putting a tree by the edge of the screen, then putting a tree two combos in front of it so that only magic can hit it, not the candle fire. you need to leave one space in front and a path to that space so link may walk to it once it's burnt of course)

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/01/2021 00:42

I'm trying to recall if you could make Slash a required upgrade in older quests.
I think there was a specific angle for Sword flags.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/01/2021 00:42

sort of in a t-shape with burnable tree on the left, non-burnable on the right, and the path in the middle
most probably you could do that yeah
required sword flag
put it in a diagonal that only the slash could reach

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/01/2021 00:43

I think it only works if it is diagonally below where you can walk.
Due to the half tile upward walking.

=== @ P-Tux7 11/01/2021 00:44

oh true
though you could fix that by making the combo where link stands solid on the top half
so he can't be horizontally level to the sword flag

=== @ NightmareJames 11/01/2021 00:52

OK people, here's your Whistle-fixed 3rd Quest
Enjoy people

=== @ NightmareJames 11/01/2021 00:54

I'll probably do the 4th tomorrow

=== @ NightmareJames 11/01/2021 00:55

@ HeroOfFireZC, I'm going to check my sugars and meds, then we can chat a bit

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 11/01/2021 00:56

I've got nothing new to say at the moment, still bugtesting other quests.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/01/2021 01:03

OK, fair

=== @ NightmareJames 11/01/2021 17:24

I once again have to get to Level 4:  This might take me a bit

=== @ NightmareJames 11/01/2021 17:35

Lv. 1 is done for

=== @ NightmareJames 11/01/2021 18:05

Lv. 2 has come and gone

Quests have been pinned for everyone's convenience, especially @ HeroOfFireZC , @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) , and @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) .  They work in the latest nightly for 2.55

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 09:06

@ DergerSwerson , when you add this (and fix anything else you wish) with your 5th Quest, please post it here so it can be added, unless you want me to install it.  Let me know.  Thank you.

=== @ DergerSwerson 11/02/2021 09:10

I do not have the password to the completed and packaged version. It was changed prior to release, with I suspect good reason. Someone with master access or whatever will have to change it.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 09:12

Another replay (and a long one) in my book

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 09:15

Now I got to do an accuracy check on top of this........
DM me plz

=== @ NightmareJames 11/02/2021 13:12

@ Mitsukara @ Lunaria If the Discord closes for the 6th closes before you get it, you can find the Whistle fix here in the pinned section, if you choose to use it at all.  You may leave the thread after you pick it up and/or decide not to use it

=== @ P-Tux7 11/02/2021 13:46

(the "fix" fyi is that playing the whistle times out temporary jinxes like Z1)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 07:23

@ DeletedUser  I am curious if you had any permission to release modified 3rd, 4th and 5th quests, or if we have we determined that they are AGN property?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 07:25

I don't particularly care what you do here, but you were very touchy about making any bugfixes or alterations to quests > and I am interested to know what has changed or if these are unofficial homebrew hacks.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:12

Talk to @ HeroOfFireZC about the 4th or @ DergerSwerson about the 5th.  3rd's status is still undetermined

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:14

The current plan is to implement the fixes and to retire it as-is, but is subject to change if Alpha comes back as he has granted permission officially to edit U3Q

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:17

My stance still hasn't changed:. The original authors retain control and can only be overridden by council/community vote

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:18

I do  not o je t to the changes. Ai question if we have the right to introduce them.@ DeletedUser

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:19

5th,fine, we have contacted. 3rd and 4th, I have no clue. The original agn topics are broken.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:20

4th we are considering redoing.  You can contact @ HeroOfFireZC and it's up to him if he will allow you access

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:20

4if atn owns them, l is well. If not, then we have legal issues a d need to avoid them
I do not know the best option now  any more than I did when fixing Dodington two or three years ago

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:21

If @<role: War Lord> has any objection he can voice them here
Otherwise, the original owners retain control

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:22

Do we expect ownership and do whatever we want, or respect original content creators and do nothing until we have approval?
It is not a simple decision

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:22

The latter.  According to ZCO's charter, we have to get community approval to override

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:23

Wtf does HeroOfFire have to do with 4th ownership?
Zco?
I am getting too old for this.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:24

1.  HeroOfFire was one of the original creators of the 4th and the only one active
2.  ZCO = Zelda Classic Organization, our group's official name

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:25

He is not listed as the creator of that asset in my records. I THOUGHT IT WAS alphadawg
Or was that 3rd?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:25

AlphaDawg did the 3rd
HeroOfFireZC and QuestWizard did the 4th

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:25

Ah, well
Then he can direct 4th
I said I was going senile

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:26

I wish AlphaDawg was still involved:  Sadly, it's all I can do all things considered

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:27

I said that two years ago but you sort of ignored my deterioration and just patted me on me back...

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:28

When I repeatedly frak up, mix up events or ppl, just saying go on old man may not have been the best idea.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:29

I just don't know what to do about the 3rd's final fate personally
I don't think it should be lost permanently

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:30

Nor do I. I personally would leave it alone until ownership is conclusive and focus instead of. A new assets and qst set
I paid for the assets
I will ruthlessly go after them while I live
If I drop dead I cease caring and you all can go after them

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:31

I think you're right on this one.  Just put the two fixes in and call it a day, post it as final
And put it in the ZC.com/Pure archive and let it live in infamy

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:32

Until that time, th3y are legally my assets and I intend them to be released under a spcific licence
Android kb
And large hands

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:33

I'm just sorry I couldn't find AlphaDawg:  We did everything to hunt him down

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:34

Nobody asked me to find him
Not sure if I could do better

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:34

All his old sites and e-mails besides his tutorial are pretty much defunct

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:35

But nobody asked the defcon maniac
Just as well
Less work for me

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:36

We worked hard on this, even had a few oldbies look, nothing

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:36

Since I was stripped of even basic commitment resources, I abandoned giving a frak and focused on money earning projects.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:37

Which is fair
Sometimes you just got to take care of yourself man

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:37

This is a disaster for y'all as now I am too busy making money to waste extra time to make a fix
🤷

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:38

If anything, this is my cross to bear from 2000
It was my mistakes IRL that gave TSA the opportunity

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:38

If something goes takes more time than it need take I canna allocate time to do it

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:40

Make it simple for me and I *might* do simple stuff that requires little investment
My present investment in ZC is 0.005%
Versus about 35.050% a year ago
Hoping I grow back some hair

I had a full head of hair in 2019

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:42

Just for the unofficial record, if you had a vote for the 3rd, I'm interested how you would've voted for excommunication

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:42

Wot?

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:42

Would you have kept it, or excommunicated it?

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:44

I would have voted that sans eviden e that agn owns it, as I feel they do, tbat the creator owns it. I would have wanted to see the 3rd Colntest threads (404s) and wanted to see the original rules, then .ade a judgement.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:45

Even here where I have no stake and I do not personally care, I have an ethical requirement to rule on the rules of the Contest, the submission, and the content therein.
I ne er .ame arbitrary decisions, nor do I rule on personal bias.
I do not care who you are or what your needs or urgency are: I rule only on the merits.
You saw me rule against you inb our own contest
Despite being your mate, I disagreed and rul3d against  you in favour of someone with whom I share mutual disdain
F3kif tbat does not say that my judgement bias is impartial than you can all frak off

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:49

I can tag you into the archive of the 3rd so you can review what we found so you know everything

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:50

Zco

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:51

If you want to be your own charter, why are you flying an agn flag and creating a rift between me and wl/agn to ensure that op3nzc.orgd functions?
Your new consortiu. Has absolutely no legal authority over a contest from AGN years ago.
You can choose to do what you want, but the legal ownership of those creations is either the content creator or agn,  not some new consortium.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:54

This is equal to making a co.pany. copying MS assets and saying g you ownWin95
You mentioned ZCO above
(replying to @ NightmareJames "The latter.  According to ZCO…"): Here

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:55

Isn't ZC GPL in the first place?  I do not want to get in THIS argument again

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:56

A new group with a new charter can ot simply absorb something to which they have no legal ownership validity
I do not care who owns 3 4 and 5 quests
But to legally own them, you need to have the legal rights to both distribute and to  *modify* them
Ppl ask my opinion on this crud
I can only give a legal opinion
Not my personal opinion

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:58

Then maybe with AlphaDawg gone, excommunicating the 3rd was the right choice
On that
We have the creators of the other two
If you want to go that route

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 08:58

Ppl 2ho know me already know my personal opinion
I may be able to find AlphaDawgn
Nobody asked

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 08:59

I just, don't want to argue.  Even despite everything, I still have some like for you, even after this whole god damn argument
And some respect

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:00

And r/n, I see no reason to waste that tim3

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:00

I know I don't show it much because I'm still working and very, very angry at you for certain things, and the favor is definitely returned

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:01

At least NJ is less frakked now
Idk what you hate me over, tbh
You sent death threats to Aecin and were forgiven

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:02

I guess time does heal all wounds

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:02

Nothing that I ever did even came close to that

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:03

So I have no clue how you balance anything I did or was willing to do/say against the same from you
But I wS never banned for death threats, so clearly I had lines I would never cross

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:04

Well, when you have 5 people tearing into you
You have to stop them somehow

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:04

If you want to judge me, judge yourself first
Surely our do
Treating them is imo not acceptable
I ignored thatd
But only becauseb knew of your issues

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:05

It's not as easy as you think it is to control this
I actually probably do a very good job compared to most
I have made mistakes though

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:07

You in turn burnt m3e like a tthrice used 
Matxh when it gave you some political clout
I will work with you, but our relationship now it entirely professional.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:08

I "don't" have a problem with that

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:09

Given that I saved you from suicide what...twice
.
You probably should care that our involvement has descended to this
But fine

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:11

I never again want to be involved with your personal or political issues. KEEP IT PROFESSIONAL and if qi am not needed,nleave me alone

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:12

I have unblocked you on Discord.  Please let's make this work for everyone's sake

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:12

Enough Zc people are in my will anymore,  so no-one meed care about kissing me arse and tuen praying g for me to drop dead.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:13

I genuinely have nothing 5o discuss  outside this projedt either you due to how I perceived you treating m4.
No need to block or unblock m4

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:14

I know you'll always hate me

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:15

You do not believe in keeping private messages private so I am only willing to discuss things with you In Public servers.

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:16

(replying to @ NightmareJames "I know you'll always hate me"): I will never forget nor forgive you stabbing me like Caesar.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:17

Your eyes are jaded, anyway, not getting into this with you
It'll only cause pain

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:19

You literally went from the man who would stop a bullet to save you to the man who would deny you a thimble of water if you were dying of thirst in a matter of a month.
Sorry. But that is the hard truth

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:21

Don't blame me for that reaction.  But reflect on why this shift occurred

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:22

My eyes are not jaded, but yours are clouded by propaganda and me doing stupid shyte while blackout pissed
I don't care much anymore

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:23

I think you do
Deep down you do

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:23

Not being in charge means having no responsibility  which means having little to no reason to work on this at Ll; then coupled with making it hard to work on it equals NO
(replying to @ NightmareJames "Deep down you do"): No, I genuinely do not.
I expect ppl 5o have a sense of humour and context

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:24

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "No, I genuinely do not."): Then why engage?  If you didn't care you wouldn't engage me
So yes, I'll call you on that

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:25

And when ppl know I am out of my mind I expect them to see stuff as insane and possibly unconscious ramblings
I am not part of your cult
engage  you?
Specific POi?
Give me a specific comme t and a debate point

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:26

Not in a romantic sense, but in a conversation
(internet, how lovely)

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:27

Although. This channel is a bad place to debate this crud
Er4

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:27

We can finish this off in #deleted-channel

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 11/05/2021 09:29

I wouod ko5 become engaged in anything beyond business ot platonic relations to you, unless you were a multi millionaire.  THIS APPLIES TO ANYONE.

=== @ NightmareJames 11/05/2021 09:29

Let's take this to #deleted-channel

=== @ P-Tux7 11/05/2021 15:42

(replying to @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) "I may be able to find AlphaDa…"): i read on this server that you were already asked about the unedited official 3rd quest long ago

=== @ tim 11/05/2021 15:45

doubt but go on

frankly, what does this have to do with whistles killing jinxes?
this thread has gone off-topic far enough
