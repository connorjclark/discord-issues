In the attached quest (password 2double2) DMap 0, which is always the starting one in 1.90 quests, has a continue point of 0x00 when played in ZC 1.90 and opened in ZQuest 1.90. However, when playing and editing it in today's ZQuest, both its compass point and continue point are read as "0xF7", making the quest unplayable. I dunno if that's what it actually is in the quest - maybe it is, and ZC 1.90 just has a sanity check that sets any continue/compass points above 0x7F to 0x00?

This predates the move to git https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blame/736396d650f0c5fade89d7647ea9568056cd9863/src/qst.cpp#L4386-L4390

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 22:28

The qst file has 0 for the continue, and 9 for the xoff.
I guess we could bound the result of the subtraction here to [0,0xff]?
Will address this after the next nightly.

reupload of the file, wtf discord

just making sure that `cont` is no less than zero....

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 03:27

maybe the entire thing here is just needless? anyone know about this ancient relic?

nope, no clue

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 07:48

unrelated, but I loaded 2trouble.qst and it shows the game clock... is that meant to be showing here...

well the qst was saved in 3.0 so I guess i shouldn't read much into it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 07:50

but also that means the qst is not presenting the bug here.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 07:52

oh yea, should get it from the original source https://www.zeldaclassic.com/resource-listing/entry/57/

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 07:55

well, hopefully this fix doesn't break any other old quests.
