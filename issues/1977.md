Since cycling is made redundant by timer triggers, and the trigger page is OP, the Cycle preview box in the main editor should also preview what combo it become after being triggered (if anything is assigned in combo/cset change AND no cycle selected)

Is Preview mode useful for this?  Put the combo down, hit "x" then "c" and see what if it's to your liking in real time.
This is probably a really bad response though.  D:
I don't even know if that timer thing counts as a secret or not.

Not preview mode, I mean the little combo cycle preview box in the top right corner above the three combo lists

....but, why?

Convenience, laziness, will tell you if you even have you combo/cset change setup as you want it. Just an extra tool I suppose
