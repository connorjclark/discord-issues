There are three arrays or up to ten extra specal items on mapscreens. One contains the item ID (should t to -1) and the other two are or x and y coods. The latter two should both nit to -32767
Even if there is no engine implementation this is very useful for scripts such as extra chests, &c.

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) was thinking about stuff like this, so if there are already arrays to work with, that could be useful
