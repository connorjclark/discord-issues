When a Walking Enemy halts (stops between bursts of movement), I don't think it's been possible to check exactly when they were stopped via zscript.

Obviously, there'd be a lot of uses for this- a vanilla NPCT_WALK tends to fire weapons when halted, for one thing, so it'd be good to be able to check that. Also if you could check this, you could also do neat things like changing their defenses (a la Eyegore from LTTP being vulnerable only while moving), and you could check it to know when to draw something on the enemy while they're hatled, (like the turning heads on LTTP guards), or you could use it to make some sort of teleporting walking enemy that gets moved only when it halts, etc.

So if there isn't already a way to check this via zscript in 2.55, that'd be neat.

Make sure to check zscript_additions.txt
