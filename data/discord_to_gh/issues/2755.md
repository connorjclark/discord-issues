Would it be possible to be able to add arguments to \136 (instead of being limited to the fixed arguments in Init Data), just like you can for subscreen widgets?

the problem is that SCCs can't have a variable number of parameters
so you would need to specify all 8 initD every single time, even if you don't need them

I see. That is a bit messy and would take up a lot of space in your string every time you’d want to call a script, unless SCC’s were made to take variable parameters

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/16/2023 16:11

sccs *can't* be made to take variable parameters
fundamental to how they work

=== @ ChefBear 10/16/2023 16:12

Gotcha

=== @ ChefBear 10/16/2023 16:14

The only other thing I can think of is to have two scc’s for running generic scripts, one w fixed params one w custom ones, but idk if that’s desired by anyone but me hehe

=== @ ChefBear 10/16/2023 16:16

It’s not essential to what I’m doing. My alternative is to call moosh’s dialogue script to run a script which does allow for a variable number of parameters, so if this feature isn’t added it’s not the end for me 👍

=== @ ChefBear 10/16/2023 16:33

Either that or I should be able to use an ffc/screen script to set variables which are checked by the generic script as “parameters”

=== @ ChefBear 10/16/2023 19:42

Or another option for a solution is to have a button on the run frozen script scc interface that toggles b/w two different scc’s, one w initdata args and one w custom args
That’s the cleanest thing I can think of
