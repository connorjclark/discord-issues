Right in the title. I think this would be helpful for picking colors for strings! 

Or even better, a way to click the color and for the strong control code to be put automatically in?

The string editor is already a bit cramped
....do keep in mind that `Insert SCC` is a button, which can let you do just that for a color change SCC.

I didn't even know there was a button for it

I absolutely love the insert SCC GUI setup, It takes all the guesswork out of what \x\x\x does!

Wait where are these options you guys are talking about??

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/21/2023 02:55

....click the `Insert SCC` button?
