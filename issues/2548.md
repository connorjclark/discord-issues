Seems like the second argument in the run function is accessing InitD[0] and the first is accessing some invalid memory.

Can you try finding where it first occured?
You can do it the normal way...just trying random releases...
or if you're brave you can try the bisect script in `scripts/`
(just need to know a good release and a bad a release to start)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/23/2023 05:07

Also this seems like the sort of thing that would have broken many replays if the problem was in the engine so, maybe it's an issue with the compiler?

=== @ Moosh 07/23/2023 05:31

given that it's the single most uncommon script type I don't think it'd come up in replays. Stellar seas despite using a couple screen scripts apparently did not use arguments at all in them. But it does appear they were working then
feeling a bit unwell right now but might try bisect in a bit if better

=== @ Moosh 07/23/2023 07:13

Okay wasn't able to figure out the bisect script, but it's the nightly from the 15th that did it. Emily was suspecting that one so I guess she was right

FYI example usage https://discord.com/channels/876899628556091432/1127417362413518869/1127445424320552981
And I guess you got stuck at the token part

=== @ Moosh 07/23/2023 08:02

Yeah. Couldn't figure out the token

=== @ Moosh 07/23/2023 08:06

oh duh, this is something I'm supposed to create on github itself, isn't it? What perms does it need?

=== @ Moosh 07/23/2023 08:30

okay well got it to work kinda, opened ZC, that's a start

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/23/2023 09:12

I don't recall what is needed for _just_ the downloading of releases butttt

this is all that is needed for anything the scripts i wrote do
(replying to @ Moosh "okay well got it to work kind…"): You can now pass a `-c` as a command to run on each step...to quickly load a specific quest or screen or whatever
`%zc%` gets replaced with the zelda.exe executable
see --help for mroe

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) I found the cause here and I think the solution's super simple but I don't actually "get" the parser so I wanna make sure I'm not making a huge mistake and getting false positives.

It's on this line:
https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/commit/8402c406b1ec47d3981382f0575a1e43d8484324#diff-1cd71f97b4fd5727e33b9445df35998015b22f01f0755e7c95adb10e3a229675R533
```//else addOpcode2(funccode, new OPushImmediate(new LiteralArgument(0)));```

=== @ Moosh 07/24/2023 10:30

From my understanding this part is pushing the this arguments based on script type, but because this in a screen script isn't a pointer to an object, it's just pushing a 0 instead. That was commented out for some reason though and the diff is showing that the comment was added in this commit. So is this just something you figured could be optimized away or did you foresee some consequence I'm not thinking of?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/24/2023 10:49

ahhh I'm dumb
that should be uncommented
I think that's literally it

=== @ Moosh 07/24/2023 10:49

okay cool

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/02/2023 02:58

@ Moosh was this fixed?

=== @ Moosh 08/02/2023 02:59

oh, yes it was
