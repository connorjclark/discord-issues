when the flames are released from Din's Fire, ZC lags. even at the default 32 flames

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:08

this doesn't occur in the previous builds that doesn't use C++17

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:13

This one's happening on Linux, too. I'll see if I can find anything.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:16

It could be something to do with the massive memory allocation/deallocation being slower for some reason
keep in mind that it generates and destroys 32 lweapons per frame
which all have a *full script stack* attached
.....should probably make it so the script stack only allocates the memory if it is going to be used.
.........for all sprite types......
which sounds like a fun adventure
might not be the only issue, though; could be something else at play

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:19

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "keep in mind that it generate…"): that's a funny way to do it

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:20

i thought it just moves the the lweapons just moved away from link until they hit the radius
<:derp:675738486397206578>

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:22

until i saw how slow it ran and you could see them replace themselves in slow motion

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:22

Nope, it generates new ones each frame; that's why they appear to not die on hitting enemies

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:22

i see
that's one way to do it
if that's the case how do things like piercing arrows and beams work?
do they work the same way?
or candle flames for that matter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:27

Those won't pierce an enemy with "Block" defense
Din's, pretty sure would
Given moving the flames and having a hardcoded pierce anything value would be far more sane
But ZC jankify

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:28

uh huh
learning so much today

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:29

Geez.
Callgrind drops from ~13.5 FPS to <0.5.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:29

Fun

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:30

The full animation is like five minutes.

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:30

ouch

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:32

2 things to definitely help this:
- compat QR for old behavior, make new behavior where it moves the flames instead of creating new ones; needs new pierce behavior
- Make memory for script info only be allocated when it is first needed, not on sprite creation. This way unscripted sprites don't need to alloc/dealloc those. A simple `sprite::allocscript()` function to allocate the memory if and only if the pointers are null, and deallocating appropriately in the destructor, would fix this. This should lower lag of all sprite types significantly, including fixing particle effects.
Those are both just general optimizations though
not sure if there's a specific issue with C++17 that should also be corrected here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:34

Adding a general weapon piercing property, which could be script-readwrite, would be useful for the former; `*weapon->Pierce`. Would be `int`, with `0 = no pierce`, `1 = standard pierce`, `2 = pierce even block defense enemies`; 2 being what dins effectively does now

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:36

Looks like it's spending the bulk of its time in `sprite::draw()`.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:36

Oh?
That seems fun
And not what either of my optimizations would target
Does it occur with the compat QR `Old (Faster) sprite draws` enabled?

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:39

Haven't checked that, but I'm betting it does...
Looks like it's mainly `dithercircfill`, called from `doDarkroomCircle`.
`ditherblit`, in particular.
And that's mainly `getpixel`.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:41

Oh fun
Darkroom functions don't have a check to only run in darkrooms
That'd do it
And fire weapons have light radius by default
That's my bad

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:42

oopsie doodle

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:43

And was not in the last build before the C++17 stuff
So that explains the issue
3 fixes, I'll handle them all
... when I wake. G'nite all!

=== @ Guinevere 09/18/2021 04:44

gnite
<:patcat:677072862036885504>

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:44

Yeah, it's a bit late for all that.

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:48

In a quick test of just picking up Din's Fire and using it twice, `getpixel` accounted for ~35% of the program's total run time.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:49

That's used in the dithering functions

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 04:49

Yeah. If there's any way you can cut down on it..

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 04:50

Not really... unless you want to look at optimizing the `drawing.cpp` stuff while having the same visual effect
But, making it only run when it actually is in a dark room will help a lot

=== @ Saffith 09/18/2021 05:17

I see almost no framerate hit by doing this:
```cpp
#include <allegro/internal/aintern.h>
void ditherblit(BITMAP* dest, BITMAP* src, int color, byte dType, byte dArg, int xoffs, int yoffs)
{
    int wid = zc_min(dest->w, src->w);
    int hei = zc_min(dest->h, src->h);
    for(int ty = 0; ty < hei; ++ty)
    {
        uintptr_t addr = bmp_read_line(src, ty);
        for(int tx = 0; tx < wid; ++tx)
        {
            if(bmp_read8(addr+tx) && dithercheck(dType,dArg,tx+xoffs,ty+yoffs,wid,hei))
            {
                putpixel(dest, tx, ty, color);
            }
        }
        bmp_unwrite_line(src);
    }
}
```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 05:18

I don't recognize any of those functions
But if it works smoother, then yes please
Does it respect the clipping rect of the dest?
Wait that's all on the src
So duh the dest code didn't change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 14:33

K
\#3 - saff's fix- is implemented, and works beautifully
also simultaneously made it so none of that shit runs if the screen isn't dark
or new darkrooms aren't enabled

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 14:47

Using `->Explode(2)`, running it a bunch of times per frame, I can cause this:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/888637215637385226/888798434772025424/unknown.png?ex=65ec768b&is=65da018b&hm=b0207b78fd25f68567326acc7d414f5e62be4a292fcebcac1dc09f76e10130b4&)
which, is a solid FREEZE on trying to scroll screens, due to massive memory dealloc
optimization 2 should target this type of lag directly, so time to test that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:07

...well, it doesn't do as much as expected for this particular usecase
and took far more work than expected
but it should in theory be working now
....particles really still need to become a separate class, and not `: public sprite`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:13

. . . wait wtf
So, on optimization `1.` .... I appear to be wrong?
It appears to only generated the flames once, not each frame
. . . I could have sworn I ran into an issue with it generating each frame before . . .

should fix your issues

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:21

ooh better din's fire now?
better as in can be blocked and doesn't spawn every frame

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:22

1. Dark rooms no longer run their drawing code when you aren't in a dark room
2. Dithered drawing is now just faster fps-wise, thanks to Saff's code
3. Sprites no longer generate script data if they aren't using it
Apparently it didn't spawn every frame? And I'm very confused by this?
Or if it is, I don't see any possible way the code that spawns it could be doing that, so

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:22

something i'd appreciate is a way to spawn the ring of fire routine without the actual item

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:23

?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:23

i.e. for a book fire effect, or an enemy making a ring of fire
some way to spawn it with a radius argument

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:23

blehg
far too much work

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:23

no sorry i meant
SCRIPT ONLY

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:24

so a script being able to just spawn a ring of fire?
That's a ridiculously easy thing to do in zscript
```cpp
for(int flamecounter=((-1)*(flamemax/2))+1; flamecounter<=((flamemax/2)+1); flamecounter++)
{
    Lwpns.add(new weapon((zfix)LinkX(),(zfix)LinkY(),(zfix)LinkZ(),wFire,itemsbuf[magicitem].fam_type,itemsbuf[magicitem].power*game->get_hero_dmgmult(),
                         isSideViewGravity() ? (flamecounter<flamemax ? left : right) : 0, magicitem, Link.getUID(), false, 0, 0, 0, itemsbuf[magicitem].family));
    weapon *w = (weapon*)(Lwpns.spr(Lwpns.Count()-1));
    w->step=(itemsbuf[magicitem].misc2/100.0);
    w->angular=true;
    w->angle=(flamecounter*PI/(flamemax/2.0));
}
```
that's the internal code
converting it to ZScript should be relatively easy
the `Lwpns.add` is just a `CreateLWeapon` that sets a bunch of the variables
and the actual ring is done by the `->angular`/`->angle` calcs
so like

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:28

```cpp
void spawnFireRing(int x, int y, int dmg, int stp, int numflames)
{
    for(int flamecounter=((-1)*(numflames/2))+1; flamecounter<=((numflames/2)+1); flamecounter++)
    {
        lweapon weap = Screen->CreateLWeapon(LW_FIRE);
        weap->X = x;
        weap->Y = y;
        weap->Damage = dmg;
        weap->Step = stp;
        weap->Angular = true;
        weap->Angle = ((flamecounter*PI)/(numflames/2));
    }
}```
there you go

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:28

thank you!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:28

that doesn't set some of the vars the internal one does, like the parent item
but you wouldn't want those
oh wait, let me make an ew version

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:29

```cpp
void spawnLWRing(int x, int y, int dmg, int stp, int numweaps, int type)
{
    for(int count=((-1)*(numweaps/2))+1; count<=((numweaps/2)+1); count++)
    {
        lweapon weap = Screen->CreateLWeapon(type);
        weap->X = x;
        weap->Y = y;
        weap->Damage = dmg;
        weap->Step = stp;
        weap->Angular = true;
        weap->Angle = ((count*PI)/(numweaps/2));
    }
}
void spawnEWRing(int x, int y, int dmg, int stp, int numweaps, int type)
{
    for(int count=((-1)*(numweaps/2))+1; count<=((numweaps/2)+1); count++)
    {
        eweapon weap = Screen->CreateEWeapon(type);
        weap->X = x;
        weap->Y = y;
        weap->Damage = dmg;
        weap->Step = stp;
        weap->Angular = true;
        weap->Angle = ((count*PI)/(numweaps/2));
    }
}```
woo there you go, LW and EW version, and I made it take any weapon type

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:30

how does the fire know when to stop moving

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:30

err, it doesn't
stop moving
or if it does, that's hardcoded to fire weapons

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:31

oh well that's fine
i'll test it out with fire and see if it does

=== @ P-Tux7 09/18/2021 16:32

~~time for me to mod it as an npc death effect~~

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/18/2021 16:34

you could also add a `script`/`InitD` param
to assign a script and init values to each weapon
which could be used for stopping them moving after a certain time
or doing any number of other effects
as it's a ZScript function, the number of ways you could simply modify it is endless
