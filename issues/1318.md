(you start in the boss room with a cheat armor ring. kill the top and bottom aquamenti with the reflected fireballs. the middle one SHOULD self-destruct after those two are dead, but it doesn't)

oh maybe the type b quest fucked up because i compiled it in the unselectable ffc script build and then imported it to the fixed build? i'll try again tomorrow...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 06:19

...no
the ffc issue was purely dialog
nothing to do with compiler at all
as related as apples and moon rocks

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 06:20

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "nothing to do with compiler a‚Ä¶"): *of course it wasn't.*

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:13

okay wtf
I recompiled on my end and it stopped doing it
...So, either 2 things: script broke and recompiling fixed it (scary), or std.zh on your end doesn't work
@ P-Tux7 could you send me your entire std.zh folder?

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:16

sure

sorry, is mine outdated?
i recall slotting in a new std_zh folder somewhere that emily posted, but i may have put it in ANOTHER build's folder ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:20

Okay so recompiling with your std still didn't recause the issue
so... wtf.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:23

oh yeah so let me recompile my script file for the type b quest

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:24

if recompiling fixes it... bleugh.

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:24

let's see...

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:27

YES!
thank you so much!
now only for the boss fireball script thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:28

. . .
*screams confusedly into the void*

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 01/05/2022 20:30

@ P-Tux7 what version did you last compile in
if you remember

=== @ P-Tux7 01/05/2022 20:36

no idea sorry
but it worked in the most recent build (emily's ffc script selection fix)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 20:42

Maybe a cosmic ray hit your computer when you last compiled and flipped just the wrong bit?
