There may be some older quests or unknown quests that might use the - Unlock Sound effect which has now been shifted to - Button. I was using sound effect 242 in this case.

As seen in this screen shot, people will now have to go into their old quests just to change that around or now players will have to tap a button just to unlock their Lock blocks now or players might not get through them. This goes for those who may have used Unlock Sound Effects.  - This is in Latest Alpha.

@ SkyLizardGirl huh?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:01

are you sure you didn't have something set wrong in your quest?
I don't see anything wrong here in any other quest file

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:10

(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl "There may be some older quest…"): No those have been the sound effects
before i updated to latest alpha
i have to go through all my lock blocks now to change them.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:11

Was it that that number was in the 4th box from the top before
or was it that the 3rd box from the top was the unlock sound

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:12

I think it used to be the sound effect box
it got changed to button

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:12

....if so, that change would have been over a year ago
the sfx has been the 4th box for a long long time

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:12

Do you know of a quest that uses Lock block sound effects
?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:12

the default `File->New` quest does
and they are still set right in that

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:12

Oh ok
i will look

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:13

so, this issue seems to be only your quest file

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:13

Am going to look
New Default Quest does not use sound effects for locks
If any quests did use sound effect for locks, dozens will have to be changed.

(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl "New Default Quest does not us…"): ^yes it does, these combos

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:15

Are those the new ones?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:15

(replying to @ SkyLizardGirl "If any quests did use sound e…"): no, they won't, because this problem does not exist in any quest but yours

This one

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:15

yeah that doesn't use sounds
look at the other ones

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:15

So if anyone used that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:15

?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:15

stuff has to be fixed.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:15

what are you talking about
that has never had a sound set in the combo

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:16

If anyone used that one i used for Sound effect

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:16

?
what do you mean???

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:16

If Sound effect was added to that lock block
by people in their quests
that means those quests have to be gone through.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:17

????
why?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:17

Because, when you push against a lock block with a different number
it wont function right

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:17

???

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:17

i tested it with the sound effect number i found out it was now on button

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:17

The lock blocks in the default quest that use custom sound numbers are set correctly

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:17

i had to physically undo that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:18

nothing is wrong with these quests

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:18

making Button 0
ok, well, ..
if you just say so.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:18

The bug you are reporting
is only happening
***in YOUR QUEST***

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:18

No its not its in every quest that used the first lock block with a sound effect.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:19

???
How so?

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:19

If any old quests used a sound effect on the first default lock block
it will now be changed to button.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:19

....no, it won't????

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:19

Ok if you say so...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/21/2022 07:20

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ""): ^ ^ ^
nothing is wrong here
maybe your quest file is corrupted

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 11/21/2022 07:20

I will go through some other quests to see
