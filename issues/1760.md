I know combo cycling is a thing, but would also be convenient if `Timer->` (with a box to put in number of frames) were a trigger. Especilly with the new combo effects

hmmm, that's a really good idea
similar to Button it isn't just a checkbox, so not as easy to add as checkboxes
but good idea

Is it time for a Triggers 2 tab? üòù

Can you elaborate what the timer would like, be timing? I'm just curious.
