Will leave this open though, with the idea for change:
- Add an info dialog popup with a `Don't Show This Again` checkbox which pops up when attempting to use these hotkeys while disabled, telling users about this setting.
While this is generally desired/intended behavior, we have gotten enough confusion around it that a popup seems warranted

pushed popup warning, closing report
