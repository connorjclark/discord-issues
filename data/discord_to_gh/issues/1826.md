I go into a quest, change the cheat codes to 1, 2, 3, 4, press the [OK] button to save the changes, and go back into the Cheat dialog and all of the codes are back to what they were beforehand.  Latest Nightly from August 19th or 20th.

Is it the 19th or the 20th? there was one on both of those days
testing in the latest (which, nothing has changed since the 20th build), I cannot replicate this issue
@ Changeling

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 08/21/2022 01:49

The latest one.  I'll try it in a new quest.  Glad it can't be replicated, at least.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 01:50

OH
wait
I just replicated it
bleh

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 08/21/2022 01:50

Neat.  Alrighty then.  Thank you. o.o

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 01:50

So, the issue is purely a dialog one
if you hit OK in the cheat dialog
and then open it again
it does this
but if you hit OK in the cheat dialog
and then close the Quest->Options dialog (with EITHER OK or Cancel), then re-open it, it does NOT do this
wait
no
what the fuck???
ok, this has just changed behavior 3 times
....oh
Were you by chance trying to *CLEAR* the cheat code?
it seems like it only happens when you try to set it to empty

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 08/21/2022 01:52

I removed the ones that were set and replaced them with 1, 2, 3, 4, and hit OK.
Then when I went back in, they were still the old codes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 02:00

I'm legitimately confused, because I *think* I see the issue
....but if it's what I think it is, this has been a bug for almost a year
and *no one* reported it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 02:01

given, it might only occur when changing a code to be shorter than it used to be

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 02:05

I really don't get why Saffith likes using `std::string_view`, it causes nothing but problems

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 02:07

should be fixed for next build

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 08/21/2022 02:12

It's weird, because I do this often, and this is the first time and the first build in which I'm ever seeing it.  <:LinkShrug:943782713788342272>
I'm sorry there's a weird time of it suddenly.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2022 02:32

for the record, this bug has existed for 2 days short of a full year
