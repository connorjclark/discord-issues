When falling into lava or a pit, if the last safe tile occupied was in a cave/item cellar, the player will be sent to screen 80 and is free to explore the entire row of screens.

also today I learned that Layer 1 is stored on row 8?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 04:29

err, no, row 8 is only 8 screens wide
....which means you invalid-memory-overflow into the top left of the next map over

@ Phosphor does this still have the issue?

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Phosphor does th‚Ä¶"): Yes
overflow and everything

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Try this? <@19892296732796518‚Ä¶"): That time around fixed it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 06:21

k, it uh, was the same file, so
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

=== @ Phosphor 09/22/2023 06:21

that's bizarre that it happened earlier

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/22/2023 06:21

something went wrong on either the upload or download the first time

=== @ Phosphor 09/22/2023 06:21

like it just behaved the same after I overwrote zc's exe
