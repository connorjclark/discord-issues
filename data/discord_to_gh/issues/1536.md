I am a weirdo and decided to use the very end of the combo list for title screen stuff. 

Brush width 7 is fine at 65252, but changing it to 8 regardless of order to selecting combo 65252 makes ZQuest immediately crash.

actually I checked and it happens starting at brush width 5, and at combo 65252 (65251 is fine at brush width 5)

Oh, fun
So, if you use the option `Combo Brush`, it actually previews the combos on the screen before you place them
and it has very poor sanity bounding
