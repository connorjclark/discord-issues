To my pleasure there is a proximity limit for Shooter Combos, so thanks for that, however I would like to request an Invert Proximity Req flag for this combo type similar to the Triggers tab. Meaning that if this flag is checked, the player has to be CLOSER than the value in Proximity Limit for the combo to start shooting, and it will stop shooting when the player is further than that distance.

...yes? I thought of how one could use Proximity triggers on combos to cycle through two combos to simulate an inverse proximity-based shooter, but it would not allow for triggering the shooter by such methods as bombs or arrows to "kill" it because its next combo "slot" would already be taken, and thus not available for a destroyed statue combo to be the next combo when triggered. Like a Beamos in OOT.
