Each instruction stores all these things in the qst's script section:

command, arg1, arg2, arg3, pascal-string

Instead, we should look up the command's `args` count to determine how many arg fields to write, and only write a string if the command uses it.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2024 03:40

smart, yeah
probably best to fix the `!TODO ERROR` notes in `zasm_table.cpp` first
(which, unsure what if any compat issues there are with those things)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/05/2024 03:41

Would you like me to query the database scripts and see if any use these commands?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2024 03:50

aye, that would be smart
Some of them are quite old and probably all of them are handwritten-exclusive
and I'm not sure that they even WORK properly
Some of them also have the most minor of things
like the one for npc lined up that's marked? It uses the args correctly in ALMOST every case
...except when the enemy is invalid, then it writes the error value to the wrong register

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/05/2024 05:07

```

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2024 05:09

`LOWERTOUPPER`/`UPPERTOLOWER` were not marked unimplemented
nor was `CONVERTCASE`
or `ATOI`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/05/2024 05:09

i looked anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2024 05:10

those should all be sane and good to go

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/05/2024 05:10

it was near other stuff was of interest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2024 05:10

fair
but yeah, that's a lot of unused junk lol
can probably reclaim those indexes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/05/2024 05:11

I'd just retire them, we aren't hurting for space here.
mark them all DEPRECATED
or DEAD
or whatever

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/05/2024 05:12

heres all the zasm https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wpoY1EUGLckG_vqrXH7dvKRw8qCDlSEa/view?usp=sharing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2024 05:13

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "I'd just retire them, we aren…"): eh, figure it'd be good to save the space in the table
less stuff to loop over if we replace the dead stuff with live stuff

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/05/2024 05:21

if you care about the overhead of that loop we should make a string->command index map

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/05/2024 05:24

but if you care about the speed of compiling/consuming ZASM ... we should stop emitting ZASM as text and then parsing in editor to get binary. seems odd that the compiler isn't emitting binary directly.
would it be a lot of work to change those visitors in the compiler to emit ffscript structs instead of strings

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2024 05:25

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "would it be a lot of work to…"): would require a new function for every opcode

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/05/2024 05:25

looking at ByteCode.cpp ... might be doable with some big find/replace thing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2024 05:25

or rather, a new virtual function on the base class with an override on every opcode
and yeah

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/05/2024 05:25

it's rather structured

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2024 05:25

it is pretty solid lol
note `expand_zscript.py` lol
structured enough that I scripted additions to all of these

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/10/2024 06:45

did my best to record more register side effect stuff:

1. when commands read/write from registers not of their args
2. when reading a register involves reading some D registers too
needed that to do a dead-code elimination pass. finds all the unused writes and deletes em

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/10/2024 06:46

awesome

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/10/2024 06:47

also recorded which commands were "pure", meaning they have no observable side effects ignoing writing to a register specified by an arg
which means, if that register write is not needed, the command could be dropped. but otherwise it is important to keep
surely missed a few there but nbd.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/11/2024 03:11

could probably include these things in the zasm_table
pure could easily be a flag, and could add other used registers in some way
(keeping all the info in one spot helps with remembering to update it all when adding new stuff)
I can probably handle that when I have my PC back
which, btw, good thing I had Geek Squad take a look, because they found that my SSD was dying. So, they're installing a new one and handling the data transfer.
