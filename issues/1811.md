If you have an FFC on a screen set to run on Screen Init, the script is delayed during the opening wipe after loading the quest from the file menu. This means updates to the screen, such as combos or Screen->Item do not occur until the wipe is finished.
This means the combo update will not appear during the wipe, and Screen->Item occurs too late if the Item is already spawned.
The FFC script runs fine after an F6 Continue. Only the opening wipe from loading the quest has this delay.
As this has worked this way since 2.52, this will need a compatibility QR.

Seems like someone ran into an issue and never got around to fixing it.
Easy fix, for the record.
