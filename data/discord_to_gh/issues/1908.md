Add a little text to `?` in item editor

Would it be easy to make the breaking sprites 2x2.

I feel like an object breaking from being yeeted should explode instead of disintegrating/crumbling. 

If bush style particle sprites aren't doable that is

i think misc sprites being resizable is a FR in and of itself

=== @ vlamart 10/25/2022 17:35

Add Thrown to the list of Defenses in the Enemy Editor

Random tidbit I remembered, is there/will there be a way to have the picked up item disappear upon going through a stairs combo or another screen?

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "```

(replying to @ Jared "Random tidbit I remembered, i…"): Now, "Yes", check qrs. (You can just click the `?` button in the item editor for the lift glove to access the two qrs)
(need to wait for the upcoming nightly)\
