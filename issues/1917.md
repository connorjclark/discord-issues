In 2.50 and below, after loading a quest and returning to file select, you could select Quest MIDI Info from the Esc->Misc tab to view midis used for a quest and, unless an option in ZQuest were checked, save a copy of them. This feature doesn't seem to work any more in 2.55. Instead, it only shows the default ZC MIDIs.

Wait, on the *file select*?
I wouldn't have expected that to work after exiting the quest

=== @ Russ 09/24/2022 22:29

Yeah. You can't listen to the music in an area where there's any music playing in the quest
So you have to open the quest, then save or retry back to the file screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2022 22:32

Can you do it on the F6 menu before retrying?
I frankly would expect it still having the info on file select to be a bug in 2.50, as nothing from the quest should still be loaded at all after exiting it.

=== @ Russ 09/24/2022 22:33

Perhaps it is a bug, but it's the only way to actually listen to the midis
And it had worked that way since 2.10 or possibly earlier

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Can you do it on the F6 menu…"): ^

=== @ Russ 09/24/2022 22:33

Yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2022 22:34

Sounds like a solution right there then
I would absolutely expect it staying loaded on file select to be a bug

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/24/2022 23:07

Also, I'm curious if this 'issue' is in 2.53 or not
because realistically, when it loads the title screen, it loads the 'default quest' (the same one from `File->New`), as that's what has the title screen graphics in it
so I would expect that loading to overwrite the midis with the ones from the default quest, every time
so if it was staying only in 2.50.2 but not 2.53, I would suspect it was because of whatever weirdness was in the old default quest

=== @ Russ 09/24/2022 23:38

Works the way it always did in 2.53.1

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2022 05:42

K, so
Marked as closed/denied because I do not believe this to be a bug, but rather an old bug having been fixed.
However
....it took me all of 2 minutes to succeed on my first attempt at making the `Listen` button never grayed out anymore.
Because, like
there's already a thing for pausing a midi and restoring it when you switch out of the window
and similar is used with the `midi_patch_fix`
.....and it uh, just works perfectly for this.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/25/2022 05:48

....err, well
not perfectly in the quest I'm testing apparently
as for some reason half the instruments get quieter after resuming
. . . but, that could just be this particular midi, from this 1.92 quest I randomly grabbed to test
and, the same exact thing happens if I tab out and back in with the windows midi patch on
so, that'd be a separate issue
