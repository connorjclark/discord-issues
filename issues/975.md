so
I'm adding this as a flagset
```cpp

DEFINE UNBLOCK_NONE = 0000b; //Not unblockable
DEFINE UNBLOCK_NORM = 0001b; //Bypasses normal 'block' defenses
DEFINE UNBLOCK_IGNR = 0010b; //Bypasses 'ignore' defenses
DEFINE UNBLOCK_SHLD = 0100b; //Bypasses enemy/hero 'shields'
DEFINE UNBLOCK_REFL = 1000b; //Bypasses hero 'reflect' on shields
DEFINE UNBLOCK_ALL  = 1111b; //All bits set```
should work on lweapons and eweapons

So, `UNBLOCK_NORM` and `UNBLOCK_IGNR` affect enemy defenses; the former affecting `Block` defenses, the latter affecting `Ignore` defenses. These will treat any defenses as though the `Block` or `Ignore` condition does not exist; so `Stun or Block` becomes `Stun`, while `Block` becomes `(None)`.

Neither of those flags affect *shields*. `UNBLOCK_SHLD` prevents enemy or link shields from blocking projectiles; but does not stop link's shield from *reflecting* things.
`UNBLOCK_REFL` will make anything that would normally be reflected instead be blocked by the shield. If both flags are on, it will not be able to be blocked or reflected.

does this interact with the current blockability of some weapons depending on enemy class such as the z1 bosses? (and in gohma/gleeok's case, shot type: breath)

I'll be able to give this some tests once I get back from my current round of work tripping

Had the time to test myself, seems to work perfectly
