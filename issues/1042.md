I've been converting the Demo Quests to 2.55 with the former module thing for mostly preservation (and possibly for the last time), and have been getting a score of conversion bugs (nothing I can't handle, but these quests would possibly play fine without actually converting them).  I want to know how the community feels about this being a possible issue about upgrading quests in the future.  Should we try to make it as accurate as possible, or put the onus on the creator to possibly fix what goes wrong in the conversion?  Discuss.
