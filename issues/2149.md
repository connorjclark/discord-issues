@ Mitsukara
Just playing around with what I can do easily.... how does this look? (font 26)

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1070415674264002620/1070415762549915728/image.png?ex=65e8badd&is=65d645dd&hm=5b553b7dcc884d5022a2b94c015760897d1d6f29b50cb25dbe167b11a3869d41&)
(Here's the current version to compare - font 5)

Then there's some wackier options, like font 37 here:

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2023 18:53

...though that's actually about it for fonts we have that fit nicely for dialogs.

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 02/01/2023 19:10

Ooh, that last one looks super-crisp.  I like it a ton.
I feel like I can read it from almost any distance, even without glasses.

=== @ P-Tux7 02/01/2023 19:30

Thoughts on this font? If you like it I'd be willing to convert it to Allegro format

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Thoughts on this font? If you…"):

That's an example in allegro format.
If you can get me that one, I can test it out

=== @ P-Tux7 02/01/2023 19:33

Thanks! Does it need to be saved in any particular colour depth i.e. 1-bit

match the example I sent as closely as you can
and hopefully it will just work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/01/2023 20:19

OK, so, instead of just giving you larger font options
I instead just give the user the ability to customize the font

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1070415674264002620/1070442718725144659/image.png?ex=65e8d3f8&is=65d65ef8&hm=cb1fe149de97cab52448d49b3ad38e2274b644b56217a62c5e30792dcc13e766&)
So, I've included these defaults:
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1070415674264002620/1070442770239598714/image.png?ex=65e8d404&is=65d65f04&hm=9a21f3c817cdf855e7ff5a07ce8a15b5b77b3ed37f0cc081b9637ff792b28202&)
If you copy any of these out of the defaults folder and into the `customfonts` folder
ZQ will use those as fonts
anything starting with `large_` is for large (non-compact) mode
`compact_` is for compact mode
and `small_` for small mode
Here, `dialog` is used for dialog text
and `title` is the dialog title
(can add more, but, need to handle each thing separately)
the `alternatives` folder just has some alternate fonts that aren't a default
So, if you want a custom dialog text font in large mode, you can just put a `large_dialog.bmp` in the `customfonts` folder of whatever font you like
(where `large_dialog.bmp` in the `customfonts/defaults` folder is the default dialog font for large mode)

Favorite command fonts
Still todo:
1. Font for the layer buttons + map page buttons + draw mode button + main menu
2. Font for above the minimap + next to the combo preview
then after those I need to expand the whole GUI to be a bit taller and wider again to fit more stuff, and work #deleted-channel on a bigger combo pane.

=== @ Mitsukara 02/02/2023 03:23

Sorry for the late response but this is pretty cool

And how about *menus*?
Now, note that that menu is hanging a bit over the screen- still gotta handle integrating the font size into the layout.
but, this should in general work

fits in two drastically different fonts

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/02/2023 05:00

@ Mitsukara so how important are these?
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1070415674264002620/1070569470470406164/image.png?ex=65e94a03&is=65d6d503&hm=1ee89b9f097a3fbc5920dc89c047537c9a5745cba76826a1029654bef6ba9dcf&)
There's already not enough room in compact mode, so I need to make more space *regardless*, but
I just feel like making that font resizable will be painful

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/02/2023 05:07

K, so, with what I just pushed, the Large Mode should mostly be compatible with throwing new fonts at it
The compact mode will still end up shoving some stuff off the bottom of the screen, though; gotta make the window *even bigger* for compact mode to fit right, it seems...
not tonight's problem

=== @ Mitsukara 02/04/2023 19:58

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Mitsukara so how…"): Having those small seems okay- I can't recall using them TOO often, although looking up screen number within ZC can be a little wonky, but since it's listed in hex ("5C" etc) it doesn't even match the number you get if you check the screen number in zscript unless you use some kinda conversion... so I think I wound up not using it too much and doing more convoluted workarounds to check screen numbers anyway XD
Although that said it might be neat if it listed both the hex number and the regular 0-127 number that zscript will tell you
~~it's not a screen number the jedi would tell you~~

which, has been there for like 3-4 years now lol?

Note: The small mode font customization isn't working. Need to look into later.
