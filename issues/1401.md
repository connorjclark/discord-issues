I found a small error where when you go to Test in ZQ, and it prompts you to save, but it keeps bringing you back to the save screen instead of the screen where you pick your location for testing.

You can press test but I think it should bring you to the actual screen, right?

Can confirm. Saving the quest via this window does not actually appear to set whatever flag ZQuest uses to determine if it should display the prompt or not
Cancelling and re-selecting Test seems to fix it

Not an error
this is a function-panel dialog
it, by design, presents you with multiple buttons, most of which run a function without closing the dialog

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:05

Ohhh okay. I kind of thought that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:05

(and, I can construct them with an arbitrary number of buttons, with arbitrary text, running arbitrary functions, so it's very easy to make dialogs with it)
This also occurs in at least one other place....
I think it's the popup when your global init script changes after a compile?

Aye, this is the same underlying code
`Header` shortcuts to `Quest->Options->Header`
and then `OK` closes

... not an error?
Eh?
It seems very clearly an error
Once you've saved, it should no longer be displaying a warning

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:12

Once you've exited the popup, it won't pop back up
but, saving doesn't exit it
it just saves

=== @ Russ 02/18/2022 03:12

Right... but it should
That's how basically every other program out there works

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:13

well, because of the way the gui system works
I can have it close the popup
but it won't go to the test button
you'd have to go back to `Quest->Test`
it either closes the popup or doesn't, it won't trigger a different button

=== @ Russ 02/18/2022 03:14

... there's no way to have it launch the test function after saving?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:14

not cleanly

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:28

Good to know. Nbd imo

=== @ Russ 02/18/2022 03:28

Is it possible for it to open a different dialogue after saving?

Blehg, that was painful, and crashed multiple times getting it working
but there

ooh, grazie

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:37

Will it be included in the next build/nightly build?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/18/2022 03:39

that should never really need to be a question except for major giant rewrites of half the engine
any small fix that's added is *automatically* in the next build

=== @ Jared 02/18/2022 03:43

Good to know 🙂
