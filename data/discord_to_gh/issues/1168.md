The current qst.dat has the following unusual features that do not seem to serve a purpose:
-Two Spinning Tile enemies (Combo and Enemy Sprite)
-Custom 1-20 Item Classes
-Script 1-20 Item Classes

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:28

Oh, and Amulet 2 and Misc. 1/2 items, but I dunno if those have to be there for old quest compatibility

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:28

Script 1-10 itemclasses serve a purpose
they spawn a weapon of LW_SCRIPT# when used

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:28

oh, great idea

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:28

and, custom itemclasses *do* serve a purpose
any itemclass above 255 is reserved for potential new features
...given, all the zz ones below 255 should be the same as the custom ones

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:29

that's what i'm asking

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:29

frankly should just name the ones above 255 `zzReserved#` or something

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:29

why do we have 20 that are named Custom Itemclass instead of zz###

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:29

Because originally all the zz ones were reserved

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:29

i know that assigning an item to a custom itemclass serves a purpose, especially with using Item Override on the subscreen along with it to combine unscripted and scripted items in a single inventory slot
oh mm

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:30

but then some quests decided to use them because they could
so for compat we increased max itemclass and started from the new area
so, frankly, I'm thinking we rename `Custom Itemclass 1-20` to `zz#` classes; and then we rename all the `zz` ones >255 to `zzzReserved#`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:31

yup
```so, frankly, I'm thinking we rename Custom Itemclass 1-20 to zz# classes```
this is what i wanted

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:31

or better yet, make them hidden in the dropdown

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:31

idk. hiding 20 perfectly useful itemclasses is a bit wasteful, yeah?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:31

not the 1-20
the ones >255

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:31

oh good yeah
wait son of a gun they're not hidden are they

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:32

any itemclass >255 will potentially be given engine use

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:32

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "but then some quests decided…"): Did someone forget to hide the non 1-20 itemclasses way back when?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:32

probably

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:32

can't say it's not handy! sorry about the file size thought

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:34

?
It doesn't add any file size

=== @ P-Tux7 11/10/2021 23:34

oh er, the trouble of expanding the array that zc player can refer to

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:35

. . . ?
what's expanding now?
I'm *shrinking* it, now, by hiding the ones >255
So, custom 1-20 are now `zz67`-`zz86`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:42

OK, so now
any itemclass whose name starts with `-` is hidden from dropdowns
and any itemclass which has no default itemclass name will be `-zz###`, thus hidden

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2021 23:59

Oh, also itemclasses have nothing to do with qst.dat for the record
Nor do weapon types or script counters

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 00:00

Enemies/items do

bottoms out at zz255
woo

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 00:53

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "what's expanding now?"): expanding the item class array from 255 in 2.50 to 512 in 2.55

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 00:55

that was done literally years ago

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:29


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908135499250688021/908166415704526868/unknown.png?ex=65e91862&is=65d6a362&hm=c0cc53942bd8df7451053b1029198719e8f1142841b4b5920baadf25077e0d33&)
the init data text now properly reflects the counter names

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:32

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "Oh, and Amulet 2 and Misc. 1/…"): qst.dat is literally only used when you click `File->New`
so, *nothing* in it is needed for *any* compatability

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:33

how does zc know what to do with the enemies?
like, does it have fire wizzrobe stats stored somewhere for when you load a <=2.10 quest?
i thought qst.dat *was* that "model" for everything tbh

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:34

you wanna know what `qst.dat` is?
It's literally a fucking `.qst`

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:34

yeah a .qst

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:35

so, anything from 2.10.... would be in the `.qst` you are loading

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:35

i meant i thought zc read FROM that quest secondarily while playing old quests

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:35

no
it is never read except when you click `File->New`
which loads a copy of the .qst inside

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:35

well how DO old quests know how their enemies and items behave?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:35

qst.cpp
quest loader stuff

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:36

OHH that's the model
thanks

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:36

that's literally the entire point of the quest loader

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:36

i knew it couldn't be in pre-2.5 .qsts themselves...

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:36

and versioning info
so anything is either in the .qst
or it's being version checked

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:36

thank you also ick

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:37

so:
-Amulet 2
-Misc 1/2
-Spinning Tile enemy 2
those are all qst.dat fixes
everything else I just fixed was *not*
also, qst.dat needs an update anyway
(As it's just a .qst, it has any backwards-compat rules enabled for the version it was last saved in, so it needs regular updates to just resave it in new version

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:40

also idk if this should be a vote or what
but should we remove the scripts?
the ghosted dairas at least, since ghost would be prone to getting updates between zc releases

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:42

are they ghosted in classic.zh?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:42

i believe so - timelord put them there specifically as a ghost demo enemy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:42


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908135499250688021/908169785752289280/unknown.png?ex=65e91b85&is=65d6a685&hm=6aa9540cc79b9b095b17fb72d5793d0ed2a0facd29e5eaeba2ee231d0206dfa1&)
nope
they are npc scripts in 2.55

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:42

oh phew

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:42

that was kinda the point
but, I don't want any scripts included in the `File->New` anyway

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 01:43

i was like "we are NOT getting bug reports because someone used the outdated ghost.zh bundled with the default quest template"

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:43

which I had said in the tileset discussion
...guess it's probably time for a `tilesets` folder then, so I can archive the version that has these things

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 01:52

pffft there's still a signpost script in classic.zh
even though we have signpost combos
....and a perm block secrets script, even though that's a QR

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 02:00

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "....and a perm block secrets…"): sorely needed in 2.50/3 to be fair

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 02:22

K, I've removed `Custom Item 1-20`, and all the `classic.zh` enemies and items
and the screen with the classic.zh ffcs
now time to look into amulet 2 and misc items
amulet 2 should be able to be made to do something, now

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/11/2021 02:42

OK, @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) is going to check what the fuck the `Misc 1` / `Misc 2` do and see if they are safe to remove
As for amulet 2, I would like to implement it.... but, uh, see #1169

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:26

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "OK, @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) is…"): the 1.90 changelog says that they literally do nothing and they're meant to be useless
i'll try to track it down tomorrow

=== @ P-Tux7 11/11/2021 08:27

old questmakers often either used them as jokes where you'd obtain/buy a useless item, but they also had a mild practical use in that they could be placed on screens as "fake animated combos" since animated combos didn't exist in 1.90
exate (link to the darkness) used it as a campfire, and princemsc used it for chimney smoke and an animated owl tile
and whoever made triforce of heart used them for animated zora/goron NPCs
since you could (and can) place them on an 8x8 grid like ffcs (though only 1 per screen)
