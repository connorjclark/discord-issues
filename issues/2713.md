I find it strange that link doesn't pain flash or flicker when taking damage in shallow water combos if knockback is not enabled, can we fix this weirdity and make it more consistant

there is no knockback
or should not be

did you check "damage causes hurt anim" on the combo

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/03/2023 20:48

if that flag is causing knockback that's a bug

=== @ FireSeraphim 10/03/2023 21:07

I tested it, false alarm. It doesn't cause knockback
