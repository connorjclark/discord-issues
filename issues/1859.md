@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) The game does not crash if I uncheck the flag, and I can't seem to replicate the bug in a test quest.  The console also does not give any error message.

So if I enable bomb regen for the medium bomb bag as well as the super bomb flag, it also crashes.  But doing the same in a test quest does nothing.  I look at the item QR to see if that might be something and it doesn't appear to be.

Okay I figured it out.  I set the super bombs to bombs ratio to 0 and that caused the crash.

ah, interesting

I wanted to prevent the bomb bag from giving super bombs
thought I guess I should just leave that to the super bomb item

I expected a missing `== 0` check, but it's not missing
...OH.

But it just doesn't care that it's checking that.
I see.

(so, yea, that's just a straight up divide by 0 error. This bug was probably in 2.50.2?)
@ Jigglysaint
should be fixed for next build

@ Jigglysaint can you test this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/19/2022 11:58

=== @ Jigglysaint 09/19/2022 12:01

Sorry.  I did manage to test and the bug does appear to be gone
