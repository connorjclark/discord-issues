The character limit of the DMap Title field within the DMap editor is too restrictive. Because font sizes vary, sine DMap titles could feasibly be much longer and still fit within the subscreen.

Providing some ability to customize the DMap Title field further would help solve this problem. I hope this is feasible to achieve, although I recognize the high potential for this request to be much more complex than I'd expect.

(meta) thread name was changed: Improved DMap Titles

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 22:01

the only way this is happening is if we just let you use a string instead of a normal title
which is complicated

=== @ Russ 07/15/2023 22:07

Is it? Can’t it just check if a string is assigned, then draw the string?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 22:08

. . . is that not what I said?
the dmap intro thing is complicated though, it has its' own timers and clocks and isn't built to use the same system as normal strings

=== @ P-Tux7 07/15/2023 22:12

can those timers be overridden when a string is set? or even completely compat ruled and thrown out otherwise?

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "which is complicated"): ^

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) ". . . is that not what I said?"): No I mean… what’s complicated about it? It sounds very simple

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 23:18

I mean, there's a bunch of tangled spaghetti bullshit

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/08/2023 12:08

(replying to @ Russ "No I mean… what’s complicated…"): the biggest complicated thing is the fact that the dmap editor is still an old GUI and fuck old gui code
(I just considered working on this, then realized I absolutely can't even if I wanted to thanks to moosh's branch touching this dialog...)

=== @ Russ 08/08/2023 12:10

Welp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/08/2023 12:10

if I take the time to upgrade the dmap editor to a new gui, then adding this won't really be that complicated
but the dmap editor isn't a simple upgrade, it requires upgrading new widgets, mostly related to the minimap stuff

bumping this @ Moosh

=== @ Moosh 08/21/2023 02:23

Oh hey, this was on my todo somewhere. I even have the GUI fields made, just disabled. Only thing is it'll require a change to dmap version and I assume a QR too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/21/2023 02:24

thankfully MY branch is no longer a concern for conflicts
