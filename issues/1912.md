Also, Level 3 Link palette (Cset 6) and Whistle => Palette Change (Pond cycling colors before stairs appear) to be unhardcoded as well if at all possible.

Oh, I forgot something - Link's/Hero's death poof
Someone showed me a neat trick they did for their contest quest where they changed all the enemy death animations to be the poof, and made Link's hardcoded death animation to be like the LA collapse.
