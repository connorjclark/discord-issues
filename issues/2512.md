@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) noticing an immediate issue; you snap link's position to the combo but when you move him you don't move the hookshot with him

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 20:51

oop
`HeroClass::setX()`/`HeroClass::setY()` should handle that, did i not use those?
if that's it then using those should work

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 20:52

yeah you didn't use those, so should be easy fix assuming that's the problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 20:52

...also, conveyors work when you're hookshotting?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 20:53

yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/15/2023 20:53

feels like that should be a flag
(they stop pulling you while hookshotting in LTTP, IIRC)

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 07/15/2023 20:53

should be, but I don't have the energy for a feature addition
my mind is bugfixes
and my soul, empty
