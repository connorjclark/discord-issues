I'll probably do it with python
fyi.. I just updated https://github.com/connorjclark/zquest-data to remove the Docker bullshit

> like how someone earlier mentioned making a program to automatically replace a bunch of combos by directly editing the quest file

what other things are you wanting to automate @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) ?

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 05/17/2022 14:46

to be honest, dunno
I mostly figure out that kinda stuff after I start messing with code lmao

I do wonder though, if it's able to convert it to .json, then something like Tiled could be use to edit the data

Not impossible, but def. a whole lot more work than "replace all usages of this combo with that combo" 😛

let me know if you're able to get the python script to even _run_
all instructions needed are in readme

=== @TheBlueTophat (discord: Coolgamer012345) 05/17/2022 23:10

Ill tinker with it tomorrow or so
Moving atm so PC isn't set up
(yet)

Cool, that actually might give me time to learn what the f*** python packages are
They've clearly done tons of work over the last few years to make this better, but it's all pretty complex to me right now
