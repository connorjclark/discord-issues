Newest Nightly; clicking on the bottom half of these doesn't do anything; you need to click near the top for them to activate. Doesn't seem to be the case with the Expand/Compact button and the Alias button.

err, bottom half?
like, a couple pixels at the bottom, or, actually half?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 03/05/2023 23:53

seems to be half

...oh fek
yeah, it does
...it's totally reading the height of the old default font instead of the proper font

It seems like A5 has been opening up a can of worms lately.  The lagging, the click hitboxes and the glitching.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/07/2023 17:03

well yeah, it's a damn work in progress

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/08/2023 22:50

yeah, as I thought, missed changing *EXACTLY ONE* instance of `text_height(font)` to `al_get_font_line_height(a5font)`
