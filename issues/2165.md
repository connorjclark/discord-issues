Oh mine is flashing too in that same area, but mine is on windows 10, it flashes a bit slower though.

=== @ THEMDODO 02/08/2023 23:25

Strange. Probably a drawing issue

=== @ Orithan 02/09/2023 06:44

It's happening to me on Windows too
Regardless of Compact or Large mode.

(meta) thread name was changed: GUI flickering

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/10/2023 05:32

@ DeletedUser @ Orithan is it happening consistently for you, like, you can recreate it to test a fix?
(I can't seem to get it to happen to me)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/10/2023 05:48

@ DeletedUser @ Orithan Try adding this `.exe` to the latest nightly?

That fixes the flickering

=== @ tacochopper 02/10/2023 06:27

Will try shortly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/10/2023 06:50

so what was the problem

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/10/2023 06:51

`refresh` called `update_hw_screen` at the end of it
but you saw at least one spot where refresh *calls itself*....
also, that `update_hw_screen` call wasn't forced

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/10/2023 06:52

ah, and it is recursive
Yeah
Good catch

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/10/2023 06:52

So, I used a static var to make any recursive calls not do the end bit
and then made the update_hw_screen forced at the end
so it should always draw everything, *then* update the screen
Also, just for sanity, I made it so that if the `rCLEAR` flag is set, it does `flags |= rALL`
....I don't think there's anywhere `rCLEAR` is used without `rALL` already, so, it's just a sanity check
that way if you ever clear the screen, it will always refresh the whole UI
...Couldn't replicate the issue myself to test, so I just kinda threw multiple things at the issue to see what fixed it

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/10/2023 06:55

An idea to cut down on dumb extra work

On entering that function, increment a counter. If first time entering clear a "rendered components" bitmask. Remove set bits of "rendered" bitmask from the parameter given. At end reduce that recurse counter
... or just untangle the ugly recursive nature of it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/10/2023 06:55

No, part of the recursion involves draw order
it's messier to untangle than that
I don't want to try fucking with it until I'm removing small mode completely

=== @ tacochopper 02/10/2023 08:42

belatedly dropping in to also say fixed

=== @ THEMDODO 02/10/2023 16:48

(replying to @ Orithan "That fixes the flickering"): Yep i tried the latest nightly and it's been fixed

=== @ NightmareJames 02/11/2023 02:57

Looks much better Emily.  Thank you.
