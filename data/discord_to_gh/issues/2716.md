See image. This should be a drop down of the strings. Also, maybe a button to open the current selection in the string editor.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "See image. This should be a d…"): Attributes can't be, but that's what the `Wizard` button is for
Which should already be set up as you're requesting

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 01:07

Why can't the main UI just be improved though?
This attribute has a "String" label. Isn't that enough to place a better control specific to Strings here?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2023 01:32

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "This attribute has a "String"…"): The label on that attribute changes
If you change the combo type
The actual widget structure, does NOT change

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2023 01:35

(if you would like to redesign it to change that, well, feel free I guess, but, you need to accommodate other situations, like, for shield block/reflect flags the one textfield should actually be a bunch of checkboxes.... which is obviously a lot more complicated than a single field
(but like, that being that complicated... is the entire reason I designed the wizard)
So, in short, I already had this exact thought, and after weeks of work, the Wizard was the best answer I came to to resolve all the related issues cleanly.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/07/2023 02:40

We just need the wizard component to be more visible. The button is too easy to miss.

Either putting it in a more prominent spot, or instead of the attributes showing by default we  use that space for the wizard equivalent, and have the attributes be the thing behind a extra click

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/07/2023 02:41

Whatever you feel is best there, feel free

button is big now

Better yeah
Can we give it a different color
Idk if we use secondary colors anywhere in the UI

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 16:24

we don't have a color for that
we would need to add something new to themes
and somehow populate it smartly on loading any old theme
keeping in mind it might not be POSSIBLE to use a *new color* in some themes, if they already use all 8 colors
sooooo
palette limitations
kinda a problem

=== @ Moosh 10/08/2023 20:33

Could make an inverse color button, just swapping the text and inner colors, like how the dropdown next to it does

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 10/08/2023 20:45

Also what if name it "Shooter Wizard" etc
So it's obvious tied to combo type

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 10/08/2023 21:12

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Also what if name it "Shooter…"): would need to make the button wide enough for every combo type name then
