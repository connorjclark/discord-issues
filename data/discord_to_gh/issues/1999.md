I got a replay of Stellar Seas. The current in-progress build uses a filename to launch the randomizer instead of the base game. The replay file apparently doesn't do this, causing a desync literally from the moment the file is loaded and rendering the replay file useless.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 02:12

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 06:51

Can you DM me the qst?
And what is the randomizer?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 08:46

It sounds like this may be more effort than it's worth. Given the replay feature's purpose is to prevent regressions, the few quests that read/write files could be swapped out for other advanced quests. We can keep this bug open, but I probably won't spend much time on it for awhile.

But please provide a qst file and I'll take a look when I have the time.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 08:52

I'm frankly confused as to what would make it not work

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/04/2022 12:30

I can send it
you access the randomizer by naming yourself SHIRT

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/04/2022 12:37

I'm assuming script reads to the save file name aren't read properly; if I were to guess, the save file name is either not being saved to the replay file (which is weird, cause apparently the filename of the replay *does* use the save file name), or it *is* saving it but it's not reading it correctly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 15:48

It uses the same save name as the Test feature, which is some bogus name unrelated to the original. It could instead use the original, but now the problem becomes "replays shouldn't modify existing files" IIUC

Also if the quest modifies and reads from the file during playing, it would be very wrong when starting a replay.

Note to self, see Russ DMs for ideas how to sync file reads/writes

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 15:49

This isn't the file read/write issue I mentioned
Not related to that
This is the name of the save slot on ZC's file select screen
Oh wait nevermnid I see what you're saying

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 15:51

"uses a filename" just means the save slot name?
and the save slot name is used to read or write a particular file?
(note, there is no problem with ZC.sav being rewritten or anything for replays, that's all fine)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:53

what deedee said was save slot name
what russ was saying is system file i/o

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 15:54

Yeah
Like, system file i/o is gonna be a thing in general

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:54

separate issues, but both issues

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 15:54

But in this particular case
```    void run(){
        int saveName[9];
        Game->GetSaveName(saveName);
        ltou(saveName);
        if(strcmp(saveName, "SHIRT")==0||strcmp(saveName, "SSRAND")==0){
            Waitframes(8);
            Link->Warp(77, 0x08);
            WaitNoAction();
            Quit();
        }
        if(strcmp(saveName, "SKIP")==0){
            G[G_CUTSCENESKIP] = 1;
        }```
This block of code is not working
Game->GetSaveName is not returning as it should
As a result, the replay immediately desyncs

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:55

ah ok
so yeah, that's save file name

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 15:56

That part should be simple, at least.

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 15:57

Once that's fixed, we can take a look at the rest of the replay file to see what else broke horribly
Assuming it wouldn't need the replay to be saved in a new version

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:58

it would

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 15:58

Welp

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/04/2022 15:58

because it won't have saved the save file name the first time
...though connor may be able to manually edit that in

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/04/2022 16:04

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "...though connor may be able…"): Yeah
That's why I made the format a text file

=== @ Russ 11/04/2022 16:04

Alrighty. Lemme know when that's working and we can see how broken things are

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:34

using SHIRT or SSRAND on the qst @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) sent me didn't do anything special.

=== @ Russ 11/05/2022 00:36

Eh? It didn't?
What was the .qst file she sent you called?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:37

starting with `SHIRT` causes me to spawn in front of a house instead of in a cutscene

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:37

Oh, sorry, I had copied over the wrong quest in my downloads.

=== @ Russ 11/05/2022 00:37

It didn't bring you to the randomizer menu, Emily?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:39

SHIRT just worked for me (`StellarSeasRandomizer.qst`)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:39

(replying to @ Russ "It didn't bring you to the ra…"): err, yes, but after the menu

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:41

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "SHIRT just worked for me (`St…"): so I just did a recording, and aye, SHIRT puts me at the house instead of the cutscene.... but on loading the replay, it goes to the cutscene instead.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:41

You're behind, `git pull`. I fixed this first part (save file name in replay), working on next issue.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:42

ah, k

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:54

Issue I'm seeing now is that during original play, the first script rng is used (`script_rnggens[0]`), this is marked as rng 4 (0-3 are assigned to the few non user rngs) . but on replay, for some reason `script_rnggens[1]` is used and it dsyncs (I explicitly exit because the replay step is `R 196 4 4 9587967` but the playback is asking for rng index 5)
This is the rng that is used when I change the value for the "num chars" field
Gotta work out why the script rng assigned is different

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:55

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Issue I'm seeing now is that…"): err, what `0-3 are assigned to the few non user rngs`
what non user rngs
`script_rnggens` is ALL user rngs?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:56

0 is the default
1 is `drunk_rng`
uh... i guess there's just two

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:57

....uhhh

There are `MAX_USER_RNGS` of both of those arrays
and the first one scripts grab should be index 0

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:57

Those are script user rngs, yes.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:57

the "default rng" is not in either of those arrays

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:57

the first couple registered in the replay system via `zc_game_srand` are outside those

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:58

unless you've specifically changed something here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:58

Oh i see the confusion
by "0-3" i mean the indices that the replay system use.
not indicies into that array.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:58

oh
I see

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:58

`static std::vector<zc_randgen *> rngs;`
those
But apparently it's just 0-1
whatever, same issue. script rngs don't get allocated in the same way

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 00:59

. . . .
uhhhhh
I think
there's just a bug

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 00:59

where do they get assigned out?
from this user rngs array

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 01:00


![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037908848071159898/1038256361886187590/image.png?ex=65ebb496&is=65d93f96&hm=3042ac7b4dfb4c8aa2212e47c87ff83cd175abc0c00dc3a15f004e9fc3b34c96&)
....this isn't calling `script_rngs[q].clear()`
so script rngs are not being cleared when a quest exits

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 01:00

oh, cool

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 01:00

and are staying reserved
not a replay bug, just an rng bug that no one caught
at least it's an easy fix XD
(I'll leave it to you)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 01:05

easiest fix so far

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 01:05

yeah lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 01:05

OK, I played up to killing an octorok and it worked.
Gonna push a nightly now, bunch of stuff got in today

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 01:06

bunch of replay fixes, and the melee weapon damage bug fix
and I fixed a typo in a `?` button

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2022 01:06

and the gfx scaling, apparently

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 01:06

aye, and that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/05/2022 01:09

As for actual file IO stuff, that can probably be made its' own thread
and this one closed
