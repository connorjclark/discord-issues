Pols Voice need the movement flag "Can Walk On Liquids" enabled in order to jump over Water combos. This is also a compatibility bug, as they jumped over Water in older versions.
Flag Off - Pols Voice stuck on the platforms.

Flag On - Move like they did in earlier versions.

The flag is off by default, both in new quests and loading older quests.
