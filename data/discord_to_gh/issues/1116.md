**General Plan Outline**

Add immortal flag to lwpns. (Ewpns can wait)
Add ZS lwpn->Immortal to set this flag.
Add a check for the immortal flag to wpn deletion (see my QR for not deleting offscreen wpns), *except*, if a wpn is > 32768, or < -32768 on x/y and the QR is not enabled, then just toggle immortal=false.
Add a wrapper to all actions that set wDead as if(!immortal) deadstate  = wDead

If it would be to match `npc->Immortal`, the immortal state should prevent screen edge death as well

I thin that signed short is practical to prevent roklover but whatever
you want it to wrap back and eat up a sprite when it is that far away you can always ass a rule

once it work you can do w/e you wish
as far as I can see what I outlined should work

Going to be another week or two. Doing day trading now. Shouldstil be easy but I now need to focus on income as I am no longer obligated to work on this and it is many times harder to apply commits that my time expense may as well wait for full implementation  and tests, which to say the least takes 5x longer noe.

Jfyi it will be another week or two.
I am involved in some investments,  and sending stuff to wata to grade
In the space while they are grading my stuff I will have some free time

=== @ZoriaRPG (discord: Timelord) 10/27/2021 11:22

Once they do. I will again have constraints as I s.ell o$ those games,  send more to wata qnd other grading firms, and convert these assets into silver,  gold and crypto
Sorry, but I am preparing for huge inflation issues a d need to think of my ability to eat ere this
But I will eventually get to it if bed on the info that I provided , no-one else does first
