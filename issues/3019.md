Screen 1:57
Is there any reason that this grave should not be pushable? It seems to have the right flag

Do you know this to push in 1.90?
If you loaded this in 2.55 and resaved, I'd check that the combo type is not Generic push somehow (and if it is, it needed the directions specified in the combo editor)

I was able to push it. Did you notice it was a heavy block

=== @ P-Tux7 01/27/2024 20:42

Oh, you mean it needs a Bracelet? I thought I checked the flags
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "If you loaded this in 2.55 an…"): No, I'd never resave it in 2.55 to report a 1.90 bug

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/27/2024 23:29

Yes, need bracelet for heavy push. Is there a bug here?
The combo type was that I think iirc

=== @ P-Tux7 01/28/2024 00:23

Oh, my bad, I thought heavy push was determined by only the combo flag in older versions
