Hero->InstantKill() script command that instantly kills hero without that "last chance frame" period, leaving no chance for things, like bottled fairies.

`Hero->Kill();`
```
void Kill(bool bypass_revive);
 * Kills the player. Their HP will be set to 0, and 'Immortal' will be bypassed.
 * If 'bypass_revive' is true, bottles will not be checked for revival items,
 *     and the normal single frame delay before death that is used for script-revival
 *     will also be skipped.
 * Otherwise, revival processes will occur as normal.```
