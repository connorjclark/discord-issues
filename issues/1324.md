Thread for dicsussion about the new ZScript Documentation project ( https://www.zeldaclassic.com/zscript-docs/ )
@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) @ P-Tux7 adding to thread
figure having a thread for this would be sane
I'm thinking of not documenting `Rand()`, and just handling `RandGen->Rand()` and its' variants, as they are smoother/better anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/05/2022 23:36

updated on site. Bunch of global functions added.
Immediate todo: (string manip functions, and a couple misc ones)```
strcat
strchr
strcspn
strspn
strstr
strrchr
xtoi
xtoa
itoa
convcase
ltou
utol
ilen
atoi
strlen
ArrayCopy
itoacat
strcpy
strnicmp
stricmp
strncmp
strcmp```

Now you can link to either part of a slash in a name
so if a tab is named `Distance / LongDistance`
both `${Distance}` and `${LongDistance}` will link to that page
also, linking now ignores HTML tags in the names (it uses regex to strip them out when searching)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 05:50

Also
if you were to do this:
`Distance / LongDistance ;; dist`
then it would DISPLAY as `Distance / LongDistance`
but links of `${dist}` will work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 05:54

or, a better example of actually using this
would be `Trig Functions ;; Sin / Cos / Tan / ArcSin / ArcCos / ArcTan / RadianSin / RadianCos / RadianTan`
...thinking of making it case-insensitive as well

all valid links

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/06/2022 06:47

also, now linking to a non-terminal tab works
so `${Logging Functions}` links to the tab named `Logging Functions` in `Global`, and goes to where *that leads to*, rather than going *to it*.

ordered lists for constants
good for things where listing all the constants is helpful, like this

code blocks, both single- and multi- line, work. Same format as discord, but no language highlighting.

I finished documenting everything needed for `GlobalTable`
all string manips, array stuff, math stuff, logging stuff, and the other misc stuff

gah finally
made it so none of my CSS can *EVER* affect any objects in like, the nav bar and stuff
(it now only affects objects that are descendants of `.pagecont`, and the `body`/`main`/`header` objects in my file all have that class; so only things within my containers are affected)

If you try linking to a page that does not exist yet, it creates a `dead link`; which will be in red text, not clickable, display the default cursor instead of click pointer, and automatically have a tooltip of `Under Construction!`
also, documenting all of `RandGen` took like 5 minutes

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) I AM A FANCY GOD
so, https://www.zeldaclassic.com/zscript-docs/
this is the page
yes
but now
as you click links to different tabs
you will notice two things
Firstly, there is no more `Back` button that I had before
....but your *BROWSER'S* back/forward buttons now work
Secondly, you'll notice the URL bar updating with each link click....
and, yes, that means I can do things like this:
https://www.zeldaclassic.com/zscript-docs/?jump=messagedata
or https://www.zeldaclassic.com/zscript-docs/?jump=atoi
or https://www.zeldaclassic.com/zscript-docs/?jump=ln

`Audio->` done, OGG stuff omitted of course. Feel free to add it if/when you fix it.

multi-line code block in action

neato

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/08/2022 15:00

also made the spreadsheet stuff a bit cleaner

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/928417830561538068/929389217002455080/unknown.png?ex=65ec79a8&is=65da04a8&hm=de1c6e4a67e5c9cf75467cf0c68e4374050ea485c757f1658728f0926fc71b70&)
so like, you can link using sheet names instead of just numbers
and like, fancy stuff
Definitely want to walk you through some of this at some point so you can get the hang of adding to it
