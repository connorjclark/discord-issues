@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) after pulling your recent changes, my editor looks ENTIRELY different. It seems to be completely ignoring a large number of my configs, and changing the configs ***does not work either, via text file or in editor gui***. Most notably, my font settings are entirely being ignores. The large mode fonts stay changed if I change them in the gui- but, they only stay changed *in the dropdowns in the gui*, and do not visually update at all ever. The compact mode ones don't even stay in the gui.
