Undoing an action with the dungeon carver and performing a new action causes the undone action to return. The only way to clear these mistakes is to entirely delete the screen. This behavior has been present since at least 2.50. Recording taken in 2.55 (Build 61) Nightly (Alpha 113/114)

And of course discord isn't letting me change the post flair

Demonstrating it in the first release build of 2.50

> 2.55 Build 61

What is this? There should be a "nightly" reference in the About menu, that's more helpful.

What is this…"): updated to the exact version listed in the header

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 05/25/2023 22:49

does it list a build date?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/25/2023 22:54

(replying to @ Phosphor "updated to the exact version…"): the `Build` number is 100% useless
you should just use `Etc->About->Copy Report Info`, which copies to your clipboard all the information we need

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "the `Build` number is 100% us…"): Have you considered scrapping it then? Cuz this is where basically everyone looks when asked what build

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/26/2023 00:45

(replying to @ Russ "Have you considered scrapping…"): Correction: It's 100% useless if you are using 2.55. It has use when loading old quests, which is why it has not been removed.
`Copy Report Info` was added so that you literally can just click a button and paste to give all the info we could ever need.
(replying to @ Phosphor "```
ZQuest Creator
Version: 2…"): as shown here, it gives the full version name, github tag, build value, build date, dev signoff, and a hex string containing every single quest rule (which we have a way to quick-load into any quest we like)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/26/2023 00:50

We don't need to _show_ the build number anywhere. That could be safely removed from the About UI and this snippet.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/26/2023 00:51

fair

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 06:26

Not sure how to fix this yet. Bug is b/c `relational_tile_grid` state keeps the old combos around. If you toggle the draw mode after your undo operations, which clears that state, it works as expected.
It could be as simple as clearing `relational_tile_grid` on the undo, but maybe that could break things...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 06:32

Yeah, that breaks dungeon draw mode when continuing (you lose the state). Same as if you toggled draw mode in middle of dungeon carving. I suppose that's already a known limitation.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 07:24

Similar issues as the main one reported here exists w/ Relational
My fix is to simply store the `relational_tile_grid` state as a new command.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 07:34

Fixed for next nightly.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 06/10/2023 07:42

At least for relational drawing... the `relational_tile_grid` state could probably easily be dropped and the same state derived from the combos on the screen, such that when you continue a relational draw operation (after changing draw modes; or editing an existing screen) it would continue to work without needing to start over. Just thinking out loud, not planning on doing that myself.
