Video showing it working originally in 2.10: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZdATqEzHHY&t=974s

The call to `weapon::blocked` ends up deleting the projectile before the frame where it would be able to trigger the secrets. This happens for reflected and regular wand trigger flags.

The person who played the video above may have done it in 2.50 - unsure. https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=67254

They did, that's why the Rope 2s are ugly and yellow because they use CSet 8 instead of 9. That is a still-extant glitch

Oh hey! I remember this bug. I reported it on Zoria's old bug report forum and he never fixed it because I couldn't convince him that it was a bug
