If the quest has very common enemies that can deal 2 or more hearts in damage (32+ HP), sometimes low health warning beep fails to work as it`s hardcoded at 1 heart (16 HP). LttP had low HP warning threshold scaling with number of posessed heart containers. Hoping that quest author can do this for default heart beep.
