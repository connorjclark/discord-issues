I was in the process of saving my quest in ZQ when attempting to reload it in ZC, normall I would get an error with an ok button that when hitting would reattempt to load the quest which would work, as by then the saving in ZQ was done. Now I get that but also this additional dialogue where clicking Close does nothing and the X doesnt act like a button, forcing me to Task Manager out of ZC or re-Test Quest in ZQ

yeah, something was wrong with this...
I think I may have fixed this (or at least worked around it requiring task manager) in my subscreen branch though?

this was fixed

and also new "auto restart" feature helps this use case, check it out in launcher for zplayer settings
