This probably makes the most sense as an optional toggle.

Basically, this is asking for the View Map option, or, more importantly, the Save to File (Mapmaker) to dump a given map to image while respecting each screens set palette, rather than just the palette you're currently viewing.

I'd imagine that it would be hard to do this on the fly in ZQ for general display, but if it was at least possible for map dumps then that would be very nice.
