See title

you need to be more specific with reports
is it just that it doesn't update the volume when you change it?

This from connor seems to imply that would be the specific issue

=== @ BigJoe 08/02/2023 21:42

yeah. it stays full blast

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/02/2023 21:43

but like, if you change the volume, save and exit, does that still work?
i.e. is it a problem only when *you change the volume*, or always?

=== @ BigJoe 08/02/2023 21:45

connor has more specific information. he mentioned that something isnt referenced pertaining to volume. as far as i know it just stays full blast

(replying to @ BigJoe "connor has more specific info…"): so, if there has been discussion about this issue, all of that should either be ***repeated here*** or ***linked to from here***
a 6-word report is not a lot of info lol

i forgot to mention that
