Only problematic when you have a chain sprite with 2 links. I don't remember if I reported this one because I know I reported something similar before.

unhelpful comment but I really enjoy this screen

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2023 06:33

yeah lol, it's neat
helpful comment: force-dir conveyors need to just *not* if the hookshot is out
should be simple-ish?
