Ladder is even more jank than usual lately as of this build. Vertically the ladder behaves as expected, but very rarely does it work horizontally. unfortunately that is all I know, I could not seem to get a more common trigger/

bump

=== @ Phosphor 12/03/2023 16:04

Can also attest

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 05:38

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) could you explain the reasoning behind something in the code?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 05:40

actually wait, hmm

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 05:42

no yeah, might need it explained

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 05:44

?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 05:44

```// If the difference between my and y is small enough
                    if(abs((my)-(int32_t(y+c)))<=(b) && wtrx)
                    {``` in the initial newer hero movement commit, this code is in the ladder checking code
I changed it at some point afterwards

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 05:44

...is that code I wrote or copy/pasted?
doesn't look like my parentheses style

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 05:45

ah, appears to be copypasted
I don't know the logic behind this check

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 05:45

most of `New Hero Movement` is very similar to original, except for things related to step speed
the comment says exactly what it's doing
checking the difference between `my` and `y+c` is `<= b`
....why or any further explaination, I have no clue
the ladder is a clusterfuck

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 05:46

this check appears to be causing the inconsistency
gonna try removing it and observing it's effects

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 05:48

my theory is that it's checking if link is right against the water before placing it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 05:49

...and it's also casting to int, so not using any of the decimal precision

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 05:58

okay so that line is specifically needed because otherwise you will ladder everywhere
gonna try it without the int cast

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 06:00

that did not fix it

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 06:10

keeping the wtrx part of the check and nothing else fixes it
I have no clue what the hell the point of the other part even is; why is it checking for y coords when moving left/right
is it a remnant of 4 way walking stuff?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 06:11

...gridlock stuff?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 06:11

yeah
that's what I'd imagine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 06:11

lol

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 06:14

I removed it for newer hero stuff, but I wonder if removing it for non-new hero movement would be wise
or locking it behind a gridlock check

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 06:20

actually wait I might have a new theory behind the point of it
need to confirm it though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 06:54

okay figured it out
it's a half-baked implementation of allowing corner shoving on solid pits

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/05/2023 06:55

...pffft

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/05/2023 16:24

looking into other ladder stuff, so might be a bit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/07/2023 08:25

The issues seemed to only be with newer hero movement

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/07/2023 08:29

I went and polished up the ladder some with newer hero movement; it should now have corner shoving both on and off the ladder, it'll now deploy the ladder even if you're already most of the way on water, it no longer ladders over solid non-ladderable stuff, and it now obeys an 8x8 grid instead of a 16x16 grid if you have pits or water that are offset by 8 pixels
didn't feel like backporting some of those so a few of them are newer hero movement only (the shoving when getting off of the ladder seemingly seems to already be a feature of older hero movements; maybe I already did it?)
anyways this should be fixed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/07/2023 08:31

just need to wait for replay test to go through

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/14/2023 08:39

Is this fixed?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/14/2023 08:46

meant to flag this as "needs testing", but hopefully!

=== @ Phosphor 12/14/2023 20:00

It seems more consistent to me
I'll need to test further but I haven't drowned when I wanted to ladder once so far

=== @ Deathrider 12/17/2023 16:18

Ohh I will need to test it

=== @ Deathrider 12/18/2023 19:19

I concur, cant replicate the original behavior

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/20/2023 08:00

thanks for checking!

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/20/2023 08:56

woo!
