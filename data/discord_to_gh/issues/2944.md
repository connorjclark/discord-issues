Idk whether to call this a bug or a request but I'm asking for a fix so I'm calling it a bug. Currently, to find a sfx w/ search, you have to put the id number of the sfx, which isn't particularly useful. Better if it would check for the first word or one of the words in the sfx name

yeah, gotta give it the same change as other menus, with the numbers in parens at the end `(001)`

keep in mind that the sfx being in numerical order also makes it a lot more useless to search

Mmmm maybe for some? For me I usually just remember the name or part of the name

well like
imagine that sfx 1 is `Octorok_Hurt`
and sfx 200 is `Octorok_Attack`
you would need to type out all of `Octorok_A` before you get anywhere *NEAR* the right spot
...if it's alphabetical, just `O` will get you pretty immediately next to where you need to be

Mmm
