Not sure if this applies to other quest versions.
Use the cheat "tt" in the included quest by JayeM to see this in action. Give yourself bombs and then use a Super Bomb, you will notice that your NORMAL bomb counter decrements. For what it's worth normal bombs work normally, they also decrement the normal bomb counter.
