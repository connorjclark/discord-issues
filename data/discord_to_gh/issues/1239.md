Options for boomerangs to:

1. Set their deadstate to return (WDS_BOUNCE, I think?) when you push the button

2. Spawn additional boomerangs (up to a set number) when you push the button again. This would probably override the above feature until you've thrown your last available boomerang.

This same deadstate idea could apply to the hookshot, too. (Press the button to make the hookshot stop early)
