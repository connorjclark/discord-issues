1) Config inheritance

Allegro supports config inheritance, and we should utilize that. Introduce a `base.cfg` file that can hold common options, which can be overriden by more specific cfg files. Will involve moving things like `showfps` to a new category (either `base` or the existing `graphics`?)

2) Default values

When a new option is introduced, we must set an initial value to use at runtime (by providing a fallback value when missing) and in the initial `.cfg` file. If a user upgrades an install by moving their old cfg files over, they will get the default-in-code value and that will now be in their cfg file. But if we ever decide to change what "default" means (in code and in the initial `.cfg`), they won't get that change. This makes introducing new features behind a temporary config flag problematic.

To fix this, we need a concept for a `default` value. If an option is set to the string `default`, we should use the code-defined default value. If a newly-added option is missing in a user's config file, it should either _not_ be saved to their cfg, or the value `default` should be saved.

3) Documentation

Ideally, each option in the default `.cfg` files have comment blocks describing what they do. Later, we can parse these default `.cfg` files to create some documentation.

During this process we should audit the existing options and remove what no longer makes sense to keep.

We may be able to define the default values in these comments, and at build time parse these files to generate the runtime default values.

4) Launcher

At build time, parse the default `.cfg` files and their documentation comments, and generate options for use by the launcher.

these would be great improvements

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 02:00

config inheritance would fix issues like having to turn on the same setting for both ZC and ZQuest
though, it might also complicate those a bit? unsure

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 02:01

Alternative to having a `default` string value literally in the cfg files... maybe have `base.cfg` have all the defaults, and change the code to stop writing the "fallback" value to application cfg files somehow...

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 02:01

we'd need to change the launcher to allow you to "clear" a value to default

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 02:02

Yeah, which could be as simple as "delete the cfg key in zquest.cfg" or something
(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Alternative to having a `defa…"): liking this much better than a `default` literal

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 11/10/2022 02:02

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) adding you to this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2022 02:03

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Alternative to having a `defa…"): the writing the fallback values was something I specifically added
so disabling that is dead-easy
that's in our code, in `zc_get_config`

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2022 02:05

`zconfig.h`/`zconfig.cpp`

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 02:06

Was the reasoning there just to give users visibility on all available options?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2022 02:06

yep
to not require people trash their old config files and force them to use the new default config file

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 02:07

nice, yeah that makes sense. I think the `base.cfg` could provide the same purpose, then later some nice generated docs could be even better.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2022 02:07

...which, your ideas here seem to handle pretty well
yeah exactly
so this'd just be an upgrade on that system
also, for the record
`set_config_string` setting something to `""` deletes the key from the config file
```cpp
char const* zc_get_config(char const* header, char const* name, char const* default_val)
{
    char const* ret = get_config_string(header,name,default_val);
    if(ret==default_val) //Defaulted, so write it back
    {
        if (!default_val)
            set_config_string(header, name, "");
        else if(default_val[0]) //Writing back the empty string destroys the value?? -Em
            set_config_string(header, name, default_val);
    }
    if(!ret)
        cfg_str[0] = 0;
    else strcpy(cfg_str, ret);
    return cfg_str;
}```
the comment in the middle there pointing that out, as I had to work around that for my purposes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/10/2022 02:19

Should we also move away from each executable having its own `.cfg`, and instead do just one file (`ag.cfg` does this but I'm not sure anyone uses it):

```
[zquest]
showfps=1

[zelda]
whatever=1
```

And possibly move `[graphics]`, `[Theme]`, etc options to these, and just keep categories to application names.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/10/2022 02:20

I think the problem with this
is what happens when you close an exe
...as long as they are separate, it works
but if you have any shared config used by both exes, you have a problem
because imagine, ex, you have `someconfig = 1` which is shared by zc and zq
you have zc and zq both open
in zq, you go to options, and change the value to `2`
you close zq, this writes `someconfig = 2` to the config file
...you then close zc, this writes `someconfig = 1` to the config file.
To do it as 2 separate headers shouldn't have that problem though

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/01/2022 11:12

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Should we also move away from…"): we did this before with ag.cfg; not sure why we split into multiple files

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/01/2022 11:13

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I think the problem with this"): ^

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/01/2022 11:13

ohh, right, yeah

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 11:49

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Alternative to having a `defa…"): Just finished some major work on this
just waiting for ci before merging
now there's a `base_config` folder, holding the default `zc.cfg`/`zquest.cfg`/etc
and reads will use the base value as a default when checking the normal config

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 11:52

The hard part had nothing to do with actually getting it to use a base config as defaults
the hard part was refactoring all the shit being written out to the config file all the time, to only write when a value is actually modified
I *attempted* to comment some things, but mostly ran out of energy on that

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2022 11:58

some of the functions are called basic, should they instead be base?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 11:58

no, those are for things that don't use the base system
like module files and theme files, which also use the config get system
they WERE using `zc_get_config` before, but, they don't want to anymore
The `_basic` ones don't `set_config_file`
the non-basic ones do

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2022 12:21

Mostly get it, not sure why I'm up so late but I'll look more tomorrow.

Two questions I have rn:

Can we drop the defaults in the zc_get_config functions too, or do they serve a purpose?

Does pushing/popping these configs cause allegro to do any significant work (like reading from disk or re parsing)?
I'll verify/fix web version stuff tomorrow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 12:23

1. incase someone deletes the base configs
2. Almost certainly yes
whatever optimizations you can manage, feel free
though writing out the config file on each config change is an intentional note, as that means even if a crash occurs the config file will have been flushed to disk
For ZQ I figure it can't hurt that much frame wise
and for ZC I don't think configs really run during game time, they cache to global vars first
`4704 FPS` in 1st.qst

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 12:28

...which is still over twice what I got pre render refactor, damn

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2022 12:29

Great to remove the manual "save config" prompt that thing sucked
I manually saved the config on every change for web version to workaround that

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 12:32

...apparently I only removed it from zq
oop

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2022 12:38

Allegro 5 does support config inheritance so I'll likely refactor to use that later, should prevent extraneous work

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 12:39

aye, noticed you said something about that, didn't feel like taking the time to look at it.
(Figured it was better to get all the other shit done here)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/04/2022 12:40

It's used barely in Zelda and zquest IIRC right now
somewhere in main entry
allegro.cfg

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/04/2022 12:44

I'd guess it'll be a handful of lines in zconfig.cpp for that change, probably?
glad I actually took the time to organize config stuff back whenever it was that I made zconfig.cpp/.h
made it a lot easier now
