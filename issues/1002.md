Was told to report this.  I have indeed checked my settings.  Every time I die or run out, this will indeed reset again and play.  This definitely needs to be fixed.  Providing screen proof to show I do not have held or always checked off on bombs.  Will provide videos later if needed
My proof that nothing's checked off but the string being displayed.

Does Pick-Up Flags have something to do with it maybe? Also why's that check box hueg big?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 23:29

... that's not a checkbox

=== @ Moosh 09/08/2021 23:29

Also you already made a report for this didn't you?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 23:29

No he made a feature req

That sure looks like a check box?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 23:29

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) you didn't remove the old pickupflags box
WTF
That used to be a textfield
And it's outdated by the new tab of checkboxes

=== @ Moosh 09/08/2021 23:30

strange

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 23:30

Dimi forgot to remove it... and apparently converted it to a checkbox?
Shouldn't be related

=== @ Moosh 09/08/2021 23:31

Dare I ask what happens if you check that and save?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 23:31

Probably nothing?
Hopefully nothing?

=== @ Moosh 09/08/2021 23:32

Anyways, the behavior Nightmare's been having difficulty with is that every time the player dies, the bit flagging the string as having played gets reset

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/08/2021 23:32

Yeah, that's certainly a bug

=== @ Moosh 09/08/2021 23:33

I could see it being an intended behavior depending on the quest
Like if pickup strings only go on non enemy drops, you might want them to refresh on a new play session
but a script can just as easily do that

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/08/2021 23:35

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) you did‚Ä¶"): ...fuck

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/08/2021 23:37

I don't know how the hell it got turned into a check_proc. Did I sleepwalk to get both high and drunk and then wrote that while sleeping, drunk, and high?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/28/2021 15:10

the gui part of this was fixed

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 10/09/2021 16:18

(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíBomb and Key Messages Displaying More than once even when not checked Always or Held
Fixed

=== @ NightmareJames 10/14/2021 17:13

Confirmed fixed
