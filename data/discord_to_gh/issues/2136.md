It's funny, but ZC is so optimized now that I basically can't uncap without it being unplayable. I'd definitely appreciate a max FPS while uncapped setting to emulate the 2.50 use of it being a "speed up boring parts" button

What would a sensible default be?

=== @ Russ 01/22/2023 20:32

300? But allowing the player to change it would be cool too

It's certainly true that speeding up ZC for a little bit at a time does happen a lot.  Having this option would definitely be useful in some formation.

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "What would a sensible default‚Ä¶"): i'd think the option would just be like 0 is the default and means uncapped

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/22/2023 21:01

Uh, you're saying you want the default to be what happens right now?
And you have to hunt for the option to set it lower?

I mean, that seems sensible enough?
I'd add a gui option right next to the uncap toggle gui option

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 01/22/2023 21:43

If the only purpose of uncapping is to skip boring bits then it seems the default should be a sensible, watchable limit (Russ gave 300). Not infinity.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/22/2023 21:46

Eh, I guess. Having the default be what it always was would probably cause less confusion, but, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I'm trying to equivocate between the people who see the uncap button as a "technical" thing a la the FPS counter and the Take Screenshot button (i.e. the kind of person who'd pick the Disable Uncap Button QR), and those who consider it to be "normal" to use

=== @ Moosh 01/22/2023 21:56

If the uncap frame cap(?) was customizeable would setting it to lower than 60 cause a slow motion effect?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 01/22/2023 21:57

I... Would guess so
