A request for the Magic Key to be able to set map status, compass status, and boss key status
if you are in a DMap within its currently-existing level range option.

Attributes:
0: Keys
1: Maps
2: Compasses
3. Boss Keys
The Magic Compass can actually be extremely nifty to do a late-game "treasure hunt" in compassless quests - by giving it to you late in the game and telling you to go look in the rooms indicated by the compass in earlier levels.
The Magic Map mostly just serves as a convenience similar to Z1, but it can be used as an "atlas" item if you have custom dungeon map graphics and give it a range of DMaps to work in.

....using attributes for this sounds terrible
and, a "range"? A range would take 2 attributes per

The Magic Boss Key is inspired by Liberation of Hyrule, where James24 used the Magic Key to allow for certain lock blocks to be used, and to let you skip certain rooms. This would allow for the usage of normal keys in such a situation. It can also be used to unlock various places all across the game world, separate from normal keys.
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "and, a "range"? A range would…"): No, it uses the existing Magic Key level range. Basically, you set in an attribute whether it applies to keys, maps, compasses, or boss keys.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:25

oh wait
they already have a level range?

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:25

And it only applies to that one type of map item. You'd need 4 different items to have a complete set here.
yup

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:25

So, it would just be a flag for each
no more attributes

I don't get it - seems like we have a ton of unused attributes for Magic Keys

...why not use 4 flags instead?
that way you can check multiple off
and it's easier, not requiring looking up which value does what

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:26

Ah, mm. Didn't want to be wasteful of flags but I guess what else would this class need spare flags for?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:26

exactly
attributes are for when you need wide values
flags are for when you need simple toggles
...and again, even if we needed to expand item flags? That would not be the end of the world

=== @ P-Tux7 11/15/2021 07:27

yeaaaaaaah i forgot that attributes ALWAYS go 0-255, even if only a small range of them do anything in-engine
instead of 0-3 saving room
so flags it is

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/15/2021 07:28

err

they go far higher than 255
