For reference, this is what that forest screen is supposed to look like

Nice catch

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2023 00:03

`setCurrMap()` was loading a palette but not rebuilding the table
the warp button called the `dowarp()` function
which called `setCurrMap()` then `setCurrScreen()`
but, `setCurrScreen()`'s handling of palette stuff wouldn't work properly after a map change
so `setCurrMap()` had to handle that itself
(read the jargon as: should be fixed?)

@ Phosphor if you can test this in the latest 3.0 nightly that would be great

=== @ Phosphor 11/24/2023 03:11

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "@ Phosphor if you…"): works
oh lmao
"Yes" on the "Are you sure you want to quit?" dialogue does nothing

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2023 03:12

only if you do `File->Exit`, right?

=== @ Phosphor 11/24/2023 03:12

yes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/24/2023 03:12

(Just fixed that, after the nightly)
(connor beat you to the report lol)

It was because of the menu rewrite
the Exit button there was returning a D_CLOSE flag to signal the main menu (and thus the program) to close
....but the new menu system doesn't use those return flags, it ignores them.
So, just had to change it to use a global check (similarly to how `Alt+F4` or the window's `X` work)
