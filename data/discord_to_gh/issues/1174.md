Pretty simple, draw a polygon to the screen, give it more points than the supplied array allows, ZC hangs and becomes unresponsive

...........fucking really?
wow

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/13/2021 20:55

oh
fun
so, uh,
it just passes the arguments directly to allegro's `polygon`
and.... allegro's polygon doesn't like giving it more points than the array

@ Moosh see if this fixes it

it should, if you give more points than the array holds, reduce the points to what the array holds
so if you give a `[6]` array, but pass `4` for numpoints, it'll pretend you passed `3` instead, as that's the most that fits
also, it'll now do nothing if you give it 0 or negative number of points
given that I saw no sanity check on that either

err wait
I did a stupid
I was backdated to an old build while debugging the title thing and forgot to move forward
so that build will be quite broken
rebuilding now

@ Moosh is this fix good?

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:41

Ah right, lemme go test. Gotta re-make my setup where it was broken before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 11/14/2021 00:41

build doesn't have the title screen fixes
but if it works, nightly build will be posted with both

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:45

Appears to be working now, yes

=== @ Moosh 11/14/2021 00:46

```ffc script Polygon{
    void run(){
        while(true){
            int vert[22];
            for(int i=0; i<11; ++i){
                vert[i*2+0] = this->X+8+VectorX(24, i*(360/11));
                vert[i*2+1] = this->Y+8+VectorY(24, i*(360/11));
            }
            Screen->Polygon(6, 12, vert, 0x01, 128);
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}
```
Here's my test script for reference

woo, great
To be fair to whoever implemented this originally, the allegro function itself caused the lock-up
but, sanity checks are important
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíPolygon missing sanity checks
