I tried grabbing from James Quest:  Sidestory.  First I got this screen, when it's not passworded.
I forced my way in, grabbed tiles, that was OK
Then clicked "done", and it crashed anyway

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/20/2023 14:28

Does not occur grabbing from a random quest file, need you to provide the files

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/20/2023 16:51

I just noticed this, it seems quests saved in more recent builds (at least 113) don't open correctly to let you grab tiles from.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/20/2023 16:52

Quests saved in Nightly 3-20 open fine to grab tiles from, so it's not when the extra CSets got added that is breaking this.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/20/2023 16:54

(I'm guessing the data in recent versions got offset and the grabber is being thrown off by this?)

Instructions:

1.  Open tloz-definitive
2.  Graphics->Tiles
3.  Grab
4.  Open James Quest:  Sidestory.  Override the PW (there is none anyway, but it reads incorrectly)_
5.  Rip the Warp Tiles
6.  Press "Done"

It should crash

Am now on the April 19th Nightly and it appears that any transparent data on the image you're ripping is showing up as whatever's on the main panel beneath it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/22/2023 09:45

??????? How?
I mean, I managed to recreate it, so that's rhetorical
but like, what the fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/22/2023 09:50

...color `0xFF` is what's transparent, not `0`
<:nekoSigh:1012187680467075092> of course that color can appear in grabbed images

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/22/2023 12:41

Ahk, I just spent the last... *checks message timestamp* 3 hours rewriting a major piece of the code behind that one window. The transparency issue should be fixed. Also the file path should no longer go under the File button, instead it wraps to another line.
....which, this fixes Orithan's issue, I still haven't touched James's

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/22/2023 12:43

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "I just noticed this, it seems‚Ä¶"): is there any chance you could narrow down what build is the first broken for this?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 15:18

Sorry for the slow updates, this will take awhile since there is a larger range to check and I need to test if a quest saved in that build has issues being loaded from for tile grabbing.
I can narrow down that it is after 3-31, and is still in the current nightlies so it is not related to the other sanity fixes related to grabbing tiles from quests.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 15:27

...okay, it's not in 4-05. How recent to 113 is this gonna be?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 15:44

Uhh.... we got a problem. This looks more like something in the quest files isn't right.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 15:50

OH. Oh this just got *much* worse to test.
So, up to this point all I was doing was saving the quest file in the build, then trying to grab tiles from it. No issues in any version.
On a whim, compiled the scripts for a quest in the latest nightly, saved, then tried to grab tiles. Issue occurs.
So, saving after compiling scripts in some build is what is causing this weird "wants password and crashes" tile grabbing issue.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 15:56

Okay... this did exist back in 3-31

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 15:57

So, I notice after the compile (this was a quest last updated in 107) that it mentions the global variables have changed despite being the exact same code. I wonder if this is changing something that leads to a false "has password" flag when tile grabbing? Doesn't explain the crash though.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 16:02

....this has been around a *long* time. Happens in 1-03

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 16:10

At this point, assume this is a long overlooked bug introduced during the allegro 5 conversion, and instead ask "why does compiling scripts from pre-allegro 5 quests in these versions break tile grabbing. What flags could it possibly be setting somewhere it shouldn't?"

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 16:11

If you need an example....

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1098394590194716743/1100816423359623238/DuelingDragonsBuild.qst?ex=65e895af&is=65d620af&hm=9e48870a75c0ca7561cfa79c57a39b965c87703722fd54412e14b5f3a8700d1a&

First confirm you can grab tiles from that quest normally. Then compile it's scripts, save, and confirm you now have the password prompt come up even though the quest is unpassworded.
@ DeletedUser For your offending quest(s), have you compiled scripts and saved them in any build released since the allegro 5 conversion? Trying to spot a pattern here.

=== @ NightmareJames 04/26/2023 16:13

112

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 16:13

That counts

=== @ NightmareJames 04/26/2023 16:13

Then tried to recomple them new

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 04/26/2023 16:14

You can still grab tiles from quests not compiled in pre allegro 5 builds, right?
Even if you saved the quest in 112, as long as you haven't recompiled the scripts you can still grab those tiles?

=== @ NightmareJames 04/26/2023 16:15

i think 112 grabs fine regardless
I'll check it out after the doctor's appt

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/26/2023 22:22

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "So, I notice after the compil‚Ä¶"): The "global variables have changed" just means the Init script changed at all. Any quest compiled before 2.55 will change when compiled in 2.55 due to parser optimizations. Same goes for older 2.55 quests that are missing newer parser optimizations.
also, gonna @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) here, as this sounds absolutely insane and possibly beyond me

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 04/26/2023 22:52

You should try a bisect

=== @ NightmareJames 04/27/2023 02:31

Going to have to probably @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) .

=== @ NightmareJames 04/27/2023 16:27

My biggest issue is I'm under a bit of a crunch and it doesn't subside until May 11th

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 15:40

This still exists
@ HeroOfFireZC Want to help me bisect this?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 15:41

I think we got it covered, unless you have a case where compiling scripts and saving in recent builds does not prevent tile grabbing from said quest.

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 15:41

So you want me to try to recompile scripts in the latest nightly?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 15:42

So, the best way to test is take a quest from a pre-allegro 5 version that has scripts, and confirm you can grab tiles fro mit fine. Then compile the scripts and save in the recent builds and confirm that you can no longer grab tiles from that quest without the password prompt and crash occuring.
Try to keep a copy of the pre-allegro 5 quest on hand.

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 15:43

Just to reference, which nightly started Allegro 5?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 15:44

So if you do the steps above and something different happens (or doesn't break), you can post the quest and script files.
Uhh.....
Well, 107 was still allegro 4.

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 15:44

Most of my recent work is Alpha 112
Is Alpha 111 Allegro 5?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 15:44

Sometimes not long after that (in June - July last year) was the first allegro 5.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2023 15:44

your recent work doesn't matter
make a new test quest

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 15:44

So yeah, 108 and beyond should all be allegro 5.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2023 15:45

since the test is grabbing tiles, you need literally 0 screens

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 15:45

Emily, what was the first Allegro 5 build?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2023 15:45

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
fuck if I know
something between a107 and a108

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 15:45

So I'll make one in 107 and one in the latest then
Does that work?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2023 15:46

well, latest doesn't help at all
we know latest is broken
you need one in A107
and then test that quest
in every build
until it breaks

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 15:46

Granted, I posted a 107 quest + scripts above that I tested with, so this is just if you somehow find a scenario where you compile and save scripts and you can still grab tiles fine, to maybe narrow down if it's certain script stuff that causes it.

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 15:46

Fair enough
I can easily make a test quest in 107

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 15:47

We have an idea what causes quests to do this weird thing when grabbing tiles, we don't know *why*

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 15:47

You simplified my job a lot Emily

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 15:51

Here's a test in Alpha 107, going to start at 112 and go from there

Here I go

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 15:59

Alpha 112 fails, trying 111

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 16:03

OK, Alpha 111 works, grabbed a tile
Where do you want me to go next @ HeroOfFireZC ?
Grabbed a file from Sidestory 6.22, dated 10/18/2022

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 16:04

Did you compile scripts and save that quest in a recent build?
Just saving doesn't do it.

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 16:04

It's still saved in 107

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2023 16:04

yeah, no, that doesn't test anything then
you need to recompile scripts and resave in each build
before grabbing tiles from the quest

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 16:05

Okay. I'd suggest keep a copy of the quest saved in 107 somewhere.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/02/2023 16:05

^

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 16:05

Well, 112 failed outright
I'll retry 111

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 16:05

Then compile the scripts and save in a version, then try to grab tiles from it.

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 16:05

Yes sir
Just so Emily can laugh at my dumb script

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 16:06

If you are still able to grab tiles after that with no password prompt or crash, post the 107 saved version and script files for the devs to look over and try to figure out what does / does not change.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 05/02/2023 16:07

I mean, if this script is enough to cause this, that would means saving with newly compiled scripts in general breaks tile grabbing.
Rather than something specific in a large script file doing it.
So it will help by narrowing *that* down at least.

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 16:08

OK, the Test Quest just grabbed from Sidestory 6.22 dated 10/18/2022 after recompiling the test quest
In Alpha 111
What's the next step?

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 16:11

Should I bisect?  Should I try something more modern?
Sorry if I'm being a pain, just trying to follow directions closely

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/02/2023 16:37

Bisect is the way to go
Still got that list I gave you some time ago?

hmm above you say 1/23/2023 is fine and it fails?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 05/02/2023 20:33

some parser changes in https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/compare/nightly-2023-01-10...nightly-2023-01-23

=== @ NightmareJames 05/02/2023 23:44

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "hmm above you say 1/23/2023 i‚Ä¶"): To generally explain, it usually fails when you have compiled scripts when BOTH quests are 1/23/2023 and above
That's what I narrowed it down to
One was an upgraded quests from 107 to 1/23/2023
The other was a fresh 1/23/2023 quest
And it replicated beautifully

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/03/2023 00:02

(replying to @ NightmareJames "To generally explain, it usua‚Ä¶"): err, you shouldn't be grabbing from a quest saved NEWER ever
the same way you should never load a quest saved newer
so, if the quest you're grabbing from is 1/23/2023, the quest you're grabbing from *HAS* to be as well

=== @ NightmareJames 05/03/2023 00:03

Even if it's saved in the same nightly?
I upgraded the first one to the 1/23/2023 Nightly even though it started earlier

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/03/2023 00:04

?
The moment you save the file
it can never be touched by any version earlier than the version it is saved in
ever

=== @ NightmareJames 05/03/2023 00:05

Hrmmmmmm
Let me test it the OTHER way around

=== @ NightmareJames 05/03/2023 00:10

OK Emily, further narrowing down
This upgraded quest is having trouble, but when I port from the newer quest from the upgraded quest, there is no issue
Both of these are final saved in the same nightly though (the newer quest was formerly uploaded)

Unfotunately this is a multi-tiered problem, but it starts at 1/23/2023, wherever it is
Sorry I can't report more at the moment

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 05/03/2023 01:04

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "some parser changes in https:‚Ä¶"): ...I see so very little this could POSSIBLY be, basically everything here is ZC-only, not ZQ
the only ZQ things look fine, they look like perfectly routine parser additions
in ways that could not possibly affect the loading of a quest file
@ DeletedUser so, the 1/10/2023 nightly is working without issue?

=== @ NightmareJames 05/03/2023 01:06

Yes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 18:54

I did fix many loading issues wrt memory corruption in recent nightlies. Could be related to the problem seen here.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 18:55

This is a long thread üôÇ Anyone care to TLDR with repro steps?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 18:55

Bah, you found it before I could. Anyway, above I posted a quest and it's script file from 107 for testing purposes.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 18:57

I confirmed that if you just grab tiles from that quest as-is, no issue. If you open the quest in a newer build, recompile the scripts, then save, trying to grab tiles for that same quest now triggers the bug.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 19:27

@ HeroOfFireZC wild guess... can you reproduce this without any `.zcheat` file in the directory (or, if theres some other keyfile that ZQ would read ...)?
I ask because I found a use-after-free memory bug while saving a qst file, when all I did was change from no-password to some password.
the memory bug ocurrs while writing to a .zcheat file...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 19:31

an unfortunate copy/paste mistake here with file handles

this is all right next to the qst saving code so bad things might happen to the qst file

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 19:47

I couldn't recreate the problem with or without fixing the above bug. @ HeroOfFireZC let me know if you still can.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 19:48

here's the lateset unreleased code that fixes the above file handle problem just in case you need it

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 20:38

Sorry for the delay, so, if there was a .zcheat or .zpwd file, would they be in the same directory as the .exes?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 20:39

i think they get saved next to the qst file?

All I do when a new build comes out is download it and copy the three .cfg files over.
Are they files that get generated based on quest options? I don't think I have any files like that?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 20:41

it may just be when a password is set in the qst header

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2023 20:41

Yeah it should only be when you change the quest password

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 20:41

but i was thinking it was possible there was some global password file that gets applied in some cases for any qst opened. thats probably wrong
so would make it unrealted to the problem at hand here
anyhow, i couldn't repro so does that mean this is fixed for you too?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 20:42

But yeah, I can recreate this in 114. Let me grab the newest nightly and see if it got fixed since.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 20:43

If you could, a video would be helpful so I know I'm doing the same steps as you

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 20:44

The process I do for testing is.... open zQuest, grab files from DuelingDragonsBuild.qst, works fine. Now open that quest, compile DuelDragonScripts.zs, save. Now when I try to grab files from the quest it asks for a password, displays no tiles to grab from, and when I leave the tile editor zQuest closes.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 20:53

Okay, better question. Let me post the resulting quest I can no longer grab tiles from and see if you encounter the same thing.

All this is is the quest from above, compiled with the scripts from above in the newest Nightly and saved.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 20:54

I can look but if the problem was the qst file got corrupted it's moot to look at the result

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 20:55

Meanwhile, you have given me something to try.
Let me make a copy of this quest where it is passworded and repeat the steps to see if anything changes.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 20:55

Ah I was simply opening the newly saves qst file not trying to grab

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 21:00

No change. The quest having / not having a password doesn't change anything.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 21:04

Also reconfirmed that the bug does not occur just by saving the quest. It is specific to saving after recompiling scripts, so.... back to the question at hand, what is getting saved differently that tile grabbing specifically breaks? And why is it when it breaks it starts by asking for a password even if the quest is unpassworded?
If there is something in the quest file that gets read to determine if it should bring up the password prompt when tile grabbing, start from there?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 21:06

I keep wondering if it's just some weird indexing change that tile grabbing isn't properly updated for when everywhere else is fine?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 22:33

I found the problematic code, thanks.

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 23:01

Only question, can the fix salvage quests already affected? It's probably been a year since the allegro 5 upgrade, any scripted quest saved within that time would be affected.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 23:03

yes the tile data is all there, when I simply delete the pwd check it is fine
(reason #123 to just removed passwords)
what I am looking into now is how this happened
also this tile grab quest loading code does not check the return code of the load, which is hiding problems
it is also correctly loading the pwd_hash (which has a null value) but then by the time it checks it, somehow the value is changed. odd.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 23:05

relevant comment lol

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 23:07

my guess is this function's usage of `skip_flags` has found a place that breaks loading
it skips all but the header and tile sections, which likely hits branches of code not really validated to work
prob why the return code is ignored
quite the nasty situation this bug has found lol

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 23:08

Huh, so is recompiling the scripts in these newer builds setting a flag that this skip_flags gets tripped up at?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 23:09

Yeah it could be only present for newer data in the qst format

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 23:09

Cause as long as you didn't recompile, it "worked fine" (except sounds like just barely)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 23:09

which a resave would trigger
scripts have versioning to iirc
so could be connected to that

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/09/2023 23:10

Well it must be the script versioning, cause you can resave and nothing breaks. It's only if you also recompiled.
(well, perhaps there are other things you can do to the quest that upon resave could trigger, the script thing is the one I confirmed)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 23:12

yeah its the ffdata section

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 23:19

yeah so on loadquest failure we _do not_ write the header data into the header struct given by the load function
and loadquest can fail for sections even if "skipped"
resulting the password check failing because the header data is empty

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 23:42

this is the bug
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1098394590194716743/1127746728276279440/image.png?ex=65e50afc&is=65d295fc&hm=52e1caee67448159ef87cf07455d8e78a5404ddae16c62b64162d95644956f68&)
we _must_ actually write to this variable so we keep reading the section correctly
I know I can modify this entire loading procedure to _truly_ skip a section if skipped
but right now, we read it all and need to advance the file pointer correctly

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 23:45

btw this was 10 months ago
unrelated to allgro 5, but same timeframe

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2023 23:48

Fixed. I've also enable the "show progress" ui for loading the quest here.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/11/2023 00:01

oop yeah that makes sense lol

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/14/2023 16:22

Just as a side note, I tried to load a really old quest in 115 (probably 2.10 or early 2.50) and while it didn't ask for a password it also failed to load the tilesheet and crashed zQuest after closing the tile editor. Saving this quest and trying again made it work, so... maybe have a FAQ somewhere to suggest saving a quest in the newest versions if you plan on grabbing from it just in case?
(the quest in question, which prior to being resaved is dated early 2008 so... yeah)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/14/2023 17:44

No need to add to a FAQ... Let's just fix the bug üôÇ

That qst is the old version right?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 07/14/2023 17:49

Yes

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/29/2023 23:14

I believe I just fixed this (not currently released).

=== @ NightmareJames 07/31/2023 13:15

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) Did you release the fix to this in the 7-31-2023 Nightly?
Or were trying to test it?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/31/2023 17:37

It should be fixed in latest yes

=== @ NightmareJames 07/31/2023 18:22

Then this bug is dead, please close.  I have verified it using the original source.  If anyone wants to double test it please feel free
