repro:

- checkout z3 branch
- ASAN, set breakpoint on `draw_textbox` in SW_SelectedText::draw
- run z3.qst and step over above break point. should exit program with memory overflow error

i also set a breakpoint here ^
input text: "Bow 2 (Long) & Arrow 3 (Golden)"
first time hitting above breakpoint: scanned is "(Golden)"
second time scanned is empty string `""`
so then scanned gets advanced one more, and is now garbage
result is random crashing

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) does anything seem obviously wrong with this function to you?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/23/2023 18:26

I have no fucking idea that function looks fancy

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/23/2023 18:27

I modified it as little as possible when doing subscreen stuff

what `new_subscreen_active` pointed to somehow got deleted w/o setting this variable to null

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/24/2023 05:25

ah, fek

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/24/2023 21:44

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "ah, fek"): Do you know how to fix this?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/24/2023 21:47

No idea

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/25/2023 00:03

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/blob/main/src/new_subscr.cpp#L1683

should this be `itemsbuf[btnitem_ids[btn] & 0xF000].family` ?
i have a `itype_bowandarrow` item assigned to BWpn which i think makes my quest crash since its id is `61497`
much larger than itembufs

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/25/2023 00:09

...no thats still way too big

idk how the return value of `SW_ItemSlot::getItemVal` is meant to be used here when accessing itemsbuf
but it seems like its too big
for https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/blob/main/src/new_subscr.cpp#L2755

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2023 00:11

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) https:/…"): ...PFFFT
Why am I doing `& 0xF000` there? That should be `& 0x0FFF`, it's backwards

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/25/2023 00:12

Sooo do we have no replays that use this item type? Odd
I'd think bow and arrow super common

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2023 00:13

or wait no
I read your message wrong
err, it should still be `&0xFFF` though
but I didn't have it backwards, I just didn't have it there

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/25/2023 00:15

It's not 0xFF?
Like last line of method

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 08/25/2023 00:26

err
it's 0xFFF in some places and 0xFF in others
pretty sure it doesn't matter since the 0xF00 bits are unused

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 08/25/2023 19:33

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "what `new_subscreen_active` p…"): I fixed everything mentioned here but this. But I don't see this happening any more after all my other bug fixes. so closing.
