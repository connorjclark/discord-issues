I'd really appreciate a simpler relational combo system that only supports 16x16 pieces and only has these combos. Most dungeons don't need all of the options that current relational combos have, and it's a pain to set up for tile makers and quest makers alike.
Example walls from Super Mario World:

@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) i'm gonna be honest having to place dungeons/areas tile by tile really kills my motivation to use zquest so i'd really appreciate this
not you guys' fault or anything just letting you know how important it is

Pahahahahaha
I'm not fucking touching the cursed bullshit that is relational combos
Deedee can feel free if she wants

Sure thing
@ P-Tux7 this might take a bit though, cause I want to look into other things with aliases and stuff

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:08

Add it as a new mode you scroll through, so `Normal`, `Relational`, `Relational16`, `Dungeon`, `Alias`

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/15/2021 21:08

mainly, I want to have the switch button be *per combo pane*
Because as it stands, aliases are annoying to use

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/15/2021 21:10

*OOOOH*
uh
that's a big undertaking
while you're at it, make aliases not turn your cursor invisible?

(replying to @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) "@ P-Tux7 this m…"): No problem
(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "Add it as a new mode you scro…"): Yeah this was my thought
It's not like we can break the relational combos sets that already exist anyways
...all 10 of them but

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I'm not fucking touching the…"): The dungeon mode is much worse than relational mode.  It's no wonder I never see anyone uses this useful feature.  It is painfully tedious, confusing to set up and time consuming process.

RPG maker for PC's uses this exact "Simple" relational drawing!
