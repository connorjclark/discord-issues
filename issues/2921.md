From what has been gathered, some `SaveScreenSettings` stuff in 2.55 builds are untested, probably broken. The result is that in most quests (especially older ones), calling Game->ShowSaveQuitScreen(); results in a menu where the text is defaulted to a hardcoded value, which can be Black on a Black Background in many quests.

not sure exactly what's wrong, but there are several blatant issues, including values that appear not to be reset between quest loads, so could carry from one quest to the next.... and additionally, it calls the reset function both before and after loading the quest in `init_game()`, which seems weird.
