1. Load a 2.50-2.53 quest that has "Can Select A button in active subscreen" QR set on.
2. Assign an item to a button during gameplay.

Sound that plays when item assigned to an action button is played continiously until player releases assignned button, instead of just playing once.

`rAbtn` was eating the input

new code from subscreen rewrite: `byte btn_press = getIntBtnInput(0xFF, true, false, false, false, true);`

`byte getIntBtnInput(byte intbtn, bool press, bool drunk, bool ignoreDisable, bool eatEntirely, bool peek)`
so not being eaten
@EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) what should be done?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2024 02:04

It should be eaten since `bool press` is true?
That being true is identical to rAbtn()...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 02:07

oh. and setting eatEntirely to true didnt change anything

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2024 02:07

Idr what that even does offhand
Probably used in like one place or something

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 02:09

will try narrowing the range, have to build locally a bit

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 02:11

actually cannot, various commits here do not build.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 02:16

changing `peek` to false fixes it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2024 02:17

Oh shit that's... Yeah missed that, it's a peek..
Hopefully that was a copy paste error and not needed for some reason?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 02:21

the usages in that function seem unnecessary to fire more than once
not sure about `widg->check_btns(bpress,*new_subscreen_active);` tho

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2024 02:28

Oh, that'd be it
That probably needs it to be a peek

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 02:30

so you can hold once and pages will go by?
I assume it doesn't fly through the pages because this code does not run during the animation

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2024 02:31

Err, point being I think the item selection code not being a peek would eat the button
So it wouldn't change any pages at all if set, as the button is already eaten
(it should probably use a peek for everything, and then eat everything at the end?)

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 02/17/2024 02:32

The top of this loop sets `btn_press`. The item selection code and the page change use the same value.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 02/17/2024 02:32

Oh
Hmm
Then not sure
(on Mobile so)
And for the life of me I can't scroll through that commit on Mobile
