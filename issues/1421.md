For instance, if non-solid combo underneath enemy changes into a solid combo, the enemy is insta-killed, like switch blocks in Mario Maker 2 and dwarven bridge in Dwarf Fortress. And specific enemies that can move through solid combos are immune to it.

This would take quite a bit of coding, and would likely be related to solid ffc stuff (i.e. crushing/pushing for moving ffcs)
So, good idea, but don't expect soon

You might be able to accomplish this with a script and inherit combo flags

I mean

It could even be a combo script 😎

```cpp
npc script telefrag
{
    void run()
    {
        while(true)
        {
            if(Screen->isSolid(this->X+8,this->Y+8))
                this->HP = 0;
            Waitframe();
        }
    }
}```
You'd just do that a an npc script

🚀

You'd probably want to account for offsets and size stuff
But, on mobile, so fuck that right now

Pro mobile coding right here
