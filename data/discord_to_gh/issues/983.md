here's a demo of the shenanigans
after `update_weapon_frame()` for each weapon creation, if the new QR is set, call `o_tile = tile;` to update the originaltile and make the animation fucking work

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 07:00

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/04/2021 07:04

try this

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 07:05

@ DeletedUser if you can confirm it's fixed (and/or list what weapon types are still bugged) - you need to toggle the backwards compat rule off

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/04/2021 07:05

It's in backwards compatibility
wait shit
forgot something

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 07:05

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/04/2021 07:05

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 07:08

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 07:11

the update seems to crash zc

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 07:23

it only crashes when you try to play a custom quest strangely

=== @ P-Tux7 09/04/2021 08:03

ooh does this mean we can get animated 4-way lweapons now
i'd like to ask the same for eweapons

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 08:06

not exactly. this is just trying to fix how adding frames to weapons-mostly ones with a horizontal to vertical animation wouldn't work properly
how adding more frames would just make the horizontal tiles use the vertical tiles

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 08:12

so it's still the basic up-down and left-right setup, only now its being updated to where you can have multiple frames of animations for both instead of only having multiple frames for the up-down tile(s)

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 08:15

idk if this will also affect eweapons

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 08:16

should
lweapons and eweapons aren't really different things internally

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 08:17

i see

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 08:17

literally `class weapon`

=== @ Guinevere 09/04/2021 08:17

we'll see when i try it out
what works
what doesn't
what breaks

=== @ P-Tux7 09/04/2021 08:34

i noticed zelda.exe is now at more than 4 mb, what changed recently?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 08:35

it's been over 4mb for a while
and, uh, more lines of code would be what changed
because more features
exe size is just the raw code itself

=== @ P-Tux7 09/04/2021 08:41

yeah i know but i could have sworn less than a month ago it was at like 4.00

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/04/2021 18:34

I know qst file size got a beeeeeg bump cause new combo attributes

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/04/2021 21:25

yeah, though that has no effect on exe size
`.qst` and `.sav` size we directly control
but `.exe` size is based on code added, and not easily controlled
