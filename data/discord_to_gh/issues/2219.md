you can click the colour you're on and clicking elsewhere on the palette places it there. if you click once you can push the colour there, but if you click a second time it cancels it

as per my discussions with emily in #deleted-channel - this is happening in a hotfix i was sent to test for other bugs atm *but* i have had it happen since i downloaded the march 3 nightly.

(meta) thread name was changed: cset editor selection bug
additionally, this happens when you click into a cset through the palette editor

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:21

so like, edit -> select whatever colour -> the colour you have selected will jump there

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:22

...I just thought of like 2 different ways to brute force fix this by adding sanity checks
.........and when I then looked, they were ***already there***

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:22

amazing
LOLWHAT

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:22

which means even those ideas aren't working
like
what the fuck
something is seriously wrong here

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:29

could you test this build https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZQuestClassic/releases/tag/nightly-2023-02-22
and A112
(if it isn't happening in this build no need to test A112)

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:30

one sec

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:32

no rush I may fall asleep any second soo

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:32

same except it's 10 pm so probably slightly more socially acceptable

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:33

It's 6:30 am sooo
very good sleep cycles I have lol

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:33

god i miss the 5 am marathons
now i get up at 5 am and i hate it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:33

I woke at like 5pm
or was it 3
something afternoon/eveningy

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:34

was the sun out in any form
does not look to be happening in that build btw

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:34

pretty sure
ah, ok, that's.....
On one hand a relief

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:35

fucking around with a default quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:35

on the other hand fucking confusing as hell

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:35

yeah, managed to reproduce it in that hotfix build with a blank quest too

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:36

so the fun thing is
....starting in the build you said it does not happen in
***not a single line of code has changed at all in that function***

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:36

what the fuck

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:36

so something somewhere entirely unrelated must have fucked something up somehow
and, like, for the record, it's not a you problem, I reproduced it instantly

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:37

yeah i figured as much being able to make it happen in a blank quest

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/05/2023 11:37

soooo
I'm gonna @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) and hope he has some magical insight
(`jwin_cset_proc`,`zq_cset.cpp` for the record)

=== @ tacochopper 03/05/2023 11:37

i'm starting to get paranoid that the main file for three crests is gonna have issues but i suspect that's because i've stuffed it full of scripts, not because of palette or ZQ shit lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/18/2023 14:15

OK
Not sure what WAS wrong here
but I just... rewrote the mouse behavior entirely for that widget.
and it's fine now!

=== @ tacochopper 03/18/2023 15:08

hell yes!!!

=== @ tacochopper 03/19/2023 09:08

errrr
still persistent for me lol

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/19/2023 09:21

err, what?

=== @ tacochopper 03/19/2023 09:31

yeah that original error where it was doing the thing upon opening the cset editor? *still* happening

=== @ tacochopper 03/19/2023 09:32

i'm gonna test again with another download but uh, wtf

=== @ tacochopper 03/19/2023 09:35

yeah... it's very touch and go? like sometimes it does it, sometimes it doesn't

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/19/2023 09:35

it stopped happening to me though
It happens if you click+drag, obviously, that part is intended
but just clicking it isn't happening

=== @ tacochopper 03/19/2023 09:36

hang on i'll record a screen capture
just broke my chair as i was typing lmfao

=== @ tacochopper 03/19/2023 09:38

soooo the only thing i can think of is that i'm using the e hotkey to open up the editor and then trying to work at light speed

=== @ tacochopper 03/19/2023 09:39

i think that might literally be it. clicking on the edit button with the mouse is fine

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/19/2023 09:43

I can't get it to happen
no matter how fast I go

=== @ tacochopper 03/19/2023 09:44

wtf
how am i causing it

=== @ tacochopper 03/19/2023 09:46

it's weird cos it's only happening like, 2 out of 5 times on average for me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 03/19/2023 09:46

It's happening like 0 out of 200 for me
