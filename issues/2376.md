When hovering over an empty name, pressing Start should automatically prompt you to enter your name.  This is how most save file dialogs work now and would be a nice newcomer change.

I know ZC automatically orders save files to avoid blank spots, so if you press Start on a file that's further down, I think it would be fine to snap to the first available slot.
