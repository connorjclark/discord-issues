Noticed during a playthrough that in a quest where Rupees have their Max set to 9999 in Init Data they were capping at 999.

When I trace MCounter, it claims it's 9999.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2023 23:14

but `Counter` won't go above 999?
...or is it just the subscreen DISPLAYING the wrong number?

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/15/2023 23:15

...good question, it is set to display 3 digits, so it goes from 000 to 1000+ in older versions.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2023 23:20

Min or max digits set, on the current version?

because for a MAX digits of 3, this would be the intended behavior

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/15/2023 23:22

Okay, it is 3.... hmm.....
It's working as intneded... but looks like it isn't, cause it needed to go up to 4 digits in the past versions.
So.... how would a version update address this? Cause otherwise this means a *lot* of quests need to change their counters.
Change the Max Digits value in places.

(replying to @ HeroOfFireZC "It's working as intneded... b…"): ah
crap
loader error, wrong value on loading old quests, should be easy fix
I see why this got missed

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/15/2023 23:24

So.... should all old quests just auto set to 4 or 5 max digits to be safe?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2023 23:24

0
for "no max"

=== @ HeroOfFireZC 09/15/2023 23:24

Okay, easy fix then.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2023 23:24

it was setting it to the default of 3
which should be the default when creating a NEW counter in the editor
but not loading an old quest counter

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/15/2023 23:27

should be fixed
