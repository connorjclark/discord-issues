Usually seems to happen when the ZC windows loses focus; the background shadow still draws correctly, but the text/numbers themselves don't draw. The shadow seems to be much smaller than the size the numbers draw, but I don't recall it looking off when the numbers were displaying.

Known issue but, temporary fix for now may be to toggle Fullscreen state
