FFC Freeform Combos Need More Drawover Layers

There is only 1 Drawover layer, but i need it some levels higher.

actually would be nice to be able to set FFC layer

not happening until rewrite
adding more flags to ffcs costs too much memory

rip

...could we make one of the arbitrary FFC arguments used to determine what layer it is?

=== @ P-Tux7 09/14/2021 18:41

It'd be hacky but better than nothing
Maybe a QR that enables an Init Data field which lets you set which of the argument #s determines the layer of the FFC
Or just a QR hardcoding it to the last argument

beyond the ffc stuff, it would take a lot of fucking with draw shit
I'd really rather not until rewrite

=== @ SkyLizardGirl 09/17/2021 04:35

Aww
