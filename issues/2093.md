Themes don't work, unless `gui_colorset = 99` is set in the (now, no longer provided) `zc.cfg` or `zquest.cfg`. Looks like the value isn't being  inherited from the base config / or maybe is not loading early enough.

...oop.
Maybe just remove the gui_colorset shit and just make themes always used
probably worth replacing that crap

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 09:30

same for `invalid_static` i think

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/16/2022 17:58

nooo
you will get tons of complaints at that one
people actively use that and hate having it off

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/16/2022 17:59

I'm saying the config inheritance is not working there either
Just two I noticed while updating web version, which was first time I ran with a clean install (no existing cfg) in awhile. Sure there's more

oh
brain
lol
....I'm very confused why it wouldn't be working

.....sooo, debugging this
every single config seems to work exactly as expected
....so whatever this issue is, it seems likely to be platform-dependant @connorjclark (discord: connorclark)
I will note that `invalid_static` has an internal default different from the default in the base config file
as did gui_colorset
so, that's why those are the things that were affected
.....but they work absolutely fine on windows

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/18/2022 03:02

......also

Was this meant to be `#ifndef`?
guessing so

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "Themes don't work, unless `gu…"): As for "Not loading early enough", that doesn't apply at all. It loads when it has always loaded, nothing about that timing changes.
I removed the old theme shit anyway, so that should work now regardless. I didn't change `invalid_static` at all, so you can use that to debug this.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/18/2022 03:54

(replying to @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) "I will note that `invalid_sta…"): That was it–and my Debug folder happened to not yet have a base_config folder in it yet, so it used that default.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/18/2022 03:56

pfffffft
.....not having the base configs would indeed make the base configs not work
