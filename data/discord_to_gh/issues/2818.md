11-03-2 nightly, don't know what else to call it apart from that tbh. if you edit a tile, and press ok, it will save the output in the bottom two windows as per the second image.

it's touchy about how it does it. the first time it happened the glitched out tile appeared on the tile page like the third image, but it opened up fine in the editor. pressing "ok"/saving the tile a *second* time causes this tile to be glitched permanently

adding to this report since it seems likely (although i'm not 100% sure, so i'm sorry if this should have been a separate report) that this issue is related:

shifting tiles using alt+arrow keys in the editor also causes odd things to happen - it only shifts the top 8 pixels of a tile and causes the palette for that tile to glitch out.

the video shows what happens if you use arrow keys up and down first (shifts only top 8 pixels left and right, then up and down), then arrow keys left and right (shifts only top 8 pixels and causes color data corruption - possible bit overflow thing, maybe? i don't know enough about the technical details to be certain)

i can also confirm that the feature worked fine in A119, so this glitch appears to have been introduced since then

nightly 2023-11-04-2

Thanks for the reports, they should be resolved now. Please let me know after trying in next nightly (~40m).

I tried a bunch of stuff in the tile pages and made sure they worked. I'm not 100% about the Overlay feature wrt to color/csets, let me know if that is not working as you'd expect.

=== @ Rambly 11/04/2023 18:58

thanks for the prompt response - i'll give the next nightly a whirl after it drops and let you know if overlaying still works okay (if i don't get to it tonight, someone else can feel free to try too)

=== @ cbailey78 11/05/2023 01:20

The color glitching by shifting tiles by the arrow keys seem to only occur on grabbed tiles.
I'm using the latest nightly by the way.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2023 01:28

hmm, not seing anything like that...
just noticed tile 0 gets bottom half overwritten during grab
simply by entering that dialog and doing nuthin

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2023 06:53

I fixed an issue w/ colors being wrong when grabbing 4-bit tiles. And yeah I can see how that would have caused the tile pixel editor madness
new build ~40m

[nightly 2023-11-05] i went ahead and tested some tile overlay stuff. here's the results. in the video, the left column is the tile to overlay, the second column is the tile to be overlaid onto, and the third column is the expected result. i've also listed the A119 behavior as a reference for what should be happening

- overlaying an 8-bit tile onto another 8-bit tile works as expected. no issues here
- A119 behavior: same as above

- overlaying a 4-bit tile onto an 8-bit tile makes it so that all the colors from the 4-bit tile use cset 0, even if the in-editor selected cset is higher
- A119 behavior: the colors from the 4-bit tile would be shifted up to the cset that's actively being used in the tile editor (eg. 0x03 would become 0x83 if overlaid in cset 8).

- overlaying an 8-bit tile onto a 4-bit tile causes the 4-bit tile to have garbage colors from outside the cset. they seem to be pointing to colors 0x123 and above, which shouldn't even exist (that's cset 18). my guess is it's copying the absolute value 0xA3 into the color data and not the relative 0x03. (notice how the highlighted colors are at the bottom of the screen and how it always says the color is "Black". also notice how the tile display itself in the upper right is corrupted)
- A119 behavior: the colors from the 8-bit tile are shifted to "relative colors" to be used by csets (eg. color 0xA3 would become color 0x03, which would be shown as 0x83 when viewed in cset 8). 



(sorry if this is all a bit convoluted, and sorry if it's resulted in you guys having to push more nightlies than you would have otherwise. for me, personally, none of these bugs are really critical - i don't use 8-bit tiles too often and most of the overlaying i do tends to be 4-bit tiles onto other 4-bit tiles - but i figured i'd be diligent and test different combinations of overlays anyway. they might be critical for someone else!)

Thanks Rambly, this was a wonderful breakdown. I believe I've resolved the overlay issues now.

=== @ Rambly 11/05/2023 22:20

np! glad it helped!

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/05/2023 22:36

should be fixed in nightly now

@ Majora can you look too when you can

=== @ Majora 11/06/2023 03:06

@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) as far as I can tell, in 11-05-2 build, tile editor works normally and overlaying 4-bit tile onto 8-bit tile will overlay it in the CSet it was overlayed in.

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 11/06/2023 03:07

thanks!

=== @ Majora 11/06/2023 03:07

overlaying 8 bit onto 4 bit does not produce garbage colors
