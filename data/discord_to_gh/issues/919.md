=== @ tim 08/18/2021 19:32

=== @ NightmareJames 08/18/2021 19:33

Memorial == confirmed passed away

=== @ P-Tux7 08/18/2021 19:34

yeah elise died

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 08/18/2021 19:37

(replying to @ tim "and i dont think he's been ac‚Ä¶"): Yeah, Elise was his reason for being in the community.  üòï  A shame for both of them.

=== @ Jigglysaint 08/18/2021 19:37

I mean I wished Freedom would be dead, but that's not on topic

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 08/18/2021 19:37

Oof.

=== @ Jigglysaint 08/18/2021 19:38

however, if we have any quests by somebody named Larry Reynome(orhowever it's spelt), I can confirm he is dead

=== @ Employees Must Wash Hans 08/18/2021 19:39

Hm.  Doesn't ring a bell.

=== @ Jigglysaint 08/18/2021 19:39

yeah it was a long time ago
I forget exactly what his AGN name was
is there an archive?

=== @ tim 08/18/2021 19:42

could check when agn's host isnt shitting itself
some issue with the storage currently and its the same instance zc.com is on

=== @ Jigglysaint 08/18/2021 19:44

He had Cystic Fibrosis

=== @ NightmareJames 08/18/2021 20:10

LReyome254 died too?
My God

=== @ Jigglysaint 08/18/2021 20:11

yes
I was facebook friends with him for a while
I was online when I found out

=== @ NightmareJames 08/18/2021 20:12

When was this?
Did he get a formal announcement on the forums?

=== @ Jigglysaint 08/18/2021 20:13

I don't believe so
and this was years ago

=== @ NightmareJames 08/18/2021 20:13

I remember him, but this was before I came down with T2 Diabetes
Find me the information, he's getting formally announced too
He was a pretty big part of the community

=== @ Jigglysaint 08/18/2021 20:15

facebook turned up only 2 accounts
one doesn't seem like it's him, and the other is a dead account
but the first does mention cystic fibrosis
https://www.facebook.com/LarryReyome
it is him
yup, for sure
I unfriend him after he died

=== @ tim 08/18/2021 20:17

o_-

=== @ Jigglysaint 08/18/2021 20:18

Looks like he died in 2017
there is a post from may 1rst, 2020 that mentions the 3rd year annaversary

=== @ NightmareJames 08/18/2021 20:27

I just hope I don't run into any more nasty surprises after becoming acting head........
Learning about Imzogelmo and Reyome is tough
Spent a lot of time with those two
I have been living under a rock

=== @ Jigglysaint 08/18/2021 20:50

That's how I felt when I learned about Glenn and Dark Nation

=== @ P-Tux7 08/18/2021 21:17

i should mention that since freedom is still alive i'll be asking his permission

=== @ P-Tux7 08/18/2021 22:26

did dark nation release any quests or tilesets
or at least have a tie to one like elise's presence in search for elise and swansong: genesis

=== @ P-Tux7 08/19/2021 16:39

can anyone think of any other dead users and what they worked on or inspired
wild bill - ocarina of power/fall uh de honky pig
glenn the great - 4th quest/cgbz first quest
imzogelmo - 5th quest
elise - search for elise/swansong genesis
dark nation - ???
lreyome254 - ???

=== @ NightmareJames 08/19/2021 16:40

Teilyr

=== @ P-Tux7 08/19/2021 16:40

oh damn DAMN

=== @ NightmareJames 08/19/2021 16:40

But that was a LONG time ago

=== @ P-Tux7 08/19/2021 16:41

teilyr made a chain of destiny demo
https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=tilesets&id=53

=== @ P-Tux7 08/19/2021 16:43

it's released as a tileset but you can load it in the zc player and there's at least one dungeon iirc

=== @ tim 08/19/2021 16:51

tei the king of under over bridges
