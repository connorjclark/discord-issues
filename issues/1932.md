I have a whole bunch of pit warps that use SFX 38.  If I go down a regular set of stairs with no sound attached, nothing plays.  But if I jump in a pit with this SFX, suddenly other sets of stairs also have this effect playing.

@ Jigglysaint this doesn't happen for me, so you're gonna need to give more info
Maybe screenshot the attributes tab for the pit and the stairs?

send me the quest file, saved on a room that has the problem

=== @ Jigglysaint 09/29/2022 12:39

do you have my quest file from yesterday?

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2022 12:39

yes
what map/screen

=== @ Jigglysaint 09/29/2022 12:40

map 10, the screen with the pits you jump down are screen 50
when you jump down the pits and head up the stairs, you still get the jump sound
Chest is "4" so if you need to emable walk through walls

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2022 12:42

if you use testing mode in zquest it starts with cheat 4 active already
even if you have no codes set up

=== @ Jigglysaint 09/29/2022 12:42

good to know
tested on pitfalls and it does not change the stairs sfx

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 09/29/2022 12:46

Fixed
someone made a simple mistake probably a long time ago
