A combo intended to emulate various effects that are caused by the engine in various situations, but giving the quest creator control of them. To END these effects, the combo should be set to cycle or self-trigger upon a timer.

To keep a seamless effect, this combo should ideally check to see if there is another combo of the same type in the neighbouring rooms, and wait a frame before killing the effect when rooms are changed so that if one makes neighbouring rooms with the same effect, the effect does not restart upon screen transitions, like how a Wavy DMap does not reset its waves every room.

Flags:
-Quake: The same quake seen in the Quake Hammer/Super Quake scrolls.
-Wavy: The same wavy effect seen when the DMap is set to be wavy/underwater.
-Greyscale (Classic): The same greyscale effect that is seen when a bomb detonates in Zelda 1. As the name implies, it is largely kept for historical purposes.
-Load Level Pal: Changes the current loaded level palette until a transition that would overwrite it happens.
-Load ESPal: Loads the specified Extra Sprite Palette (BPal) over CSet 14, again until another combo or an enemy flagged with a boss palette overwrited it. Useful for, say, having a boss show up in a cutscene as a regular combo before the "real NPC" loads in the needed CSet 14. Or load it at the beginning of the quest for another CSet if you're crazy like HeroofFire.
-Tint: The entire palette is tinted a certain colour.

Attributes:
-Quake Intensity
-Wave Intensity
-Level Palette
-ESP Palette
-Tint Red Level (0-63, like ordinary ZC - should this be expanded to 0-255?)
-Tint Green Level
-Tint Blue Level

....no, use scripts.

=== @ P-Tux7 04/02/2023 03:30

i've seen several different quests use the same generic "hit switch, screen shakes, secret sound" script, and since we already have two of those as in-engine things now, i figure it would be highly convenient for at least quake effects to cut out the middleman of having to download a database script or code a boilerplate script and import it. it was inspired by the scriptless moving block cutscene in #2210 , actually

=== @ P-Tux7 04/02/2023 03:33

i suppose it's like, with moving platforms or somesuch, they shouldn't be in-engine because of all the little quirks and demands each person wanting to use them would have in mind, and that's where scripts come in. but since i, at least, cannot imagine much variance being needed in screen-shaking effects for cutscenes besides amplitude and length, then it doesn't really need to be a bespoke script and can just be in-engine. am i making sense?

(replying to @ P-Tux7 "i suppose it's like, with mov…"): ....yes, cramming a bunch of random stuff together in a combo type is not the way to handle it though

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 04/02/2023 23:18

and just having a combo *passively do shit* is generally not good
If, instead, perhaps, these were to be things you could cause to happen via *triggering a combo*.... that would be much saner

```
->Quake: [time]
->Wavy: [time]
->Load Level Palette: [dropdown]
->Load Boss Palette: [number]
->Tint [R][G][B]
->Clear Tint [checkbox]```
6 separate trigger outcomes possible
...some of these will be interesting to add and test.
might be a bit
