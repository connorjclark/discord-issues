Reported by obake-san for Splitting Darknuts in 2.10, but I imagine it extends to other splitting enemies. 

What SHOULD happen: One of the Blue Darknuts inherits the Ringleader status. When killed, all other enemies die.
What happens currently: Neither Blue Darknut inherits it and when killed, all other enemies do NOT die

Was used in a similar situation as the Armageddon Quest room with a Lanmola and Phantom Ghinis where you had to kill the Splitting Darknut to kill all the Ghinis.

Bizarrely, I could have sworn that splitting a Splitting Darknut in 2.50 counts as killing it for ringleader purposes...? I have a lot to check...
