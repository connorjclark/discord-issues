@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) take a look at this please

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 20:47

when I have energy, sure

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 22:15

```((weapon*)Lwpns.spr(Lwpns.Count()-1))->step = itm.misc1;``` spot the issue @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily)

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2022 22:15

🤷‍♀️

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 22:16

this->X += step

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 12/12/2022 22:16

...`misc1 / 100`?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/12/2022 22:16

Yuuup
the problem is that the weapon is being given a step value that instantly sends it flying offscreen

=== @ Lejes 12/12/2022 22:55

Yeah, sure enough. When I leave the step field as 0 the weapon is there.
