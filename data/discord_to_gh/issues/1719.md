For FUCKS sake I hate everything
@connorjclark (discord: connorclark) @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) adding to thread
So I did a think with the parser so that the github actions could like, y'know, check parsing
....and apparently it caused this to happen
and for the life of me
I have no idea why
everything *looks right*
If the `-unlinked` flag is not supplied, it should behave exactly as it did before

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:43

. . . oh, hmm
but
....there appear to be 2 identically named functions, `zconsole_info(const char* format, ...)`
.....wtf
how does that not generate some form of compile error?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 02:45

Why would it? zscript  target doesn't include the other one.

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:46

Not true
One copy is in `parser.cpp`, for only the zscript target
one copy is in `zscrdata.h`
and `parser.cpp`
has `#include "zscrdata.h"` in it
....changing the version in `zscrdata.h` to be named differently, and changing the reference to it in `zscrdata.h` and `zquest.cpp` to match, has in fact fixed this issue
so, that WAS the issue
I'm just confused as to why the fuck it didn't compile error in MSVC
because that seems like a major problem
OH WAIT
Nevermind
There's an `#ifdef`
which should prevent it
.....but then why the fuck did renaming it FIX THE BUG?

those shouldn't be compiled because of that ifndef
but it still
fucking changed it

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:53

NO WAIT
I'M FUCKING
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I CLICKED THE WRONG FUCKING FOLDER
OK, that did NOT fix it
I ran the wrong EXE
But
But
It worked in the one I ran
which was built AFTER the last change to the parser
So, is it broken ONLY IN DEBUG?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 02:56

no issue for me in debug x64
i'll try 32b

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:58

Yeah, I just built release and it is not broken
so something is fucked up here
either with debug builds, or with my debug test folder
but IDK what wrong with my folder could cause THAT

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 02:59

does using zscript on CLI directly work?
or at least print an error

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 02:59

That works, but that also runs entirely separate blocks of code
or, well, hmm
I would assume that works, but, that would be built in release for the test script, duh
so hmm

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 03:00

32b debug works for me

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:00

oh that's great
can you send me the build?

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 07/09/2022 03:00

shake the ghosts out of your compiler
hmm sure

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:00

I'm curious if your build will work for me or not
if not, then it's something somehow wrong with the folder

btw i only compiled the std header

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:05

The error occurred compiling an empty buffer, so
Something was wrong in a file somewhere
I copied all of that and replaced matching files

=== @ Majora 07/09/2022 03:05

huhwha
oh!

=== @EmilyV99 (discord: Emily) 07/09/2022 03:05

And it worked
and then
I put MY build back in the folder
....And it ALSO worked
So, something must have been wrong with something there that isn't an exe or dll

none of these files were the cause
SOMETHING else was though
....ghosts in my damn debug folder
(Could have been a damned config or something?)
anyway ty connor
