#deleted-channel @ Jared
What it was doing
well, I had something inside a loop
that was supposed to be AFTER the loop
so when it read `\16`
It was accidentally parsing that as `\1\16`
thus `\16\64` became `\1\16\6\64`
which is `change color to cset 16, color 6` followed by `insert capital A`
cset 16 wrapped to 0, it seems, as that yellow is cs0 color 6
(meta) thread name was changed: ‚úÖüîíString Bug?
