If the default tileset isn't supposed to have scripts, then I guess these need to be in as unscripted items.

added learn sword beam item
(meta) thread name was changed: Learn Slash, and Learn Sword Beam Items
might need a new QR that says you can't sword beam unless you have such an item?

Could be added the same as learn slash
Adding items for such things would be another whole thing to do

Bump (for the Learn Slash scroll, Magic Divisor ring is better-described in #1482 and so is #1479)

Sorry for all the passive item stuff - the expansion of string length (SCC viability), Signposts, Menus, etc. has really got my gears turning for the "passive ability" items

(You can also thank Haylee and Nightmare for inspiring me with their multi-class quests Nostalrul and whatever Nightmare's quest is, where adding and taking away ability items is pivotal to the class system)
