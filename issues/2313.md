When editing a combo, it used to be so that when you had the combo editor opened and pressed `t` the tile chooser would open up (rather than needing to click on the combo in the combo editor to open it). Currently it seems to do nothing, unless this functionality has been changed for some reason. Tried this in one of the more recent nightlies.

...it appears it currently will do so, *if you are on the tab with the tile showing*
or rather, it appears that it SHOULD, but it isn't working?
wtf
