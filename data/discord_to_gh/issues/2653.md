From pzc thread.

> Hopefully reporting three in one topic is fine. These are each about backwards compatibility with old v2.10 quests. These were found in Link's Decision 2. They work as intended in ZC v2.53, but not in ZC v2.55. I'm using alpha 112 build 13th Feb 2023 in the videos. The first two are also in earlier v2.10 quests, but the third has to be pretty rarely used so I don't know.

It doesn't happen when you have a cave/stairs that leads to the zelda1 screen 80. But when the cave leads to an actual screen, you can do it over and over. to see if I could figure out the cause, I tried changing the warp type from insta-warp to entrance, changing the room dmap from cave to dungeon to bs overworld, changing the level from 1 to 19 and even 0 just for fun.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 09/12/2023 20:05

eventually got fixed in 2.50, but some quests relied on the behavior so the bug got compatted

@Deedee speaking of armageddon quest
has the whole "door repairs in gamble dungeon never exhaust, they keep draining you every time you enter because it's in a dungeon" thing been emulated```

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 09/12/2023 20:52

but is the compat rule being applied correctly when loading old quests (I'd expect it to make that quest in Link's Decision 2 use the old behavior?)
or is it a matter of it being caught too late so there wasn't a perfect way to apply it based on qst versioning

=== @ P-Tux7 09/13/2023 01:22

LD2 was made in 2.10 so it seems like it should be kept in all versions 2.10 or less

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 07:39

not sure what to do here...

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 07:40

@arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) is this the QR? https://github.com/ZQuestClassic/ZQuestClassic/blob/8721621154b44903003c90b1ea1bf1a4f718d1e0/src/qst.cpp#L3185-L3188

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 07:41

just need to find the correct version to use here?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2023 12:51

I'm very confused

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2023 12:53

when making that commit I dug through the old versions we had and traced down what caused the bug and when it was fixed so I could replicate the bug faithfully for quests saved in the versions the bug was present in

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2023 13:02

but yeah that's the QR

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2023 13:19

okay tested in 2.10 and it doesn't happen there v.v damnit

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2023 13:28

wait, no, that's a special item room with 20 rupee

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2023 13:30

screen 1C map 1 is a cave with secret money
and I can confirm that it refills in both 2.10 and 2.55
so the bug is faithfully being replicated
and the special item money doesn't respawn for either version

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 19:56

Hmmm is it better to replicate this bug or assume quest authors intended to work as expected? Are there quests that expect buggy behavior here?

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2023 20:21

I think Liberation of Hyrule and maybe Armageddon Quest expected this behavior

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/23/2023 20:22

They used door repairs to have "no money past this point" zones; Liberation might have also had respawning secret money rooms but unsure

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 20:24

We could get really specific, and 

1) have bug fixed for all old quests
2) ...except for this small set of quests we KNOW relied on the bug
Or the inverse
Whatever list should be smaller..

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/23/2023 20:27

Tho I'm talking just about the money room, idk about the others here

=== @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) 12/24/2023 02:26

removing high priority label. maybe should just close.

=== @arceusplayer11 (discord: Deedee) 12/24/2023 18:21

(replying to @connorjclark (discord: connorclark) "We could get really specific,…"): that could work, though I'd definitely rather be on the "opt in to have the bug fixed" side of things cause we don't know what the intent is for people who might not be in the community anymore
